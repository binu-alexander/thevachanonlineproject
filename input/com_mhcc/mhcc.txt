Gen	Genesis is a name taken from the Greek, and signifies "the book ofgeneration or production;" it is properly so called, as containing anaccount of the origin of all things. There is no other history so old.There is nothing in the most ancient book which exists that contradictsit; while many things recorded by the oldest heathen writers, or to betraced in the customs of different nations, confirm what is related inthe book of Genesis.
Exo	The Book of Exodus relates the forming of the children of Israel into achurch and a nation. We have hitherto seen true religion shown indomestic life, now, we begin to trace its effects upon the concerns ofkingdoms and nations. Exodus signifies "the departure;" the chief eventtherein recorded is the departure of Israel from Egypt and Egyptianbondage; it plainly points out the fulfilling of several promises andprophecies to Abraham respecting his seed, and shadows forth the stateof the church, in the wilderness of this world, until her arrival atthe heavenly Canaan, an eternal rest.
Lev	God ordained divers kinds of oblations and sacrifices, to assure hispeople of the forgiveness of their offences, if they offered them intrue faith and obedience. Also he appointed the priests and Levites,their apparel, offices, conduct, and portion. He showed what feaststhey should observe, and at what times. He declared by these sacrificesand ceremonies, that the reward of sin is death, and that without theblood of Christ, the innocent Lamb of God, there can be no forgivenessof sins.
Num	This book is called NUMBERS from the several numberings of the peoplecontained in it. It extends from the giving of the law at Sinai, tilltheir arrival in the plains of Jordan. An account is given of theirmurmuring and unbelief, for which they were sentenced to wander in thewilderness nearly forty years; also some laws, both, moral andceremonial. Their trials greatly tended to distinguish the wicked andhypocrites from the faithful and true servants of God, who served himwith a pure heart.
Deu	This book repeats much of the history and of the laws contained in thethree foregoing books: Moses delivered it to Israel a little before hisdeath, both by word of mouth, that it might affect, and by writing,that it might abide. The men of that generation to which the law wasfirst given were all dead, and a new generation was sprung up, to whomGod would have it repeated by Moses himself, now they were going topossess the land of Canaan. The wonderful love of God to his church isset forth in this book; how he ever preserved his church for his ownmercies sake, and would still have his name called upon among them.Such are the general outlines of this book, the whole of which showsMoses' love for Israel, and marks him an eminent type of the Lord JesusChrist. Let us apply the exhortations and persuasions to our ownconsciences, to excite our minds to a believing, grateful obedience tothe commands of God.
Jos	Here is the history of Israel's passing into the land of Canaan,conquering and dividing it, under the command of Joshua, and theirhistory until his death. The power and truth of God in fulfilling hispromises to Israel, and in executing his justly threatened vengeance onthe Canaanites, are wonderfully displayed. This should teach us toregard the tremendous curses denounced in the word of God againstimpenitent sinners, and to seek refuge in Christ Jesus.
Jdg	The book of Judges is the history of Israel during the government ofthe Judges, who were occasional deliverers, raised up by God to rescueIsrael from their oppressors, to reform the state of religion, and toadminister justice to the people. The state of God's people does notappear in this book so prosperous, nor their character so religious, asmight have been expected; but there were many believers among them, andthe tabernacle service was attended to. The history exemplifies thefrequent warnings and predictions of Moses, and should have closeattention. The whole is full of important instruction.
Rth	We find in this book excellent examples of faith, piety, patience,humility, industry, and loving-kindness, in the common events of life.Also we see the special care which God's providence take of oursmallest concerns, encouraging us to full trust therein. We may viewthis book as a beautiful, because natural representation of human life;as a curious detail of important facts; and as a part of the plan ofredemption.
1Sa	In this book we have an account of Eli, and the wickedness of his sons;also of Samuel, his character and actions. Then of the advancement ofSaul to be the king of Israel, and his ill behaviour, until his deathmade way for David's succession to the throne, who was an eminent typeof Christ. David's patience, modesty, constancy, persecution by openenemies and feigned friends, are a pattern and example to the church,and to every member of it. Many things in this book encourage thefaith, hope, and patience of the suffering believer. It contains alsomany useful cautions and awful warnings.
2Sa	This book is the history of the reign of king David. It relates hisvictories, the growth of the prosperity of Israel, and his reformationof the state of religion. With these events are recorded the grievoussins he committed, and the family as well as public troubles with whichhe was punished. We here meet with many things worthy of imitation, andmany that are written for our warning. The history of king David isgiven in Scripture with much faithfulness, and from it he appears, tothose who fairly balance his many virtues and excellent qualitiesagainst his faults, to have been a great and good man.
1Ki	The history now before us accounts for the affairs of the kingdoms ofJudah and Israel, yet with special regard to the kingdom of God amongthem; for it is a sacred history. It is earlier as to time, teachesmuch more, and is more interesting than any common histories.
2Ki	Chapter 1
1Ch	The books of Chronicles are, in a great measure, repetitions of what isin the books of Samuel and of the Kings, yet there are some excellentuseful things in them which we find not elsewhere. The FIRST BOOKtraces the rise of the Jewish people from Adam, and afterward gives anaccount of the reign of David. In the SECOND BOOK the narrative iscontinued, and relates the progress and end of the kingdom of Judah;also it notices the return of the Jews from the Babylonish captivity.Jerome says, that whoever supposes himself to have knowledge of theScriptures without being acquainted with the books of Chronicles,deceives himself. Historical facts passed over elsewhere, names, andthe connexion of passages are to be found here, and many questionsconcerning the gospel are explained.
2Ch	Chapter 1
Ezr	The history of this book is the accomplishment of Jeremiah's prophecyconcerning the return of the Jews out of Babylon. From its contents weespecially learn, that every good work will meet with opposition fromenemies, and be hurt by the misconduct of friends; but that God willmake his cause to prevail, notwithstanding all obstacles andadversaries. The restoration of the Jews was an event of the highestconsequence, tending to preserve religion in the world, and preparingthe way for the appearance of the Great Deliverer, the Lord JesusChrist.
Neh	The Old Testament history closes with the book of Nehemiah, wherein isrecorded the workings of his heart, in the management of publicaffairs; with many devout reflections.
Est	We find in this book, that even those Jews who were scattered in theprovince of the heathen, were taken care of, and were wonderfullypreserved, when threatened with destruction. Though the name of God benot in this book, the finger of God is shown by minute events for thebringing about his people's deliverance. This history comes in betweenEzr 6; 7.
Job	This book is so called from Job, whose prosperity, afflictions, andrestoration, are here recorded. He lived soon after Abraham, or perhapsbefore that patriarch. Most likely it was written by Job himself, andit is the most ancient book in existence. The instructions to belearned from the patience of Job, and from his trials, are as usefulnow, and as much needed as ever. We live under the same Providence, wehave the same chastening Father, and there is the same need forcorrection unto righteousness. The fortitude and patience of Job,though not small, gave way in his severe troubles; but his faith wasfixed upon the coming of his Redeemer, and this gave him stedfastnessand constancy, though every other dependence, particularly the prideand boast of a self-righteous spirit, was tried and consumed. Anothergreat doctrine of the faith, particularly set forth in the book of Job,is that of Providence. It is plain, from this history, that the Lordwatched over his servant Job with the affection of a wise and lovingfather.
Psa	David was the penman of most of the psalms, but some evidently werecomposed by other writers, and the writers of some are doubtful. Butall were written by the inspiration of the Holy Ghost; and no part ofthe Old Testament is more frequently quoted or referred to in the New.Every psalm either points directly to Christ, in his person, hischaracter, and offices; or may lead the believer's thoughts to Him. Andthe psalms are the language of the believer's heart, whether mourningfor sin, thirsting after God, or rejoicing in Him. Whether burdenedwith affliction, struggling with temptation, or triumphing in the hopeor enjoyment of deliverance; whether admiring the Divine perfections,thanking God for his mercies, mediating on his truths, or delighting inhis service; they form a Divinely appointed standard of experience, bywhich we may judge ourselves. Their value, in this view, is very great,and the use of them will increase with the growth of the power of truereligion in the heart. By the psalmist's expressions, the Spirit helpsus to pray. If we make the psalms familiar to us, whatever we have toask at the throne of grace, by way of confession, petition, orthanksgiving, we may be assisted from thence. Whatever devout affectionis working in us, holy desire or hope, sorrow or joy, we may here findwords to clothe it; sound speech which cannot be condemned. In thelanguage of this Divine book, the prayers and praises of the churchhave been offered up to the throne of grace from age to age.
Pro	The subject of this book may be thus stated by an enlargement on theopening verses. 1. The Proverbs of Solomon, the son of David, king ofIsrael. 2. Which treat of the knowledge of wisdom, of piety towardsGod, of instruction and moral discipline, of the understanding wise andprudent counsels. 3. Which treat of the attainment of instruction inwisdom, which wisdom is to be shown in the conduct of life, andconsists in righteousness with regard to our fellow-creatures. 4. Whichtreat of the giving to the simple sagacity to discover what is right,by supplying them with just principles, and correct views of virtue andvice; and to the young man knowledge, so that he need not err throughignorance; and discretion, so that by pondering well these precepts, hemay not err through obstinacy. Take the proverbs of other nations, andwe shall find great numbers founded upon selfishness, cunning, pride,injustice, national contempt, and animosities. The principles of theProverbs of Solomon are piety, charity, justice, benevolence, and trueprudence. Their universal purity proves that they are the word of God.
Ecc	The name of this book signifies "The Preacher." The wisdom of God herepreaches to us, speaking by Solomon, who it is evident was the author.At the close of his life, being made sensible of his sin and folly, herecorded here his experience for the benefit of others, as the book ofhis repentance; and he pronounced all earthly good to be "vanity andvexation of spirit." It convinces us of the vanity of the world, andthat it cannot make us happy; of the vileness of sin, and its certaintendency to make us miserable. It shows that no created good cansatisfy the soul, and that happiness is to be found in God alone; andthis doctrine must, under the blessed Spirit's teaching, lead the heartto Christ Jesus.
Son	This book is a Divine allegory, which represents the love betweenChrist and his church of true believers, under figures taken from therelation and affection that subsist between a bridegroom and hisespoused bride; an emblem often employed in Scripture, as describingthe nearest, firmest, and most sure relation: see Ps. 45; Is. 54:5,6;62:5; Jer. 2:2; 3:1; also in Ezekiel, Hosea, and by our Lord himself,Matt. 9:15; 25:1: see also Rev. 21:2,9; Eph. 5:27. There is nocharacter in the church of Christ, and no situation in which thebeliever is placed, but what may be traced in this book, as humbleinquirers will find, on comparing it with other Scriptures, by theassistance of God the Holy Spirit, in answer to their supplications.Much, however, of the language has been misunderstood by expositors andtranslators. The difference between the customs and manners of Europe,and those of the East, must especially be kept in view. The littleacquaintance with eastern customs possessed by most of our earlyexpositors and translators, has in many cases prevented a correctrendering. Also, the changes in our own language, during the last twoor three centuries, affect the manner in which some expressions areviewed, and they must not be judged by modern notions. But the greatoutlines, rightly interpreted, fully accord with the affections andexperience of the sincere Christian.
Isa	Isaiah prophesied in the reigns of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah.He has been well called the evangelical prophet, on account of hisnumerous and full prophesies concerning the coming and character, theministry and preaching, the sufferings and death of the Messiah, andthe extent and continuance of his kingdom. Under the veil of thedeliverance from Babylon, Isaiah points to a much greater deliverance,which was to be effected by the Messiah; and seldom does he mention theone, without alluding at the same time to the other; nay, he is oftenso much enraptured with the prospect of the more distant deliverance,as to lose sight of that which was nearer, and to dwell on theMessiah's person, office, character, and kingdom.
Jer	Jeremiah was a priest, a native of Anathoth, in the tribe of Benjamin.He was called to the prophetic office when very young, about seventyyears after the death of Isaiah, and exercised it for about forty yearswith great faithfulness, till the sins of the Jewish nation came totheir full measure and destruction followed. The prophecies of Jeremiahdo not stand as they were delivered. Blayney has endeavoured to arrangethem in more regular order, namely, Jer. 1-20; 22; 23; 25; 26; 35; 36;45; 24; 29; 30; 31; 27; 28; 21; 34; 37; 32; 33; 38; 39:15-18,1-14;40-44; 46-52. The general subject of his prophecies is the idolatry andother sins of the Jews; the judgments by which they were threatened,with references to their future restoration and deliverance, andpromises of the Messiah. They are remarkable for plain and faithfulreproofs, affectionate expostulations, and awful warnings.
Lam	It is evident that Jeremiah was the author of the Lamentations whichbear his name. The book was not written till after the destruction ofJerusalem by the Chaldeans. May we be led to consider sin as the causeof all our calamities, and under trials exercise submission,repentance, faith, and prayer, with the hope of promised deliverancethrough God's mercy.
Eze	Ezekiel was one of the priests; he was carried captive to Chaldea withJehoiachin. All his prophecies appear to have been delivered in thatcountry, at some place north of Babylon. Their chief object appears tohave been to comfort his brethren in captivity. He is directed to warnof the dreadful calamities coming upon Judea, particularly upon thefalse prophets, and the neighbouring nations. Also to announce thefuture restoration of Israel and Judah from their several dispersions,and their happy state in their latter days, under the Messiah. Much ofChrist will be found in this book, especially in the conclusion.
Dan	Daniel was of noble birth, if not one of the royal family of Judah. Hewas carried captive to Babylon in the fourth year of Jehoiachin, B. C.606, when a youth. He was there taught the learning of the Chaldeans,and held high offices, both under the Babylonian and Persian empires.He was persecuted for his religion, but was miraculously delivered; andlived to a great age, as he must have been about ninety-four years oldat the time of the last of his visions. The book of Daniel is partlyhistorical, relating various circumstances which befel himself and theJews, at Babylon; but is chiefly prophetical, detailing visions andprophecies which foretell numerous important events relative to thefour great empires of the world, the coming and death of the Messiah,the restoration of the Jews, and the conversion of the Gentiles. Thoughthere are considerable difficulties in explaining the propheticalmeaning of some passages in this book, we always find encouragement tofaith and hope, examples worthy of imitation, and something to directour thoughts to Christ Jesus upon the cross and on his glorious throne.
Hos	Hosea is supposed to have been of the kingdom of Israel. He lived andprophesied during a long period. The scope of his predictions appearsto be, to detect, reprove, and convince the Jewish nation in general,and the Israelites in particular, of their many sins, particularlytheir idolatry: the corrupt state of the kingdom is also noticed. Buthe invites them to repentance, with promises of mercy, and gospelpredictions of the future restoration of the Israelites and of theJews, and their final conversion to Christianity.
Joe	From the desolations about to come upon the land of Judah, by theravages of locusts and other insects, the prophet Joel exhorts the Jewsto repentance, fasting, and prayer. He notices the blessings of thegospel, with the final glorious state of the church.
Amo	Amos was a herdsman, and engaged in agriculture. But the same DivineSpirit influenced Isaiah and Daniel in the court, and Amos in thesheep-folds, giving to each the powers and eloquence needful for them.He assures the twelve tribes of the destruction of the neighbouringnations; and as they at that time gave themselves up to wickedness andidolatry, he reproves the Jewish nation with severity; but describesthe restoration of the church by the Messiah, extending to the latterdays.
Oba	The first part denounces the destruction of Edom, dwelling upon theinjuries they inflicted upon the Jews. The second foretells therestoration of the Jews, and the latter glories of the church.
Jon	Jonah was a native of Galilee, 2Ki 14:25. His miraculous deliverancefrom out of the fish, rendered him a type of our blessed Lord, whomentions it, so as to show the certain truth of the narrative. All thatwas done was easy to the almighty power of the Author and Sustainer oflife. This book shows us, by the example of the Ninevites, how greatare the Divine forbearance and long-suffering towards sinners. It showsa most striking contrast between the goodness and mercy of God, and therebellion, impatience, and peevishness of his servant; and it will bebest understood by those who are most acquainted with their own hearts.
Mic	Micah was raised up to support Isaiah, and to confirm his predictions,while he invited to repentance, both by threatened judgments andpromised mercies. A very remarkable passage, Mic 5 contains a summaryof prophecies concerning the Messiah.
Nah	This prophet denounces the certain and approaching destruction of theAssyrian empire, particularly of Nineveh, which is described veryminutely. Together with this is consolation for his countrymen,encouraging them to trust in God.
Hab	The subject of this prophecy is the destruction of Judea and Jerusalemfor the sins of the people, and the consolation of the faithful undernational calamities.
Zep	Zephaniah excites to repentance, foretells the destruction of theenemies of the Jews, and comforts the pious among them with promises offuture blessings, the restoration of their nation, and the prosperityof the church in the latter days.
Hag	After the return from captivity, Haggai was sent to encourage thepeople to rebuild the temple, and to reprove their neglect. Toencourage their undertaking, the people are assured that the glory ofthe second temple shall far exceed that of the first, by the appearingtherein of Christ, the Desire of all nations.
Zec	This prophecy is suitable to all, as the scope is to reprove for sin,and threaten God's judgments against the impenitent, and to encouragethose that feared God, with assurances of the mercy God had in storefor his church, and especially of the coming of the Messiah, and thesetting up his kingdom in the world.
Mal	Malachi was the last of the prophets, and is supposed to haveprophesied B.C. 420. He reproves the priests and the people for theevil practices into which they had fallen, and invites them torepentance and reformation, with promises of the blessings to bebestowed at the coming of the Messiah. And now that prophecy was tocease, he speaks clearly of the Messiah, as nigh at hand, and directsthe people of God to keep in rememberance the law of Moses, while theywere in expectation of the gospel of Christ.
Mat	Matthew, surnamed Levi, before his conversion was a publican, ortax-gatherer under the Romans at Capernaum. He is generally allowed tohave written his Gospel before any other of the evangelists. Thecontents of this Gospel, and the evidence of ancient writers, show thatit was written primarily for the use of the Jewish nation. Thefulfilment of prophecy was regarded by the Jews as strong evidence,therefore this is especially dwelt upon by St. Matthew. Here areparticularly selected such parts of our Saviour's history anddiscourses as were best suited to awaken the Jewish nation to a senseof their sins; to remove their erroneous expectations of an earthlykingdom; to abate their pride and self-conceit; to teach them thespiritual nature and extent of the gospel; and to prepare them for theadmission of the Gentiles into the church.
Mar	Mark was a sister's son to Barnabas, Col 4:10; and Ac 12:12 shows thathe was the son of Mary, a pious woman of Jerusalem, at whose house theapostles and first Christians assembled. From Peter's styling him hisson, 1Pe 5:13, the evangelist is supposed to have been converted bythat apostle. Thus Mark was closely united with the followers of ourLord, if not himself one of the number. Mark wrote at Rome; somesuppose that Peter dictated to him, though the general testimony is,that the apostle having preached at Rome, Mark, who was the apostle'scompanion, and had a clear understanding of what Peter delivered, wasdesired to commit the particulars to writing. And we may remark, thatthe great humility of Peter is very plain where any thing is said abouthimself. Scarcely an action or a work of Christ is mentioned, at whichthis apostle was not present, and the minuteness shows that the factswere related by an eye-witness. This Gospel records more of themiracles than of the discourses of our Lord, and though in many thingsit relates the same things as the Gospel according to St. Matthew, wemay reap advantages from reviewing the same events, placed by each ofthe evangelists in that point of view which most affected his own mind.
Luk	This evangelist is generally supposed to have been a physician, and acompanion of the apostle Paul. The style of his writings, and hisacquaintance with the Jewish rites and usages, sufficiently show thathe was a Jew, while his knowledge of the Greek language and his name,speak his Gentile origin. He is first mentioned Ac 16:10,11, as withPaul at Troas, whence he attended him to Jerusalem, and was with him inhis voyage, and in his imprisonment at Rome. This Gospel appears to bedesigned to supersede many defective and unauthentic narratives incirculation, and to give a genuine and inspired account of the life,miracles, and doctrines of our Lord, learned from those who heard andwitnessed his discourses and miracles.
Joh	The apostle and evangelist, John, seems to have been the youngest ofthe twelve. He was especially favoured with our Lord's regard andconfidence, so as to be spoken of as the disciple whom Jesus loved. Hewas very sincerely attached to his Master. He exercised his ministry atJerusalem with much success, and outlived the destruction of that city,agreeably to Christ's prediction, ch. 21:22. History relates that afterthe death of Christ's mother, John resided chiefly at Ephesus. Towardsthe close of Domitian's reign he was banished to the isle of Patmos,where he wrote his Revelation. On the accession of Nerva, he was set atliberty, and returned to Ephesus, where it is thought he wrote hisGospel and Epistles, about A. D. 97, and died soon after. The design ofthis Gospel appears to be to convey to the Christian world, justnotions of the real nature, office, and character of that DivineTeacher, who came to instruct and to redeem mankind. For this purpose,John was directed to select for his narrative, those passages of ourSaviour's life, which most clearly displayed his Divine power andauthority; and those of his discourses, in which he spake most plainlyof his own nature, and of the power of his death, as an atonement forthe sins of the world. By omitting, or only briefly mentioning, theevents recorded by the other evangelists, John gave testimony thattheir narratives are true, and left room for the doctrinal statementsalready mentioned, and for particulars omitted in the other Gospels,many of which are exceedingly important.
Act	This book unites the Gospels to the Epistles. It contains manyparticulars concerning the apostles Peter and Paul, and of theChristian church from the ascension of our Saviour to the arrival ofSt. Paul at Rome, a space of about thirty years. St. Luke was thewriter of this book; he was present at many of the events he relates,and attended Paul to Rome. But the narrative does not afford a completehistory of the church during the time to which it refers, nor even ofSt. Paul's life. The object of the book has been considered to be, 1.To relate in what manner the gifts of the Holy Spirit were communicatedon the day of Pentecost, and the miracles performed by the apostles, toconfirm the truth of Christianity, as showing that Christ'sdeclarations were really fulfilled. 2. To prove the claim of theGentiles to be admitted into the church of Christ. This is shown bymuch of the contents of the book. A large portion of the Acts isoccupied by the discourses or sermons of various persons, the languageand manner of which differ, and all of which will be found according tothe persons by whom they were delivered, and the occasions on whichthey were spoken. It seems that most of these discourses are only thesubstance of what was actually delivered. They relate neverthelessfully to Jesus as the Christ, the anointed Messiah.
Rom	The scope or design of the apostle in writing to the Romans appears tohave been, to answer the unbelieving, and to teach the believing Jew;to confirm the Christian and to convert the idolatrous Gentile; and toshow the Gentile convert as equal with the Jewish, in respect of hisreligious condition, and his rank in the Divine favour. These severaldesigns are brought into on view, by opposing or arguing with theinfidel or unbelieving Jew, in favour of the Christian or believingGentile. The way of a sinner's acceptance with God, or justification inhis sight, merely by grace, through faith in the righteousness ofChrist, without distinction of nations, is plainly stated. Thisdoctrine is cleared from the objections raised by Judaizing Christians,who were for making terms of acceptance with God by a mixture of thelaw and the gospel, and for shutting out the Gentiles from any share inthe blessings of salvation brought in by the Messiah. In theconclusion, holiness is further enforced by practical exhortations.
1Co	The Corinthian church contained some Jews, but more Gentiles, and theapostle had to contend with the superstition of the one, and the sinfulconduct of the other. The peace of this church was disturbed by falseteachers, who undermined the influence of the apostle. Two parties werethe result; one contending earnestly for the Jewish ceremonies, theother indulging in excesses contrary to the gospel, to which they wereespecially led by the luxury and the sins which prevailed around them.This epistle was written to rebuke some disorderly conduct, of whichthe apostle had been apprized, and to give advice as to some pointswhereon his judgment was requested by the Corinthians. Thus the scopewas twofold. 1. To apply suitable remedies to the disorders and abuseswhich prevailed among them. 2. To give satisfactory answers on all thepoints upon which his advice had been desired. The address, andChristian mildness, yet firmness, with which the apostle writes, andgoes on from general truths directly to oppose the errors and evilconduct of the Corinthians, is very remarkable. He states the truth andthe will of God, as to various matters, with great force of argumentand animation of style.
2Co	The second epistle to the Corinthians probably was written about a yearafter the first. Its contents are closely connected with those of theformer epistle. The manner in which the letter St. Paul formerly wrotehad been received, is particularly noticed; this was such as to fillhis heart with gratitude to God, who enabled him fully to discharge hisduty towards them. Many had shown marks of repentance, and amendedtheir conduct, but others still followed their false teachers; and asthe apostle delayed his visit, from his unwillingness to treat themwith severity, they charged him with levity and change of conduct.Also, with pride, vain-glory, and severity, and they spake of him withcontempt. In this epistle we find the same ardent affection towards thedisciples at Corinth, as in the former, the same zeal for the honour ofthe gospel, and the same boldness in giving Christian reproof. Thefirst six chapters are chiefly practical: the rest have more referenceto the state of the Corinthian church, but they contain many rules ofgeneral application.
Gal	The churches in Galatia were formed partly of converted Jews, andpartly of Gentile converts, as was generally the case. St. Paul assertshis apostolic character and the doctrines he taught, that he mightconfirm the Galatian churches in the faith of Christ, especially withrespect to the important point of justification by faith alone. Thusthe subject is mainly the same as that which is discussed in theepistle to the Romans, that is, justification by faith alone. In thisepistle, however, attention is particularly directed to the point, thatmen are justified by faith without the works of the law of Moses. Ofthe importance of the doctrines prominently set forth in this epistle,Luther thus speaks: "We have to fear as the greatest and nearestdanger, lest Satan take from us this doctrine of faith, and bring intothe church again the doctrine of works and of men's traditions.Wherefore it is very necessary that this doctrine be kept in continualpractice and public exercise, both of reading and hearing. If thisdoctrine be lost, then is also the doctrine of truth, life andsalvation, lost and gone."
Eph	This epistle was written when St. Paul was a prisoner at Rome. Thedesign appears to be to strengthen the Ephesians in the faith ofChrist, and to give exalted views of the love of God, and of thedignity and excellence of Christ, fortifying their minds against thescandal of the cross. He shows that they were saved by grace, and thathowever wretched they once were, they now had equal privileges with theJews. He encourages them to persevere in their Christian calling, andurges them to walk in a manner becoming their profession, faithfullydischarging the general and common duties of religion, and the specialduties of particular relations.
Phi	The Philippians felt a very deep interest for the apostle. The scope ofthe epistle is to confirm them in the faith, to encourage them to walkas becomes the gospel of Christ, to caution them against judaizingteachers, and to express gratitude for their Christian bounty. Thisepistle is the only one, among those written by St. Paul, in which nocensures are implied or expressed. Full commendation and confidence arein every part, and the Philippians are addressed with a peculiaraffection, which every serious reader will perceive.
Col	This epistle was sent because of some difficulties which arose amongthe Colossians, probably from false teachers, in consequence of whichthey sent to the apostle. The scope of the epistle is to show, that allhope of man's redemption is founded on Christ, in whom alone are allcomplete fulness, perfections, and sufficiency. The Colossians arecautioned against the devices of judaizing teachers, and also againstthe notions of carnal wisdom, and human inventions and traditions, asnot consistent with full reliance on Christ. In the first two chaptersthe apostle tells them what they must believe, and in the two last whatthey must do; the doctrine of faith, and the precepts of life forsalvation.
1Th	This epistle is generally considered to have been the first of thosewritten by St. Paul. The occasion seems to have been the good report ofthe stedfastness of the church at Thessalonica in the faith of thegospel. It is full of affection and confidence, and more consolatoryand practical, and less doctrinal, than some of the other epistles.
2Th	The second epistle to the Thessalonians was written soon after thefirst. The apostle was told that, from some expressions in his firstletter, many expected the second coming of Christ was at hand, and thatthe day of judgment would arrive in their time. Some of these neglectedtheir worldly duties. St. Paul wrote again to correct their error,which hindered the spread of the gospel. He had written agreeably tothe words of the prophets of the Old Testament; and he tells them therewere many counsels of the Most High yet to be fulfilled, before thatday of the Lord should come, though, because it is sure, he had spokenof it as near. The subject led to a remarkable foretelling, of some ofthe future events which were to take place in the after-ages of theChristian church, and which show the prophetic spirit the apostlepossessed.
1Ti	The design of the epistle appears to be, that Timothy having been leftat Ephesus, St. Paul wrote to instruct him in the choice of properofficers in the church, as well as in the exercise of a regularministry. Also, to caution against the influence of false teachers, whoby subtle distinctions and endless disputes, corrupted the purity andsimplicity of the gospel. He presses upon him constant regard to thegreatest diligence, faithfulness, and zeal. These subjects occupy thefirst four chapters; the fifth chapter instructs respecting particularclasses; in the latter part, controversies and disputes are condemned,the love of money blamed, and the rich exhorted to good works.
2Ti	The first design of this epistle seems to have been, to apprize Timothyof what had occurred during the imprisonment of the apostle, and torequest him to come to Rome. But being uncertain whether he should besuffered to live to see him, Paul gives a variety of advices andencouragements, for the faithful discharge of his ministerial duties.As this was a private epistle written to St. Paul's most intimatefriend, under the miseries of imprisonment, and in the near prospect ofdeath, it shows the temper and character of the apostle, and containsconvincing proofs that he sincerely believed the doctrines he preached.
Tit	This epistle chiefly contains directions to Titus concerning the eldersof the Church, and the manner in which he should give instruction; andthe latter part tells him to urge obedience to magistrates, to enforcegood works, avoid foolish questions, and shun heresies. Theinstructions the apostle gave are all plain and simple. The Christianreligion was not formed to answer worldly or selfish views, but it isthe wisdom of God and the power of God.
Phm	Philemon was an inhabitant of Colosse, a person of some note andwealth, and a convert under the ministry of St. Paul. Onesimus was theslave of Philemon: having run away from his master, he went to Rome,where he was converted to the Christian faith, by the word as set forthby Paul, who kept him till his conduct proved the truth and sincerityof his conversion. He wished to repair the injury he had done to hismaster, but fearing the punishment his offence deserved might beinflicted, he entreated the apostle to write to Philemon. And St. Paulseems no where to reason more beautifully, or to entreat more forcibly,than in this epistle.
Heb	This epistle shows Christ as the end, foundation, body, and truth ofthe figures of the law, which of themselves were no virtue for thesoul. The great truth set forth in this epistle is that Jesus ofNazareth is the true God. The unconverted Jews used many arguments todraw their converted brethren from the Christian faith. Theyrepresented the law of Moses as superior to the Christian dispensation,and spoke against every thing connected with the Saviour. The apostle,therefore, shows the superiority of Jesus of Nazareth, as the Son ofGod, and the benefits from his sufferings and death as the sacrificefor sin, so that the Christian religion is much more excellent andperfect than that of Moses. And the principal design seems to be, tobring the converted Hebrews forward in the knowledge of the gospel, andthus to establish them in the Christian faith, and to prevent theirturning from it, against which they are earnestly warned. But while itcontains many things suitable to the Hebrews of early times, it alsocontains many which can never cease to interest the church of God; forthe knowledge of Jesus Christ is the very marrow and kernel of all theScriptures. The ceremonial law is full of Christ, and all the gospel isfull of Christ; the blessed lines of both Testaments meet in Him; andhow they both agree and sweetly unite in Jesus Christ, is the chiefobject of the epistle to the Hebrews to discover.
Jam	This epistle of James is one of the most instructive writings in theNew Testament. Being chiefly directed against particular errors at thattime brought in among the Jewish Christians, it does not contain thesame full doctrinal statements as the other epistles, but it presentsan admirable summary of the practical duties of all believers. Theleading truths of Christianity are set forth throughout; and onattentive consideration, it will be found entirely to agree with St.Paul's statements concerning grace and justification, while it aboundswith earnest exhortations to the patience of hope and obedience offaith and love, interspersed with warnings, reproofs, andencouragements, according to the characters addressed. The truths laiddown are very serious, and necessary to be maintained; and the rulesfor practice ought to be observed in all times. In Christ there are nodead and sapless branches, faith is not an idle grace; wherever it is,it brings forth fruit in works.
1Pe	The same great doctrines, as in St. Paul's epistles, are here appliedto same practical purposes. And this epistle is remarkable for thesweetness, gentleness, and humble love, with which it is written. Itgives a short, and yet a very clear summary, both of the consolationsand the instructions needful for the encouragement and direction of aChristian in his journey to heaven, raising his thoughts and desires tothat happiness, and strengthening him against all opposition in theway, both from corruption within, and temptations and afflictionswithout.
2Pe	This epistle clearly is connected with the former epistle of Peter. Theapostle having stated the blessings to which God has called Christians,exhorts those who had received these precious gifts, to endeavour toimprove in graces and virtues. They are urged to this from thewickedness of false teachers. They are guarded against impostors andscoffers, by disproving their false assertions, ch. 3:1-7, and byshowing why the great day of Christ's coming was delayed, with adescription of its awful circumstances and consequences; and suitableexhortations to diligence and holiness are given.
1Jo	This epistle is a discourse upon the principles of Christianity, indoctrine and practice. The design appears to be, to refute and guardagainst erroneous and unholy tenets, principles, and practices,especially such as would lower the Godhead of Christ, and the realityand power of his sufferings and death, as an atoning sacrifice; andagainst the assertion that believers being saved by grace, are notrequired to obey the commandments. This epistle also stirs up all whoprofess to know God, to have communion with him, and to believe in him,and that they walk in holiness, not in sin, showing that a mere outwardprofession is nothing, without the evidence of a holy life and conduct.It also helps forward and excites real Christians to communion with Godand the Lord Jesus Christ, to constancy in the true faith, and topurity of life.
2Jo	This epistle is like an abridgement of the first; it touches, in fewwords, on the same points. The Lady Electa is commended for hervirtuous and religious education of her children; is exhorted to abidein the doctrine of Christ, to persevere in the truth, and carefully toavoid the delusions of false teachers. But chiefly the apostlebeseeches her to practise the great commandment of Christian love andcharity.
3Jo	This epistle is addressed to a converted Gentile. The scope is tocommend his stedfastness in the faith, and his hospitality, especiallyto the ministers of Christ.
Jud	This epistle is addressed to all believers in the gospel. Its designappears to be to guard believers against the false teachers who hadbegun to creep into the Christian church, and to scatter dangeroustenets, by attempting to lower all Christianity into a merely nominalbelief and outward profession of the gospel. Having thus denied theobligations of personal holiness, they taught their disciples to livein sinful courses, at the same time flattering them with the hope ofeternal life. The vile character of these seducers is shown, and theirsentence is denounced, and the epistle concludes with warnings,admonitions, and counsels to believers.
Rev	The Book of the Revelation of St. John consists of two principaldivisions. 1. Relates to "the things which are," that is, the thenpresent state of the church, and contains the epistle of John to theseven churches, and his account of the appearance of the Lord Jesus,and his direction to the apostle to write what he beheld, ch. 1:9-20.Also the addresses or epistles to seven churches of Asia. These,doubtless, had reference to the state of the respective churches, asthey then existed, but contain excellent precepts and exhortations,commendations and reproofs, promises and threatenings, suitable toinstruct the Christian church at all times. 2. Contains a prophecy of"the things which shall be hereafter," and describes the future stateof the church, from the time when the apostle beheld the visions hererecorded. It is intended for our spiritual improvement; to warn thecareless sinner, point out the way of salvation to the awakenedinquirer, build up the weak believer, comfort the afflicted and temptedChristian, and, we may especially add, to strengthen the martyr ofChrist, under the cruel persecutions and sufferings inflicted by Satanand his followers.

Gen 36:	<b>Overview</b><br>Esau and his descendants.<br>--The registers in this chapter show the faithfulness of God to hispromise to Abraham. Esau is here called Edom, that name which kept upthe remembrance of his selling his birth-right for a mess of pottage.Esau continued the same profane despiser of heavenly things. In outwardprosperity and honour, the children of the covenant are often behind,and those that are out of the covenant get the start. We may suppose ita trial to the faith of God's Israel, to hear of the pomp and power ofthe kings of Edom, while they were bond-slaves in Egypt; but those thatlook for great things from God, must be content to wait for them; God'stime is the best time. Mount Seir is called the land of theirpossession. Canaan was at this time only the land of promise. Seir wasin the possession of the Edomites. The children of this world havetheir all in hand, and nothing in hope, Lu 16:25; while the children ofGod have their all in hope, and next to nothing in hand. But, allthings considered, it is beyond compare better to have Canaan inpromise, than mount Seir in possession.

Gen 38:	<b>Overview</b><br>The profligate conduct of Judah and his family.<br>--This chapter gives an account of Judah and his family, and such anaccount it is, that it seems a wonder that of all Jacob's sons, ourLord should spring out of Judah, Heb 7:14. But God will show that hischoice is of grace and not of merit, and that Christ came into theworld to save sinners, even the chief. Also, that the worthiness ofChrist is of himself, and not from his ancestors. How little reason hadthe Jews, who were so called from this Judah, to boast as they did, Joh8:41. What awful examples the Lord proclaims in his punishments, of hisutter displeasure at sin! Let us seek grace from God to avoid everyappearance of sin. And let that state of humbleness to which Jesussubmitted, when he came to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself, inappointing such characters as those here recorded, to be his ancestors,endear the Redeemer to our hearts.

Let these scriptures lead our souls toremember, that if the grace of God has indeed appeared to us, then ithas taught us, and enabled us so to conduct ourselves by its holypower, that denying ungodliness and wordly lusts, we should livesoberly, righteously, and godly in this present world, Tit 2:12.

Thus should we serve God, and our superiors also, in allthings lawful. Thus should all who are in public trusts abhor filthylucre, and avoid all occasions and temptations to covetousness. Wherehave we the representation of God's love towards us, that we by lovedwell in him and he in us, save in Emmanuel? Mt 1:23. This is the sumof the ministry of reconciliation, 2Co 5:18,19. This was the design ofthe "tabernacle of witness," a visible testimony of the love of God tothe race of men, however they were fallen from their first state. Andthis love was shown by Christ's taking up his abode on earth; by theWord being made flesh, Joh 1:14, wherein, as the original expresses it,he did tabernacle among us.

Lev 11:	<b>Overview</b><br>What animals were clean and unclean.<br>--These laws seem to have been intended, 1. As a test of the people'sobedience, as Adam was forbidden to eat of the tree of knowledge; andto teach them self-denial, and the government of their appetites. 2. Tokeep the Israelites distinct from other nations. Many also of theseforbidden animals were objects of superstition and idolatry to theheathen. 3. The people were taught to make distinctions between theholy and unholy in their companions and intimate connexions. 4. The lawforbad, not only the eating of the unclean beasts, but the touching ofthem. Those who would be kept from any sin, must be careful to avoidall temptations to it, or coming near it. The exceptions are veryminute, and all were designed to call forth constant care and exactnessin their obedience; and to teach us to obey. Whilst we enjoy ourChristian liberty, and are free from such burdensome observances, wemust be careful not to abuse our liberty. For the Lord hath redeemedand called his people, that they may be holy, even as he is holy. Wemust come out, and be separate from the world; we must leave thecompany of the ungodly, and all needless connexions with those who aredead in sin; we must be zealous of good works devoted followers of God,and companions of his people.
Lev 12:	<b>Overview</b><br>Ceremonial purification.<br>--After the laws concerning clean and unclean food, come the lawsconcerning clean and unclean persons. Man imparts his depraved natureto his offspring, so that, excepting as the atonement of Christ and thesanctification of the Spirit prevent, the original blessing, "Increaseand multiply," Ge 1:28, is become to the fallen race a direful curse,and communicates sin and misery. Let those women who have receivedmercy from God in child-bearing, with all thankfulness own God'sgoodness to them; and this shall please the Lord better thansacrifices.

Lev 15:	<b>Overview</b><br>Laws concerning ceremonial uncleanness.<br>--We need not be curious in explaining these laws; but have reason tobe thankful that we need fear no defilement, except that of sin, norneed ceremonial and burdensome purifications. These laws remind us thatGod sees all things, even those which escape the notice of men. Thegreat gospel duties of faith and repentance are here signified, and thegreat gospel privileges of the application of Christ's blood to oursouls for our justification, and his grace for our sanctification.

Close and constant adherenceto God's ordinances is the most effectual preservative from gross sin.The grace of God only will secure us; that grace is to be expected onlyin the use of the means of grace. Nor does He ever leave any to theirhearts' lusts, till they have left him and his services.

Lev 21:	<b>Overview</b><br>Laws concerning the priests.<br>--As these priests were types of Christ, so all ministers must befollowers of him, that their example may teach others to imitate theSaviour. Without blemish, and separate from sinners, He executed hispriestly office on earth. What manner of persons then should hisministers be! But all are, if Christians, spiritual priests; theminister especially is called to set a good example, that the peoplemay follow it. Our bodily infirmities, blessed be God, cannot now shutus out from his service, from these privileges, or from his heavenlyglory. Many a healthful, beautiful soul is lodged in a feeble, deformedbody. And those who may not be suited for the work of the ministry, mayserve God with comfort in other duties in his church.
Lev 22:	<b>Overview</b><br>Laws concerning the priests and sacrifices.<br>--In this chapter we have divers laws concerning the priests andsacrifices, all for preserving the honour of the sanctuary. Let usrecollect with gratitude that our great High Priest cannot be hinderedby any thing from the discharge of his office. Let us also remember,that the Lord requires us to reverence his name, his truths, hisordinances, and commandments. Let us beware of hypocrisy, and examineourselves concerning our sinful defilements, seeking to be purifiedfrom them in the blood of Christ, and by his sanctifying Spirit.Whoever attempts to expiate his own sin, or draws near in the pride ofself-righteousness, puts as great an affront on Christ, as he who comesto the Lord's table from the gratification of sinful lusts. Nor can theminister who loves the souls of the people, suffer them to continue inthis dangerous delusion. He must call upon them, not only to repent oftheir sins, and forsake them; but to put their whole trust in theatonement of Christ, by faith in his name, for pardon and acceptancewith God; thus only will the Lord make them holy, as his own people.

Thechildren of Israel put themselves in their posts, without murmuring ordisputing; and as it was their safety, so it was their beauty. It isour duty and interest to be contented with the place allotted to us,and to endeavour to occupy it in a proper manner, without envying ormurmuring; without ambition or covetousness.

How could they imagine those gods should protectthem, that could not keep themselves from being stolen! To take themfor their own use, was a double crime; it showed they neither fearedGod, nor regarded man, but were lost both to godliness and honesty.What a folly was it for Micah to call those his gods, which he hadmade, when He only is to be worshipped by us as God, that made us!

Jdg 19:	<b>Overview</b><br>The wickedness of the men of Gibeah.<br>--The three remaining chapters of this book contain a very sad historyof the wickedness of the men of Gibeah, in Benjamin.

Jdg 20:	<b>Overview</b><br>The tribe of Benjamin nearly extirpated.<br>--The Israelites' abhorrence of the crime committed at Gibeah, andtheir resolution to punish the criminals, were right; but they formedtheir resolves with too much haste and self-confidence.

Jdg 21:	<b>Overview</b><br>The Israelites lament for the Benjamites.<br>--Israel lamented for the Benjamites, and were perplexed by the oaththey had taken, not to give their daughters to them in marriage. Menare more zealous to support their own authority than that of God. Theywould have acted better if they had repented of their rash oaths,brought sin-offerings, and sought forgiveness in the appointed way,rather than attempt to avoid the guilt of perjury by actions quite aswrong. That men can advise others to acts of treachery or violence, outof a sense of duty, forms a strong proof of the blindness of the humanmind when left to itself, and of the fatal effects of a conscienceunder ignorance and error.

We shall never bedelivered from all enemies till we get to heaven. God will preserve allhis people, 2Ti 4:18. Those who receive signal mercies from God, oughtto give him the glory. In the day that God delivered David, he sangthis song. While the mercy is fresh, and we are most affected with it,let the thank-offering be brought, to be kindled with the fire of thataffection. All his joys and hopes close, as all our hopes should do, inthe great Redeemer.

1Ch 1:	<b>Overview</b><br>Genealogies, Adam to Abraham.	(1-27)<br>The descendants of Abraham.	(28-54)
1Ch 2:	<b>Overview</b><br>Genealogies.<br>--We are now come to the register of the children of Israel, thatdistinguished people, who were to dwell alone, and not be reckonedamong the nations. But now, in Christ, all are welcome to his salvationwho come to him; all have equal privileges according to their faith inhim, their love and devotedness to him. All that is truly valuableconsists in the favour, peace, and image of God, and a life spent tohis glory, in promoting the welfare of our fellow-creatures.
1Ch 3:	<b>Overview</b><br>Genealogies.<br>--Of all the families of Israel, none were so illustrious as the familyof David: here we have a full account of it. From this family, asconcerning the flesh, Christ came. The attentive observer will perceivethat the children of the righteous enjoy many advantages.
1Ch 4:	<b>Overview</b><br>Genealogies.<br>--In this chapter we have a further account of Judah, the most numerousand most famous of all the tribes; also an account of Simeon. The mostremarkable person in this chapter is Jabez. We are not told upon whataccount Jabez was more honourable than his brethren; but we find thathe was a praying man. The way to be truly great, is to seek to do God'swill, and to pray earnestly. Here is the prayer he made. Jabez prayedto the living and true God, who alone can hear and answer prayer; and,in prayer he regarded him as a God in covenant with his people. He doesnot express his promise, but leaves it to be understood; he was afraidto promise in his own strength, and resolved to devote himself entirelyto God. Lord, if thou wilt bless me and keep me, do what thou wilt withme; I will be at thy command and disposal for ever. As the text readsit, this was the language of a most ardent and affectionate desire, Ohthat thou wouldest bless me! Four things Jabez prayed for. 1. That Godwould bless him indeed. Spiritual blessings are the best blessings:God's blessings are real things, and produce real effects. 2. That Hewould enlarge his coast. That God would enlarge our hearts, and soenlarge our portion in himself, and in the heavenly Canaan, ought to beour desire and prayer. 3. That God's hand might be with him. God's handwith us, to lead us, protect us, strengthen us, and to work all ourworks in us and for us, is a hand all-sufficient for us. 4. That hewould keep him from evil, the evil of sin, the evil of trouble, all theevil designs of his enemies, that they might not hurt, nor make him aJabez indeed, a man of sorrow. God granted that which he requested. Godis ever ready to hear prayer: his ear is not now heavy.
1Ch 5:	<b>Overview</b><br>Genealogies.<br>--This chapter gives some account of the two tribes and a half seatedon the east side of Jordan. They were made captives by the king ofAssyria, because they had forsaken the Lord. Only two things are hererecorded concerning these tribes. 1. They all shared in a victory.Happy is that people who live in harmony together, who assist eachother against the common enemies of their souls, trusting in the Lord,and calling upon him. 2. They shared in captivity. They would have thebest land, not considering that it lay most exposed. The desire ofearthly objects draws to a distance from God's ordinances, and preparesmen for destruction.
1Ch 6:	<b>Overview</b><br>Genealogies.<br>--We have an account of Levi in this chapter. The priests and Leviteswere more concerned than any other Israelites, to preserve theirdescent clear, and to be able to prove it; because all the honours andprivileges of their office depended upon their descent. Now, the Spiritof God calls ministers to their work, without any limit as to thefamilies they came from; and then, as now, though believers andministers may be very useful to the church, none but our great HighPriest can make atonement for sin, nor can any be accepted but throughhis atonement.
1Ch 7:	<b>Overview</b><br>Genealogies.<br>--Here is no account either of Zebulun or Dan. We can assign no reasonwhy they only should be omitted; but it is the disgrace of the tribe ofDan, that idolatry began in that colony which fixed in Laish, andcalled it Dan, Jud 18 and there one of the golden calves was set up byJeroboam. Dan is omitted, Re 7. Men become abominable when they forsakethe worship of the true God, for any creature object.
1Ch 8:	<b>Overview</b><br>Genealogies.<br>--Here is a larger list of Benjamin's tribe. We may suppose that manythings in these genealogies, which to us seem difficult, abrupt, andperplexed, were plain and easy at that time, and fully answered theintention for which they were published. Many great and mighty nationsthen were in being upon earth, and many illustrious men, whose namesare now wholly forgotten; while the names of multitudes of the Israelof God are here kept in everlasting remembrance. The memory of the justis blessed.
1Ch 9:	<b>Overview</b><br>Genealogies.<br>--This chapter expresses that one end of recording all thesegenealogies was, to direct the Jews, when they returned out ofcaptivity, with whom to unite, and where to reside. Here is an accountof the good state into which the affairs of religion were put, on thereturn from Babylon. Every one knew his charge. Work is likely to bedone well when every one knows the duty of his place, and makes abusiness of it. God is the God of order. Thus was the temple a figureof the heavenly one, where they rest not day nor night from praisingGod, Re 4:8. Blessed be His name, believers there shall, not in turn,but all together, without interruption, praise him night and day: maythe Lord make each of us fit for the inheritance of the saints inlight.
1Ch 10:	<b>Overview</b><br>The death of Saul.<br>--The design chiefly in view in these books of the Chronicles, appearsto be to preserve the records of the house of David. Therefore thewriter repeats not the history of Saul's reign, but only of his death,by which a way was made for David to the throne. And from the ruin ofSaul, we may learn, 1. That the sin of sinners will certainly find themout, sooner or later; Saul died for his transgression. 2. That no man'sgreatness can exempt him from the judgments of God. 3. Disobedience isa killing thing. Saul died for not keeping the word of the Lord. May bedelivered from unbelief, impatience, and despair. By waiting on theLord we shall obtain a kingdom that cannot be moved.

1Ch 14:	<b>Overview</b><br>David's victories.<br>--In this chapter we have an account of, 1. David's kingdomestablished. 2. His family built up. 3. His enemies defeated. This isrepeated from 2Sa 5. Let the fame of David be looked upon as a type andfigure of the exalted honour of the Son of David.
1Ch 15:	<b>Overview</b><br>Preparations for the removal of the ark.	(1-24)<br>The removal of the ark.	(25-29)
1Ch 16:	<b>Overview</b><br>The solemnity with which the ark was fixed.	(1-6)<br>David's psalm of praise.	(7-36)<br>Setting in order the worship of God.	(37-43)
1Ch 17:	<b>Overview</b><br>David's purposes; God's gracious promises.<br>--This chapter is the same as 2Sa 7. See what is there said upon it. Itis very observable that what in Samuel is said to be, "for thy word'ssake," is here said to be, "for thy servant's sake," 
1Ch 18:	<b>Overview</b><br>David's victories.<br>--This chapter is the same as 2Sa 8. Our good fight of faith, under theCaptain of our salvation, will end in everlasting triumph and peace.The happiness of Israel, through David's victories, and justgovernment, faintly shadowed forth the happiness of the redeemed in therealms above.
1Ch 19:	<b>Overview</b><br>David's wars.<br>--The history is here repeated which we read 2Sa 10. The only safety ofsinners consists in submitting to the Lord, seeking peace with him, andbecoming his servants. Let us assist each other in a good cause; butlet us fear lest, while made instruments of good to others, we shouldcome short of salvation, through unbelief and sin.
1Ch 20:	<b>Overview</b><br>David's wars.<br>--Though the Lord will severely correct the sins of his believingpeople, he will not leave them in the hands of their enemies. Hisassistance will overcome all advantages of number and strength of thosethat defy his Israel. All that trust in Christ, shall be made more thanconquerors through him that loveth them.
1Ch 21:	<b>Overview</b><br>David's numbering the people.<br>--No mention is made in this book of David's sin in the matter ofUriah, neither of the troubles that followed it: they had no needfulconnexion with the subjects here noted. But David's sin, in numberingthe people, is related: in the atonement made for that sin, there wasnotice of the place on which the temple should be built. The command toDavid to build an altar, was a blessed token of reconciliation. Godtestified his acceptance of David's offerings on this altar. ThusChrist was made sin, and a curse for us; it pleased the Lord to bruisehim, that through him, God might be to us, not a consuming Fire, but areconciled God. It is good to continue attendance on those ordinancesin which we have experienced the tokens of God's presence, and havefound that he is with us of a truth. Here God graciously met me,therefore I will still expect to meet him.

1Ch 23:	<b>Overview</b><br>David declares Solomon his successor.	(1-23)<br>The office of the Levites.	(24-32)
1Ch 24:	<b>Overview</b><br>The divisions of the priests and Levites.<br>--When every one has, knows, and keeps his place and work, the morethere are the better. In the mystical body of Christ, every member hasits use, for the good of the whole. Christ is High Priest over thehouse of God, to whom all believers, being made priests, are to be insubjection. In Christ, no difference is made between bond and free,elder and younger. The younger brethren, if faithful and sincere, shallbe no less acceptable to Christ than the fathers. May we all bechildren of the Lord, fitted to sing his praises for ever in his templeabove.
1Ch 25:	<b>Overview</b><br>The singers and musicians.<br>--David put those in order who were appointed to be singers andmusicians in the temple. To prophesy, in this place, means praising Godwith great earnestness and devout affections, under the influences ofthe Holy Spirit. In raising these affections, poetry and music wereemployed. If the Spirit of God do not put life and fervour into ourdevotions, they will, however ordered, be a lifeless, worthless form.
1Ch 26:	<b>Overview</b><br>The offices of the Levites.<br>--The porters and treasurers of the temple, had occasion for strengthand valour to oppose those who wrongly attempted to enter thesanctuary, and to guard the sacred treasures. Much was expended dailyupon the altar; flour, wine, oil, salt, fuel, beside the lamps;quantities of these were kept beforehand, besides the sacred vestmentsand utensils. These were the treasures of the house of God. Thesetreasures typified the plenty there is in our heavenly Father's house,enough and to spare. From those sacred treasuries, the unsearchableriches of Christ, all our wants are supplied; and receiving from hisfulness, we must give him the glory, and endeavour to dispose of ourabilities and substance according to his will. We have an account ofthose employed as officers and judges. The magistracy is an ordinanceof God for the good of the church, as truly as the ministry, and mustnot be neglected. None of the Levites who were employed in the serviceof the sanctuary, none of the singers or porters, were concerned inthis outward business; one duty was enough to engage the whole man.Wisdom, courage, strength of faith, holy affections, and constancy ofmind in doing our duty, are requisite or useful for every station.

2Ch 1:	<b>Overview</b><br>Solomon's choice of wisdom, His strength and wealth.<br>--SOLOMON began his reign with a pious, public visit to God's altar.Those that pursue present things most eagerly, are likely to bedisappointed; while those that refer themselves to the providence ofGod, if they have not the most, have the most comfort. Those that makethis world their end, come short of the other, and are disappointed inthis also; but those that make the other world their end, shall notonly obtain that, and full satisfaction in it, but shall have as muchof this world as is good for them, in their way. Let us then becontented, without those great things which men generally covet, butwhich commonly prove fatal snares to the soul.
2Ch 2:	<b>Overview</b><br>Solomon's message to Huram respecting the temple, His treaty withHuram.<br>--Solomon informs Huram of the particular services to be performed inthe temple. The mysteries of the true religion, unlike those of theGentile superstitions, sought not concealment. Solomon endeavoured topossess Huram with great and high thoughts of the God of Israel. Weshould not be afraid or ashamed to embrace every opportunity to speakof God, and to impress others with a deep sense of the importance ofhis favour and service. Now that the people of Israel kept close to thelaw and worship of God, the neighbouring nations were willing to betaught by them in the true religion, as the Israelites had been willingin the days of their apostacy, to be infected with the idolatries andsuperstitions of their neighbours. A wise and pious king is an evidenceof the Lord's special love for his people. How great then was God'slove to his believing people, in giving his only-begotten Son to betheir Prince and their Saviour.
2Ch 3:	<b>Overview</b><br>The building of the temple.<br>--There is a more particular account of the building of the temple in1Ki 6. It must be in the place David had prepared, not only which hehad purchased, but which he had fixed on by Divine direction. Fullinstructions enable us to go about our work with certainty and toproceed therein with comfort. Blessed be God, the Scriptures are enoughto render the man of God thoroughly furnished for every good work. Letus search the Scriptures daily, beseeching the Lord to enable us tounderstand, believe, and obey his word, that our work and our way maybe made plain, and that all may be begun, continued, and ended in him.Beholding God, in Christ, his true Temple, more glorious than that ofSolomon's, may we become a spiritual house, a habitation of God throughthe Spirit.
2Ch 4:	<b>Overview</b><br>The furniture of the temple.<br>--Here is a further account of the furniture of God's house. Bothwithout doors and within, there was that which typified the grace ofthe gospel, and shadowed out good things to come, of which thesubstance is Christ. There was the brazen altar. The making of this wasnot mentioned in the book of Kings. On this all the sacrifices wereoffered, and it sanctified the gift. The people who worshipped in thecourts might see the sacrifices burned. They might thus be led toconsider the great Sacrifice, to be offered in the fulness of time, totake away sin, and put an end to death, which the blood of bulls andgoats could not possibly do. And, with the smoke of the sacrifices,their hearts might ascend to heaven, in holy desires towards God andhis favour. In all our devotions we must keep the eye of faith fixedupon Christ. The furniture of the temple, compared with that of thetabernacle, showed that God's church would be enlarged, and hisworshippers multiplied. Blessed be God, there is enough in Christ forall.
2Ch 5:	<b>Overview</b><br>The ark placed in the temple.	(1-10)<br>The temple filled with glory.	(11-14)
2Ch 6:	<b>Overview</b><br>Solomon's prayer at the dedication of the temple.<br>--The order of Solomon's prayer is to be observed. First and chiefly,he prays for repentance and forgiveness, which is the chief blessing,and the only solid foundation of other mercies: he then prays fortemporal mercies; thereby teaching us what things to mind and desiremost in our prayers. This also Christ hath taught us in his perfectpattern and form of prayer, where there is but one prayer for outward,and all the rest are for spiritual blessings. The temple typified thehuman nature of Christ, in whom dwelleth all the fulness of the Godheadbodily. The ark typified his obedience and sufferings, by whichrepenting sinners have access to a reconciled God, and communion withhim. Jehovah has made our nature his resting-place for ever, in theperson of Emmanuel, and through him he dwells with, and delights in hischurch of redeemed sinners. May our hearts become his resting-place;may Christ dwell therein by faith, consecrating them as his temples,and shedding abroad his love therein. May the Father look upon us inand through his Anointed; and may he remember and bless us in allthings, according to his mercy to sinners, in and through Christ.
2Ch 7:	<b>Overview</b><br>God's answer to Solomon's prayer.<br>--God gave a gracious answer to Solomon's prayer. The mercies of God tosinners are made known in a manner well suited to impress all whoreceive them, with his majesty and holiness. The people worshipped andpraised God. When he manifests himself as a consuming Fire to sinners,his people can rejoice in him as their Light. Nay, they had reason tosay, that God was good in this. It is of the Lord's mercies we are notconsumed, but the sacrifice in our stead, for which we should be verythankful. And whoever beholds with true faith, the Saviour agonizingand dying for man's sin, will, by that view, find his godly sorrowenlarged, his hatred of sin increased, his soul made more watchful, andhis life more holy. Solomon prosperously effected all he designed, foradorning both God's house and his own. Those who begin with the serviceof God, are likely to go on successfully in their own affairs. It wasSolomon's praise, that what he undertook, he went through with; it wasby the grace of God that he prospered in it. Let us then stand in awe,and sin not. Let us fear the Lord's displeasure, hope in his mercy, andwalk in his commandments.
2Ch 8:	<b>Overview</b><br>Solomon's buildings and trade.<br>--It sometimes requires more wisdom and resolution to govern a familyin the fear of God, than to govern a kingdom with reputation. Thedifficulty is increased, when a man has a hinderance instead of a helpmeet in the wife of his bosom. Solomon kept up the holy sacrifices,according to the law of Moses. In vain had the altar been built, invain had fire come down from heaven, if sacrifices had not beenconstantly brought. Spiritual sacrifices are required of us, which weare to bring daily and weekly; it is good to be in a settled method ofdevotion. When the service of the temple was put into good order, it issaid, The house of the Lord was perfected. The work was the mainmatter, not the place; the temple was unfinished till all this wasdone. Canaan was a rich country, and yet must send to Ophir for goldThe Israelites were a wise people, but must be beholden to the king ofTyre for men that had knowledge of the seas. Grace, and not gold, isthe best riches, and acquaintance with God and his law, the bestknowledge. Leaving the children of this world to scramble for the toysof this world, may we, as the children of God, lay up our treasure inheaven, that where our treasure is, our hearts also may be.

2Ch 10:	<b>Overview</b><br>The ten tribes revolt from Rehoboam.<br>--Moderate counsels are wisest and best. Gentleness will do whatviolence will not do. Most people like to be accosted mildly. Goodwords cost only a little self-denial, yet they purchase great things.No more needs to be done to ruin men, than to leave them to their ownpride and passion. Thus, whatever are the devices of men, God is doinghis own work by all, and fulfilling the word which he has spoken. Noman can bequeath his prosperity to his heirs any more than his wisdom;though our children will generally be affected by our conduct, whethergood or bad. Let us then seek those good things which will be our ownfor ever; and crave the blessing of God upon our posterity, inpreference to wealth or worldly exaltation.
2Ch 11:	<b>Overview</b><br>Rehoboam forbidden to war against Israel.	(1-12)<br>The priests and Levites find refuge in Judah.	(13-23)
2Ch 12:	<b>Overview</b><br>Rehoboam, forsaking the Lord, is punished.<br>--When Rehoboam was so strong that he supposed he had nothing to fearfrom Jeroboam, he cast off his outward profession of godliness. It isvery common, but very lamentable, that men, who in distress or danger,or near death, seem much engaged in seeking and serving God, throwaside all their religion when they have received a mercifuldeliverance. God quickly brought troubles upon Judah, to awaken thepeople to repentance, before their hearts were hardened. Thus itbecomes us, when we are under the rebukes of Providence, to justifyGod, and to judge ourselves. If we have humbled hearts under humblingprovidences, the affliction has done its work; it shall be removed, orthe property of it be altered. The more God's service is compared withother services, the more reasonable and easy it will appear. Are thelaws of temperance thought hard? The effects of intemperance will befound much harder. The service of God is perfect liberty; the serviceof our lusts is complete slavery. Rehoboam was never rightly fixed inhis religion. He never quite cast off God; yet he engaged not his heartto seek the Lord. See what his fault was; he did not serve the Lord,because he did not seek the Lord. He did not pray, as Solomon, forwisdom and grace; he did not consult the word of God, did not seek tothat as his oracle, nor follow its directions. He made nothing of hisreligion, because he did not set his heart to it, nor ever came up to asteady resolution in it. He did evil, because he never was determinedfor good.
2Ch 13:	<b>Overview</b><br>Abijah overcomes Jeroboam.<br>--Jeroboam and his people, by apostacy and idolatry, merited the severepunishment Abijah was permitted to execute upon them. It appears fromthe character of Abijah, 1Ki 15:3, that he was not himself trulyreligious, yet he encouraged himself from the religion of his people.It is common for those that deny the power of godliness, to boast ofthe form of it. Many that have little religion themselves, value it inothers. But it was true that there were numbers of pious worshippers inJudah, and that theirs was the more righteous cause. In their distress,when danger was on every side, which way should they look fordeliverance unless upward? It is an unspeakable comfort, that our waythither is always open. They cried unto the Lord. Earnest prayer iscrying. To the cry of prayer they added the shout of faith, and becamemore than conquerors. Jeroboam escaped the sword of Abijah, but Godstruck him; there is no escaping his sword.
2Ch 14:	<b>Overview</b><br>Asa's piety, He strengthens his kingdom.<br>--Asa aimed at pleasing God, and studied to approve himself to him.Happy those that walk by this rule, not to do that which is right intheir own eyes, or in the eye of the world, but which is so in God'ssight. We find by experience that it is good to seek the Lord; it givesus rest; while we pursue the world, we meet with nothing but vexation.Asa consulted with his people how to make a good use of the peace theyenjoyed; and concluded with them that they must not be idle, norsecure. A formidable army of Ethiopians invaded Asa's kingdom. Thisevil came upon them, that their faith in God might be tried. Asa'sprayer is short, but it is the real language of faith and expectationfrom God. When we go forth in God's name, we cannot but prosper, andall things work together for the good of those whom he favours.
2Ch 15:	<b>Overview</b><br>The people make a solemn covenant with God.<br>--The work of complete reformation appeared so difficult, that Asa hadnot courage to attempt it, till assured of Divine assistance andacceptance. He and his people offered sacrifices to God; thanksgivingfor the favours they had received, and supplication for furtherfavours. Prayers and praises are now our spiritual sacrifices. Thepeople, of their own will, covenanted to seek the Lord, each forhimself, with earnestness. What is religion but seeking God, inquiringafter him, applying to him upon all occasions? We make nothing of ourreligion, if we do not make heart-work of it; God will have all theheart, or none. Our devotedness to God our Saviour, should be avowedand shown in the most solemn and public manner. What is done inhypocrisy is a mere drudgery.
2Ch 16:	<b>Overview</b><br>Asa seeks the aid of the Syrians, His death.<br>--A plain and faithful reproof was given to Asa by a prophet of theLord, for making a league with Syria. God is displeased when he isdistrusted, and when an arm of flesh is relied on, more than his powerand goodness. It is foolish to lean on a broken reed, when we have theRock of ages to rely upon. To convince Asa of his folly, the prophetshows that he, of all men, had no reason to distrust God, who had foundhim such a powerful Helper. The many experiences we have had of thegoodness of God to us, aggravate our distrust of him. But see howdeceitful our hearts are! we trust in God when we have nothing else totrust to, when need drives us to him; but when we have other things tostay on, we are apt to depend too much on them. Observe Asa'sdispleasure at this reproof. What is man, when God leaves him tohimself! He that abused his power for persecuting God's prophet, wasleft to himself, to abuse it further for crushing his own subjects. Twoyears before he died, Asa was diseased in his feet. Making use ofphysicians was his duty; but trusting to them, and expecting that fromthem which was to be had from God only, were his sin and folly. In allconflicts and sufferings we need especially to look to our own hearts,that they may be perfect towards God, by faith, patience, andobedience.
2Ch 17:	<b>Overview</b><br>Jehoshaphat promotes religion in Judah, His prosperity.<br>--Jehoshaphat found his people generally very ignorant, and thereforeendeavoured to have them well taught. The public teaching of the wordof God forms, in all ages, the great method of promoting the power ofgodliness. Thereby the understanding is informed, the conscience isawakened and directed. We have a particular account of Jehoshaphat'sprosperity. But it was not his formidable army that restrained theneighbouring nations from attempting any thing against Israel, but thefear of God which fell upon them, when Jehoshaphat reformed hiscountry, and set up a preaching ministry in it. The ordinances of Godare more the strength and safety of a kingdom, than soldiers andweapons of war. The Bible requires use to notice the hand of God inevery event, yet this is little regarded. But let all employ thetalents they have: be faithful, even in that which is little. Set upthe worship of God in your houses. The charge of a family is important.Why should you not instruct them as Jehoshaphat did his subjects, inthe book of the law of the Lord. But be consistent. Do not recommendone thing, and practise another. Begin with yourselves. Seek to theLord God of Israel, then call upon children and servants to follow yourexample.
2Ch 18:	<b>Overview</b><br>Jehoshaphat's alliance with Ahab.<br>--This history we read in 1Ki 22. Abundant riches and honour give largeopportunities of doing good, but they are attended with many snares andtemptations. Men do not know much of the artifices of Satan and thedeceitfulness of their own hearts, when they covet riches with the ideaof being able to do good with them. What can hurt those whom God willprotect? What can shelter those whom God will destroy? Jehoshaphat issafe in his robes, Ahab killed in his armour; for the race is not tothe swift, nor the battle to the strong. We should be cautious ofentangling ourselves in the worldly undertakings of evil men; and stillmore we should avoid engaging in their sinful projects. But, when theycall upon him, God can and will bring his faithful people out of thedifficulties and dangers into which they have sinfully run themselves.He has all hearts in his hand, so that he easily rescues them. Blessedis the man that putteth his trust in the Lord.
2Ch 19:	<b>Overview</b><br>Jehoshaphat visits his kingdom.<br>--Whenever we return in peace to our houses, we ought to acknowledgeGod's providence in preserving our going out and coming in. And if wehave been kept through more than common dangers, we are, in a specialmanner, bound to be thankful. Distinguishing mercies lay us understrong obligations. The prophet tells Jehoshaphat he had done very illin joining Ahab. He took the reproof well. See the effect the reproofhad upon him. He strictly searched his own kingdom. By what the prophetsaid, Jehoshaphat perceived that his former attempts for reformationwere well-pleasing to God; therefore he did what was then left undone.It is good when commendations quicken us to our duty. There arediversities of gifts and operations, but all from the same Spirit, andfor the public good; and as every one has received the gift, so let himminister the same. Blessed be God for magistrates and ministers,scribes and statesmen, men of books, and men of business. Observe thecharge the king gave. They must do all in the fear of the Lord, with aperfect, upright heart. And they must make it their constant care toprevent sin, as an offence to God, and what would bring wrath on thepeople.

2Ch 22:	<b>Overview</b><br>The reign of Ahaziah, Athaliah destroys the royal family.<br>--The counsel of the ungodly ruins many young persons when they aresetting out in the world. Ahaziah gave himself up to be led by evilmen. Those who advise us to do wickedly, counsel us to our destruction;while they pretend to be friends, they are our worst enemies. See anddread the mischief of bad company. If not the infection, yet let thedestruction be feared, Re 18:4. We have here, a wicked womanendeavouring to destroy the house of David, and a good woman preservingit. No word of God shall fall to the ground. The whole truth of theprophecies that the Messiah was to come from David, and thereby thesalvation of the world, appeared to be now hung upon the brittle threadof the life of a single infant, to destroy whom was the interest of thereigning power. But God had purposed, and vain were the efforts ofearth and hell.

2Ch 27:	<b>Overview</b><br>Jotham's reign in Judah.<br>--The people did corruptly. Perhaps Jotham was wanting towards thereformation of the land. Men may be very good, and yet not have courageand zeal to do what they might. It certainly casts blame upon thepeople. Jotham prospered, and became mighty. The more stedfast we arein religion, the more mighty we are, both to resist evil, and to dogood. The Lord often removes wise and pious rulers, and sends others,whose follies and vices punish a people that valued not their mercies.
2Ch 28:	<b>Overview</b><br>The wicked reign of Ahaz in Judah.<br>--Israel gained this victory because God was wroth with Judah, and madethem the rod of his indignation. He reminds them of their own sins. Itill becomes sinners to be cruel. Could they hope for the mercy of God,if they neither showed mercy nor justice to their brethren? Let it beremembered, that every man is our neighbour, our brother, our fellowman, if not our fellow Christian. And no man who is acquainted with theword of God, need fear to maintain that slavery is against the law oflove and the gospel of grace. Who can hold his brother in bondage,without breaking the rule of doing to others as he would they should dounto him? But when sinners are left to their own heart's lusts, theygrow more desperate in wickedness. God commands them to release theprisoners, and they obeyed. The Lord brought Judah low. Those who willnot humble themselves under the word of God, will justly be humbled byhis judgments. It is often found, that wicked men themselves have noreal affection for those that revolt to them, nor do they care to dothem a kindness. This is that king Ahaz! that wretched man! Those arewicked and vile indeed, that are made worse by their afflictions,instead of being made better by them; who, in their distress, trespassyet more, and have their hearts more fully set in them to do evil. Butno marvel that men's affections and devotions are misplaced, when theymistake the author of their trouble and of their help. The progress ofwickedness and misery is often rapid; and it is awful to reflect upon asinner's being driven away in his wickedness into the eternal world.

2Ch 31:	<b>Overview</b><br>Hezekiah destroys idolatry.<br>--After the passover, the people of Israel applied with vigour todestroy the monuments of idolatry. Public ordinances should stir us upto cleanse our hearts, our houses, and shops, from the filth of sin,and the idolatry of covetousness, and to excite others to do the same.The after-improvement of solemn ordinances, is of the greatestimportance to personal, family, and public religion. When they hadtasted the sweetness of God's ordinance in the late passover, they werefree in maintaining the temple service. Those who enjoy the benefit ofa settled ministry, will not grudge the expense of it. In all thatHezekiah attempted in God's service, he was earnest and single in hisaim and dependence, and was prospered accordingly. Whether we have fewor many talents intrusted to us, may we thus seek to improve them, andencourage others to do the same. What is undertaken with a sincereregard to the glory of God, will succeed to our own honour and comfortat last.

2Ch 34:	<b>Overview</b><br>Josiah's good reign in Judah.<br>--As the years of infancy cannot be useful to our fellow-creatures, ourearliest youth should be dedicated to God, that we may not waste any ofthe remaining short space of life. Happy and wise are those who seekthe Lord and prepare for usefulness at an early age, when others arepursuing sinful pleasures, contracting bad habits, and forming ruinousconnexions. Who can express the anguish prevented by early piety, andits blessed effects? Diligent self-examination and watchfulness willconvince us of the deceitfulness and wickedness of our own hearts, andthe sinfulness of our lives. We are here encouraged to humble ourselvesbefore God, and to seek unto him, as Josiah did. And believers are heretaught, not to fear death, but to welcome it, when it takes them awayfrom the evil to come. Nothing hastens the ruin of a people, nor ripensthem for it, more than their disregard of the attempts made for theirreformation. Be not deceived, God is not mocked. The current and tideof affections only turns at the command of Him who raises up those thatare dead in trespasses and sins. We behold peculiar loveliness, in thegrace the Lord bestows on those, who in tender years seek to know andto love the Saviour. Hath Jesus, the Day-spring from on high, visitedyou? Can you trace your knowledge of this light and life of man, likeJosiah, from your youth? Oh the unspeakable happiness of becomingacquainted with Jesus from our earliest years!

Neh 1:	<b>Overview</b><br>Nehemiah's distress for the misery of Jerusalem, His prayer.<br>--Nehemiah was the Persian king's cup-bearer. When God has work to do,he will never want instruments to do it with. Nehemiah lived at ease,and in honour, but does not forget that he is an Israelite, and thathis brethren are in distress. He was ready to do them all the goodoffices he could; and that he might know how best to do them akindness, he makes inquiries about them. We should inquire especiallyconcerning the state of the church and religion. Every Jerusalem onthis side the heavenly one will have some defect, which will requirethe help and services of its friends. Nehemiah's first application wasto God, that he might have the fuller confidence in his application tothe king. Our best pleas in prayer are taken from the promise of God,the word on which he has caused us to hope. Other means must be used,but the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man avails most.Communion with God will best prepare us for our dealings with men. Whenwe have intrusted our concerns to God, the mind is set at liberty; itfeels satisfaction and composure, and difficulties vanish. We know thatif the affair be hurtful, he can easily hinder it; and if it be goodfor us, he can as easily forward it.

Neh 3:	<b>Overview</b><br>The rebuilding the walls of Jerusalem.<br>--The work was divided, so that every one might know what he had to do,and mind it, with a desire to excel; yet without contention, orseparate interests. No strife appears among them, but which should domost for the public good. Every Israelite should lend a hand toward thebuilding up of Jerusalem. Let not nobles think any thing below them, bywhich they may advance the good of their country. Even some femaleshelped forward the work. Some repaired over against their houses, andone repaired over against his chamber. When a general good work is tobe done, each should apply himself to that part which is within hisreach. If every one will sweep before his own door, the street will beclean; if every one will mend one, we shall all be mended. Some thathad first done helped their fellows. The walls of Jerusalem, in heapsof rubbish, represent the desperate state of the world around, whilethe number and malice of those who hindered the building, give somefaint idea of the enemies we have to contend with, while executing thework of God. Every one must begin at home; for it is by getting thework of God advanced in our own souls that we shall best contribute tothe good of the church of Christ. May the Lord thus stir up the heartsof his people, to lay aside their petty disputes, and to disregardtheir worldly interests, compared with building the walls of Jerusalem,and defending the cause of truth and godliness against the assaults ofavowed enemies.

Neh 11:	<b>Overview</b><br>The distribution of the people.<br>--In all ages, men have preferred their own ease and advantage to thepublic good. Even the professors of religion too commonly seek theirown, and not the things of Christ. Few have had such attachment to holythings and holy places, as to renounce pleasure for their sake. Yetsurely, our souls should delight to dwell where holy persons andopportunities of spiritual improvement most abound. If we have not thislove to the city of our God, and to every thing that assists ourcommunion with the Saviour, how shall we be willing to depart hence; tobe absent from the body, that we may be present with the Lord? To thecarnal-minded, the perfect holiness of the New Jerusalem would be stillharder to bear than the holiness of God's church on earth. Let us seekfirst the favour of God, and his glory; let us study to be patient,contented, and useful in our several stations, and wait, with cheerfulhope, for admission into the holy city of God.

Mordecai was truly great, and his greatness gave himopportunities of doing the more good. He did not disown his people theJews, and no doubt kept to the true religion. He did not seek his ownwealth, but the welfare of his people. Few have it in their power to doso much good as Mordecai; but all have it in their power to do hurt,and who has it not in his power to do some good? We are not required todo what is not in our power, or is unsuited to our station; but all arebound to live under the influence of the tempers displayed in thesaints, whose examples are recorded in the Bible. If we live by thefaith of Christ, we shall be active according to the ability andopportunities he gives us, in promoting his glory and the bestinterests of men. If our faith be genuine, it will work by love. Waitin faith and prayer, and the event will be safe and glorious; oursalvation is sure, through our Lord Jesus Christ.

As God is so great and glorious, how can man, who isguilty and impure, appear before him? We need to be born again of waterand of the Holy Ghost, and to be bathed again and again in the blood ofChrist, that Fountain opened, Zec 13:1. We should be humbled as mean,guilty, polluted creatures, and renounce self-dependence. But ourvileness will commend Christ's condescension and love; the riches ofhis mercy and the power of his grace will be magnified to all eternityby every sinner he redeems.

Job 39:	<b>Overview</b><br>God inquires of Job concerning several animals.<br>--In these questions the Lord continued to humble Job. In this chapterseveral animals are spoken of, whose nature or situation particularlyshow the power, wisdom, and manifold works of God. The wild ass. It isbetter to labour and be good for something, than to ramble and be goodfor nothing. From the untameableness of this and other creatures, wemay see, how unfit we are to give law to Providence, who cannot givelaw even to a wild ass's colt. The unicorn, a strong, stately, proudcreature. He is able to serve, but not willing; and God challenges Jobto force him to it. It is a great mercy if, where God gives strengthfor service, he gives a heart; it is what we should pray for, andreason ourselves into, which the brutes cannot do. Those gifts are notalways the most valuable that make the finest show. Who would notrather have the voice of the nightingale, than the tail of the peacock;the eye of the eagle and her soaring wing, and the natural affection ofthe stork, than the beautiful feathers of the ostrich, which can neverrise above the earth, and is without natural affection? The descriptionof the war-horse helps to explain the character of presumptuoussinners. Every one turneth to his course, as the horse rushes into thebattle. When a man's heart is fully set in him to do evil, and he iscarried on in a wicked way, by the violence of his appetites andpassions, there is no making him fear the wrath of God, and the fatalconsequences of sin. Secure sinners think themselves as safe in theirsins as the eagle in her nest on high, in the clefts of the rocks; butI will bring thee down from thence, saith the Lord, Jer 49:16. Allthese beautiful references to the works of nature, should teach us aright view of the riches of the wisdom of Him who made and sustains allthings. The want of right views concerning the wisdom of God, which isever present in all things, led Job to think and speak unworthily ofProvidence.
Job 40:	<b>Overview</b><br>Job humbles himself to God.	(1-5)<br>The Lord reasons with Job to show his righteousness, power, and wisdom.	(6-14)<br>God's power shown in Behemoth.	(15-24)
Job 41:	<b>Overview</b><br>Concerning Leviathan.<br>--The description of the Leviathan, is yet further to convince Job ofhis own weakness, and of God's almighty power. Whether this Leviathanbe a whale or a crocodile, is disputed. The Lord, having showed Job howunable he was to deal with the Leviathan, sets forth his own power inthat mighty creature. If such language describes the terrible force ofLeviathan, what words can express the power of God's wrath? Under ahumbling sense of our own vileness, let us revere the Divine Majesty;take and fill our allotted place, cease from our own wisdom, and giveall glory to our gracious God and Saviour. Remembering from whom everygood gift cometh, and for what end it was given, let us walk humblywith the Lord.

Psa 11:	<b>Overview</b><br>David's struggle with, and triumph over a strong temptation to distrustGod, and betake himself to indirect means for his own safety, in a timeof danger.<br>--Those that truly fear God and serve him, are welcome to put theirtrust in him. The psalmist, before he gives an account of histemptation to distrust God, records his resolution to trust in Him, asthat by which he was resolved to live and die. The believer, though notterrified by his enemies, may be tempted, by the fears of his friends,to desert his post, or neglect his work. They perceive his danger, butnot his security; they give him counsel that savours of worldly policy,rather than of heavenly wisdom. The principles of religion are thefoundations on which the faith and hope of the righteous are built. Weare concerned to hold these fast against all temptations to unbelief;for believers would be undone, if they had not God to go to, God totrust in, and future bliss to hope for. The prosperity of wicked peoplein their wicked, evil ways, and the straits and distresses which thebest men are sometimes brought into, tried David's faith. We need notsay, Who shall go up to heaven, to fetch us thence a God to trust in?The word is nigh us, and God in the word; his Spirit is in his saints,those living temples, and the Lord is that Spirit. This God governs theworld. We may know what men seem to be, but God knows what they are, asthe refiner knows the value of gold when he has tried it. God is saidto try with his eyes, because he cannot err, or be imposed upon. If heafflicts good people, it is for their trial, therefore for their good.However persecutors and oppressors may prosper awhile, they will forever perish. God is a holy God, and therefore hates them. He is arighteous Judge, and will therefore punish them. In what a horribletempest are the wicked hurried away at death! Every man has the portionof his cup assigned him. Impenitent sinner, mark your doom! The lastcall to repentance is about to be addressed to you, judgement is athand; through the gloomy shade of death you pass into the region ofeternal wrath. Hasten then, O sinner, to the cross of Christ. Howstands the case between God and our souls? Is Christ our hope, ourconsolation, our security? Then, not otherwise, will the soul becarried through all its difficulties and conflicts.
Psa 12:	<b>Overview</b><br>The psalmist begs help of God, because there were none among men whomhe durst trust.<br>--This psalm furnishes good thoughts for bad times; a man may comforthimself with such meditations and prayers. Let us see what makes thetimes bad, and when they may be said to be so. Ask the children of thisworld, What makes the times bad? they will tell you, Scarcity of money,decay of trade, and the desolations of war, make the times bad: but theScripture lays the badness of the times on causes of another nature,2Ti 3:1, &c.: perilous times shall come, for sin shall abound; and ofthis David complains. When piety decays times really are bad. He whomade man's mouth will call him to an account for his proud, profane,dissembling, or even useless words. When the poor and needy areoppressed, then the times are very bad. God himself takes notice of theoppression of the poor, and the sighing of the needy. When wickednessabounds, and is countenanced by those in authority, then the times arevery bad. See with what good things we are here furnished for such badtimes; and we cannot tell what times we may be reserved for. 1. We havea God to go to, from whom we may ask and expect the redress of all ourgrievances. 2. God will certainly punish and restrain false and proudmen. 3. God will work deliverance for his oppressed people. His help isgiven in the fittest time. Though men are false, God is faithful;though they are not to be trusted, God is. The preciousness of God'sword is compared to silver refined to the highest degree. How manyproofs have been given of its power and truth! God will secure hischosen remnant, however bad the times are. As long as the world stands,there will be a generation of proud and wicked men. But all God'speople are put into the hands of Christ our Saviour; there they are insafety, for none can pluck them thence; being built on Him, the Rock,they are safe, notwithstanding temptation or persecution come with everso much force upon them.
Psa 13:	<b>Overview</b><br>The psalmist complains that God had long withdrawn. He earnestly praysfor comfort. He assures himself of an answer of peace.<br>--God sometimes hides his face, and leaves his own children in the darkconcerning their interest in him: and this they lay to heart more thanany outward trouble whatever. But anxious cares are heavy burdens withwhich believers often load themselves more than they need. The bread ofsorrows is sometimes the saint's daily bread; our Master himself was aman of sorrows. It is a common temptation, when trouble lasts long, tothink that it will last always. Those who have long been without joy,begin to be without hope. We should never allow ourselves to make anycomplaints but what drive us to our knees. Nothing is more killing to asoul than the want of God's favour; nothing more reviving than thereturn of it. The sudden, delightful changes in the book of Psalms, areoften very remarkable. We pass from depth of despondency to the heightof religious confidence and joy. It is thus, ver. 5. All is gloomydejection in ver. 4; but here the mind of the despondent worshipperrises above all its distressing fears, and throws itself, withoutreserve, on the mercy and care of its Divine Redeemer. See the power offaith, and how good it is to draw near to God. If we bring our caresand griefs to the throne of grace, and leave them there, we may go awaylike Hannah, and our countenances will be no more said, 1Sa 1:18. God'smercy is the support of the psalmist's faith. Finding I have that totrust to, I am comforted, though I have no merit of my own. His faithin God's mercy filled his heart with joy in his salvation; for joy andpeace come by believing. He has dealt bountifully with me. By faith hewas as confident of salvation, as if it had been completed already. Inthis way believers pour out their prayers, renouncing all hopes but inthe mercy of God through the Saviour's blood: and sometimes suddenly,at others gradually, they will find their burdens removed, and theircomforts restored; they then allow that their fears and complaints wereunnecessary, and acknowledge that the Lord hath dealt bountifully withthem.
Psa 14:	<b>Overview</b><br>A description of the depravity of human nature, and the deplorablecorruption of a great part of mankind.<br>--The fool hath said in his heart, There is no God. The sinner heredescribed is an atheist, one that saith there is no Judge or Governorof the world, no Providence ruling over the affairs of men. He saysthis in his heart. He cannot satisfy himself that there is none, butwishes there were none, and pleases himself that it is possible theremay be none; he is willing to think there is none. This sinner is afool; he is simple and unwise, and this is evidence of it: he is wickedand profane, and this is the cause. The word of God is a discerner ofthese thoughts. No man will say, There is no God, till he is sohardened in sin, that it is become his interest that there should benone to call him to an account. The disease of sin has infected thewhole race of mankind. They are all gone aside, there is none thatdoeth good, no, not one. Whatever good is in any of the children ofmen, or is done by them, it is not of themselves, it is God's work inthem. They are gone aside from the right way of their duty, the waythat leads to happiness, and are turned into the paths of thedestroyer. Let us lament the corruption of our nature, and see whatneed we have of the grace of God: let us not marvel that we are told wemust be born again. And we must not rest in any thing short of unionwith Christ, and a new creation to holiness by his Spirit. The psalmistendeavours to convince sinners of the evil and danger of their way,while they think themselves very wise, and good, and safe. Theirwickedness is described. Those that care not for God's people, forGod's poor, care not for God himself. People run into all manner ofwickedness, because they do not call upon God for his grace. What goodcan be expected from those that live without prayer? But those thatwill not fear God, may be made to fear at the shaking of a leaf. Allour knowledge of the depravity of human nature should endear to ussalvation out of Zion. But in heaven alone shall the whole company ofthe redeemed rejoice fully, and for evermore. The world is bad; oh thatthe Messiah would come and change its character! There is universalcorruption; oh for the times of reformation! The triumphs of Zion'sKing will be the joys of Zion's children. The second coming of Christ,finally to do away the dominion of sin and Satan, will be thecompleting of this salvation, which is the hope, and will be the joy ofevery Israelite indeed. With this assurance we should comfort ourselvesand one another, under the sins of sinners and sufferings of saints.
Psa 15:	<b>Overview</b><br>The way to heaven, if we would be happy, we must be holy. We areencouraged to walk in that way.<br>--Here is a very serious question concerning the character of a citizenof Zion. It is the happiness of glorified saints, that they dwell inthe holy hill; they are at home there, they shall be for ever there. Itconcerns us to make it sure to ourselves that we have a place amongthem. A very plain and particular answer is here given. Those whodesire to know their duty, will find the Scripture a very faithfuldirector, and conscience a faithful monitor. A citizen of Zion issincere in his religion. He is really what he professes to be, andendeavours to stand complete in all the will of God. He is just both toGod and man; and, in speaking to both, speaks the truth in his heart.He scorns and abhors wrong and fraud; he cannot reckon that a goodbargain, nor a saving one, which is made with a lie; and knows that hewho wrongs his neighbour will prove, in the end, to have most injuredhimself. He is very careful to do hurt to no man. He speaks evil of noman, makes not others' faults the matter of his common talk; he makesthe best of every body, and the worst of nobody. If an ill-naturedstory be told him, he will disprove it if he can; if not, it goes nofurther. He values men by their virtue and piety. Wicked people arevile people, worthless, and good for nothing; so the word signifies. Hethinks the worse of no man's piety for his poverty and mean condition.He reckons that serious piety puts honour upon a man, more than wealth,or a great name. He honours such, desires their conversation and aninterest in their prayers, is glad to show them respect, or do them akindness. By this we may judge of ourselves in some measure. Even wiseand good men may swear to their own hurt: but see how strong theobligation is, a man must rather suffer loss to himself and his family,than wrong his neighbour. He will not increase his estate by extortion,or by bribery. He will not, for any gain, or hope of it to himself, doany thing to hurt a righteous cause. Every true living member of thechurch, like the church itself, is built upon a Rock. He that doeththese things shall not be moved for ever. The grace of God shall alwaysbe sufficient for him. The union of these tempers and this conduct, canonly spring from repentance for sin, faith in the Saviour, and love tohim. In these respects let us examine and prove our own selves.
Psa 16:	<b>Overview</b><br>This psalm begins with expressions of devotion, which may be applied toChrist; but ends with such confidence of a resurrection, as must beapplied to Christ, and to him only.<br>--David flees to God's protection, with cheerful, believing confidence.Those who have avowed that the Lord is their Lord, should often putthemselves in mind of what they have done, take the comfort of it, andlive up to it. He devotes himself to the honour of God, in the serviceof the saints. Saints on earth we must be, or we shall never be saintsin heaven. Those renewed by the grace of God, and devoted to the gloryof God, are saints on earth. The saints in the earth are excellentones, yet some of them so poor, that they needed to have David'sgoodness extended to them. David declares his resolution to have nofellowship with the works of darkness; he repeats the solemn choice hehad made of God for his portion and happiness, takes to himself thecomfort of the choice, and gives God the glory of it. This is thelanguage of a devout and pious soul. Most take the world for theirchief good, and place their happiness in the enjoyments of it; but howpoor soever my condition is in this world, let me have the love andfavour of God, and be accepted of him; let me have a title by promiseto life and happiness in the future state; and I have enough. Heaven isan inheritance; we must take that for our home, our rest, oureverlasting good, and look upon this world to be no more ours, than thecountry through which is our road to our Father's house. Those thathave God for their portion, have a goodly heritage. Return unto thyrest, O my soul, and look no further. Gracious persons, though theystill covet more of God, never covet more than God; but, beingsatisfied of his loving-kindness, are abundantly satisfied with it:they envy not any their carnal mirth and delights. But so ignorant andfoolish are we, that if left to ourselves, we shall forsake our ownmercies for lying vanities. God having given David counsel by his wordand Spirit, his own thoughts taught him in the night season, andengaged him by faith to live to God. Verses #(8-11), are quoted by St.Peter in his first sermon, after the pouring out of the Spirit on theday of Pentecost, Ac 2:25-31; he declared that David in them speaksconcerning Christ, and particularly of his resurrection. And Christbeing the Head of the body, the church, these verses may be applied toall Christians, guided and animated by the Spirit of Christ; and we mayhence learn, that it is our wisdom and duty to set the Lord alwaysbefore us. And if our eyes are ever toward God, our hearts and tonguesmay ever rejoice in him. Death destroys the hope of man, but not thehope of a real Christian. Christ's resurrection is an earnest of thebeliever's resurrection. In this world sorrow is our lot, but in heaventhere is joy, a fulness of joy; our pleasures here are for a moment,but those at God's right hand are pleasures for evermore. Through thisthy beloved Son, and our dear Saviour, thou wilt show us, O Lord, thepath of life; thou wilt justify our souls now, and raise our bodies bythy power at the last day; when earthly sorrow shall end in heavenlyjoy, pain in everlasting happiness.

Psa 20:	<b>Overview</b><br>This psalm is a prayer for the kings of Israel, but with relation toChrist.<br>--Even the greatest of men may be much in trouble. Neither the crown onthe king's head, nor the grace in his heart, would make him free fromtrouble. Even the greatest of men must be much in prayer. Let noneexpect benefit by the prayers of the church, or their friends, who arecapable of praying for themselves, yet neglect it. Pray that God wouldprotect his person, and preserve his life. That God would enable him togo on in his undertakings for the public good. We may know that Godaccepts our spiritual sacrifices, if by his Spirit he kindles in oursouls a holy fire of piety and love to God. Also, that the Lord wouldcrown his enterprises with success. Our first step to victory inspiritual warfare is to trust only in the mercy and grace of God; allwho trust in themselves will soon be cast down. Believers triumph inGod, and his revelation of himself to them, by which they distinguishthemselves from those that live without God in the world. Those whomake God and his name their praise, may make God and his name theirtrust. This was the case when the pride and power of Jewish unbelief,and pagan idolatry, fell before the sermons and lives of the humblebelievers in Jesus. This is the case in every conflict with ourspiritual enemies, when we engage them in the name, the spirit, and thepower of Christ; and this will be the case at the last day, when theworld, with the prince of it, shall be brought down and fall; butbelievers, risen-from the dead, through the resurrection of the Lord,shall stand, and sing his praises in heaven. In Christ's salvation letus rejoice; and set up our banners in the name of the Lord our God,assured that by the saving strength of his right hand we shall beconquerors over every enemy.

Psa 23:	<b>Overview</b><br>Confidence in God's grace and care.<br>--"The Lord is my shepherd." In these words, the believer is taught toexpress his satisfaction in the care of the great Pastor of theuniverse, the Redeemer and Preserver of men. With joy he reflects thathe has a shepherd, and that shepherd is Jehovah. A flock of sheep,gentle and harmless, feeding in verdant pastures, under the care of askilful, watchful, and tender shepherd, forms an emblem of believersbrought back to the Shepherd of their souls. The greatest abundance isbut a dry pasture to a wicked man, who relishes in it only what pleasesthe senses; but to a godly man, who by faith tastes the goodness of Godin all his enjoyments, though he has but little of the world, it is agreen pasture. The Lord gives quiet and contentment in the mind,whatever the lot is. Are we blessed with the green pastures of theordinances, let us not think it enough to pass through them, but let usabide in them. The consolations of the Holy Spirit are the still watersby which the saints are led; the streams which flow from the Fountainof living waters. Those only are led by the still waters of comfort,who walk in the paths of righteousness. The way of duty is the trulypleasant way. The work of righteousness in peace. In these paths wecannot walk, unless. God lead us into them, and lead us on in them.Discontent and distrust proceed from unbelief; an unsteady walk is theconsequence: let us then simply trust our Shepherd's care, and hearkento his voice. The valley of the shadow of death may denote the mostsevere and terrible affliction, or dark dispensation of providence,that the psalmist ever could come under. Between the part of the flockon earth and that which is gone to heaven, death lies like a darkvalley that must be passed in going from one to the other. But even inthis there are words which lessen the terror. It is but the shadow ofdeath: the shadow of a serpent will not sting, nor the shadow of asword kill. It is a valley, deep indeed, and dark, and miry; butvalleys are often fruitful, and so is death itself fruitful of comfortsto God's people. It is a walk through it: they shall not be lost inthis valley, but get safe to the mountain on the other side. Death is aking of terrors, but not to the sheep of Christ. When they come to die,God will rebuke the enemy; he will guide them with his rod, and sustainthem with his staff. There is enough in the gospel to comfort thesaints when dying, and underneath them are the everlasting arms. TheLord's people feast at his table, upon the provisions of his love.Satan and wicked men are not able to destroy their comforts, while theyare anointed with the Holy Spirit, and drink of the cup of salvationwhich is ever full. Past experience teaches believers to trust that thegoodness and mercy of God will follow them all the days of their lives,and it is their desire and determination, to seek their happiness inthe service of God here, and they hope to enjoy his love for ever inheaven. While here, the Lord can make any situation pleasant, by theanointing of his Spirit and the joys of his salvation. But those thatwould be satisfied with the blessings of his house, must keep close tothe duties of it.

Psa 26:	<b>Overview</b><br>David, in this psalm, appeals to God touching his integrity.<br>--David here, by the Spirit of prophecy, speaks of himself as a type ofChrist, of whom what he here says of his spotless innocence was fullyand eminently true, and of Christ only, and to Him we may apply it. Weare complete in him. The man that walks in his integrity, yet trustingwholly in the grace of God, is in a state of acceptance, according tothe covenant of which Jesus was the Mediator, in virtue of his spotlessobedience even unto death. This man desires to have his inmost soulsearched and proved by the Lord. He is aware of the deceitfulness ofhis own heart; he desires to detect and mortify every sin; and he longsto be satisfied of his being a true believer, and to practise the holycommands of God. Great care to avoid bad company, is both a goodevidence of our integrity, and a good means to keep us in it.Hypocrites and dissemblers may be found attending on God's ordinances;but it is a good sign of sincerity, if we attend upon them, as thepsalmist here tells us he did, in the exercise of repentance andconscientious obedience. He feels his ground firm under him; and, as hedelights in blessing the Lord with his congregations on earth, hetrusts that shortly he shall join the great assembly in heaven, insinging praises to God and to the Lamb for evermore.

Psa 28:	<b>Overview</b><br>A prayer in distress.	(1-5)<br>Thanksgiving for deliverance.	(6-9)
Psa 29:	<b>Overview</b><br>Exhortation to give glory to God.<br>--The mighty and honourable of the earth are especially bound to honourand worship him; but, alas, few attempt to worship him in the beauty ofholiness. When we come before him as the Redeemer of sinners, inrepentance faith, and love, he will accept our defective services,pardon the sin that cleaves to them, and approve of that measure ofholiness which the Holy Spirit enables us to exercise. We have here thenature of religious worship; it is giving to the Lord the glory due tohis name. We must be holy in all our religious services, devoted toGod, and to his will and glory. There is a beauty in holiness, and thatputs beauty upon all acts of worship. The psalmist here sets forthGod's dominion in the kingdom of nature. In the thunder, and lightning,and storm, we may see and hear his glory. Let our hearts be therebyfilled with great, and high, and honourable thoughts of God, in theholy adoring of whom, the power of godliness so much consists. O Lordour God, thou art very great! The power of the lightning equals theterror of the thunder. The fear caused by these effects of the Divinepower, should remind us of the mighty power of God, of man's weakness,and of the defenceless and desperate condition of the wicked in the dayof judgment. But the effects of the Divine word upon the souls of men,under the power of the Holy Spirit, are far greater than those ofthunder storms in the nature world. Thereby the stoutest are made totremble, the proudest are cast down, the secrets of the heart arebrought to light, sinners are converted, the savage, sensual, andunclean, become harmless, gentle, and pure. If we have heard God'svoice, and have fled for refuge to the hope set before us, let usremember that children need not fear their Father's voice, when hespeaks in anger to his enemies. While those tremble who are withoutshelter, let those who abide in his appointed refuge bless him fortheir security, looking forward to the day of judgment without dismay,safe as Noah in the ark.

If we cannot comfort ourselves inGod, we may stay ourselves upon him, and may have spiritual supports,when we want spiritual delights. He never cast off any that trusted inhim, whatever fears they may have had of their own state. We needdesire no more to make us happy, than the good that flow from God'sfavour, and is included in his promise. Those whom God leads, he leadsto his holy hill; those, therefore, who pretend to be led by theSpirit, and yet turn their backs upon ordinance, deceive themselves. Weare still to pray for the Spirit of light and truth, who supplies thewant of Christ's bodily presence, to guide us in the way to heaven.Whatever we rejoice or triumph in, the Lord must be the joy of it.David applies to God as his never-failing hope. Let us pray earnestly,that the Lord would send forth the truth of his word, and the light ofhis Spirit, to guide us into the way of holiness, peace, and salvation.The desire of the Christian, like that of the prophet in distress, isto be saved from sin as well as sorrow; to be taught in the way ofrighteousness by the light of heavenly wisdom, shining in Jesus Christ,and to be led by this light and truth to the New Jerusalem.

Psa 53:	<b>Overview</b><br>The corruption of man by nature.<br>--This psalm is almost the same as the 14th. The scope of it is toconvince us of our sins. God, by the psalmist, here shows us how bad weare, and proves this by his own certain knowledge. He speaks terror topersecutors, the worst of sinners. He speaks encouragement to God'spersecuted people. How comes it that men are so bad? Because there isno fear of God before their eyes. Men's bad practices flow from theirbad principles; if they profess to know God, yet in works, because inthoughts, they deny him. See the folly of sin; he is a fool, in theaccount of God, whose judgment we are sure is right, that harbours suchcorrupt thoughts. And see the fruit of sin; to what it brings men, whentheir hearts are hardened through the deceitfulness of sin. See alsothe faith of the saints, and their hope and power as to the cure ofthis great evil. There will come a Saviour, a great salvation, asalvation from sin. God will save his church from its enemies. He willsave all believers from their own sins, that they may not be ledcaptive by them, which will be everlasting joy to them. From this workthe Redeemer had his name JESUS, for he shall save his people fromtheir sins, Mt 1:21.

Psa 67:	<b>Overview</b><br>A prayer for the enlargement of Christ's kingdom.<br>--All our happiness comes from God's mercy; therefore the first thingprayed for is, God be merciful to us, to us sinners, and pardon oursins. Pardon is conveyed by God's blessing, and secured in that. If we,by faith, walk with God, we may hope that his face will shine on us.The psalmist passes on to a prayer for the conversion of the Gentiles,which shows that the Old Testament saints desired that their advantagesmight also be enjoyed by others. And many Scripture prophecies andpromises are wrapped up in prayers: the answer to the prayer of thechurch is as sure as the performance of God's promises. The joy wishedto the nations, is holy joy. Let them be glad that by his providencethe Lord will overrule the affairs of kingdoms; that even the kingdomsof this world shall became the kingdom of the Lord, and of his Christ.Then is declared a joyful prospect of all good when God shall do this.The success of the gospel brings outward mercies with it; righteousnessexalts a nation. The blessing of the Lord sweetens all ourcreature-comforts to us, and makes them comforts indeed. All the worldshall be brought to worship Him. When the gospel begins to spread, itshall go forward more and more, till it reaches to the ends of theearth. It is good to cast in our lot with those that are the blessed ofthe Lord. If nothing had been spoken in Scripture respecting theconversion of the heathen, we might think it vain to attempt sohopeless a work. But when we see with what confidence it is declared inthe Scriptures, we may engage in missionary labours, assured that Godwill fulfil his own word. And shall we be backward to make known to theheathen the knowledge with which we are favoured, and the salvation weprofess to glory in? They cannot learn unless they are taught. Then letus go forward in the strength of the Lord, and look to him to accompanythe word the Holy Ghost; then Satan's kingdom shall be destroyed, andthe kingdom of our Redeemer established.

Psa 70:	<b>Overview</b><br>The speedy destruction of the wicked, and the preservation of thegodly.<br>--This psalm is almost the same as the last five verses of Ps 40.

Let us apply these things to ourown troubled circumstances, and in a believing manner bring them, andthe sinful causes thereof, to our remembrance. Urgent trials shouldalways awake fervent prayers.

Solomon was both the king and the king's son, and his piousfather desired that the wisdom of God might be in him, that his reignmight be a remembrance of the kingdom of the Messiah. It is the prayerof a father for his child; a dying blessing. The best we can ask of Godfor our children is, that God would give them wisdom and grace to knowand to do their duty.

Psa 100:	<b>Overview</b><br>An exhortation to praise God, and rejoice in him.<br>--This song of praise should be considered as a prophecy, and even usedas a prayer, for the coming of that time when all people shall knowthat the Lord he is God, and shall become his worshippers, and thesheep of his pasture. Great encouragement is given us, in worshippingGod, to do it cheerfully. If, when we strayed like wandering sheep, hehas brought us again to his fold, we have indeed abundant cause tobless his name. The matter of praise, and the motives to it, are veryimportant. Know ye what God is in himself, and what he is to you. Knowit; consider and apply it, then you will be more close and constant,more inward and serious, in his worship. The covenant of grace set downin the Scriptures of the Old and New Testament, with so many richpromises, to strengthen the faith of every weak believer, makes thematter of God's praise and of his people's joys so sure, that how sadsoever our spirits may be when we look to ourselves, yet we shall havereason to praise the Lord when we look to his goodness and mercy, andto what he has said in his word for our comfort.
Psa 101:	<b>Overview</b><br>David's vow and profession of godliness.<br>--In this psalm we have David declaring how he intended to regulate hishousehold, and to govern his kingdom, that he might stop wickedness,and encourage godliness. It is also applicable to private families, andis the householder's psalm. It teaches all that have any power, whethermore or less, to use it so as to be a terror to evil-doers, and apraise to them that do well. The chosen subject of the psalm is God'smercy and judgment. The Lord's providences concerning his people arecommonly mixed; mercy and judgment. God has set the one over againstthe other, both to do good, like showers and sunshine. When, in hisprovidence, he exercises us with the mixture of mercy and judgment, wemust make suitable acknowledgments to him for both. Family mercies andfamily afflictions are both calls to family religion. Those who are inpublic stations are not thereby excused from care in governing theirfamilies; they are the more concerned to set a good example of rulingtheir own houses well. Whenever a man has a house of his own, let himseek to have God to dwell with him; and those may expect his presence,who walk with a perfect heart, in a perfect way. David resolves topractise no evil himself. He further resolves not to keep bad servants,nor to employ those about him that are wicked. He will not admit theminto his family, lest they spread the infection of sin. A frowardheart, one that delights to be cross and perverse, is not fit forsociety, the bond of which is Christian love. Nor will he countenanceslanderers, those who take pleasure in wounding their neighbour'sreputation. Also, God resists the proud, and false, deceitful people,who scruple not to tell lies, or commit frauds. Let every one bezealous and diligent to reform his own heart and ways, and to do thisearly; ever mindful of that future, most awful morning, when the Kingof righteousness shall cut off all wicked doers from the heavenlyJerusalem.

Every gift of the Lord honours and profits thepossessor, as it is employed in God's service and to his glory.Believers may pray with assured faith and hope, for all the blessingsof salvation; which are secured to them by the faithful promise andcovenant of God. Then let them expect from him help in every trouble,and victory in every conflict. Whatever we do, whatever we gain, Godmust have all the glory. Lord, visit all our souls with this salvation,with this favour which thou bearest to thy chosen people.

Psa 110:	<b>Overview</b><br>Christ's kingdom.<br>--Glorious things are here spoken of Christ. Not only he should besuperior to all the kings of the earth, but he then existed in glory asthe eternal Son of God. Sitting is a resting posture: after servicesand sufferings, to give law, to give judgment. It is a remainingposture: he sits like a king for ever. All his enemies are now in achain, but not yet made his footstool. And his kingdom, being set up,shall be kept up in the world, in despite of all the powers ofdarkness. Christ's people are a willing people. The power of theSpirit, going with the power of the world, to the people of Christs, iseffectual to make them willing. They shall attend him in the beautifulattire of holiness; which becomes his house for ever. And he shall havemany devoted to him. The dew of our youth, even in the morning of ourdays, ought to be consecrated to our Lord Jesus. Christ shall not onlybe a King, but a Priest. He is God's Minister to us, and our Advocatewith the Father, and so is the Mediator between God and man. He is aPriest of the order of Melchizedek, which was before that of Aaron, andon many accounts superior to it, and a more lively representation ofChrist's priesthood. Christ's sitting at the right hand of God, speaksas much terror to his enemies as happiness to his people. The effect ofthis victory shall be the utter ruin of his enemies. We have here theRedeemer saving his friends, and comforting them. He shall be humbled;he shall drink of the brook in the way. The wrath of God, running inthe curse of the law, may be considered as the brook in the way of hisundertaking. Christ drank of the waters of affliction in his way to thethrone of glory. But he shall be exalted. What then are we? Has thegospel of Christ been to us the power of God unto salvation? Has hiskingdom been set up in our hearts? Are we his willing subjects? Once weknew not our need of his salvation, and we were not willing that heshould reign over us. Are we willing to give up every sin, to turn froma wicked, insnaring world, and rely only on his merits and mercy, tohave him for our Prophet, Priest, and King? and do we desire to beholy? To those who are thus changed, the Saviour's sacrifice,intercession, and blessing belong.
Psa 111:	<b>Overview</b><br>The Lord is to be praised for his works.<br>--The psalmist resolves to praise God himself. Our exhortations and ourexamples should agree together. He recommends the works of the Lord, asthe proper subject, when we are praising him; and the dealings of hisprovidence toward the world, the church, and particular persons. Allthe works of the Lord are spoken of as one, it is his work; soadmirably do all the dispensations of his providence centre in onedesign. The works of God, humbly and diligently sought into, shall allbe found just and holy. God's pardoning sin is the most wonderful ofall his works, and ought to be remembered to his glory. He will ever bemindful of his covenant; he has ever been so, and he ever will be so.His works of providence were done according to the truth of the Divinepromises and prophecies, and so were verity, or truth; and by him whohas a right to dispose of the earth as he pleases, and so are judgment,or righteous: and this holds good of the work of grace upon the heartof man, 
Psa 112:	<b>Overview</b><br>The blessedness of the righteous.<br>--We have to praise the Lord that there are a people in the world, whofear him and serve him, and that they are a happy people; which isowing entirely to his grace. Their fear is not that which love castsout, but that which love brings in. It follows and flows from love. Itis a fear to offend. This is both fear and trust. The heart touched bythe Spirit of God, as the needle touched with the loadstone, turnsdirect and speedily to God, yet still with trembling, being filled withthis holy fear. Blessings are laid up for the faithful and theirchildren's children; and true riches are bestowed on them, with as muchof this world's possessions as is profitable for them. In the darkesthours of affliction and trial, the light of hope and peace will springup within them, and seasonable relief shall turn mourning into joy.From their Lord's example they learn to be kind and full of compassion,as well as just in all their dealings; they use discretion, that theymay be liberal in that manner which appears most likely to do good.Envy and slander may for a time hide their true characters here, butthey shall be had in everlasting remembrance. They need not fear eviltidings. A good man shall have a settled spirit. And it is theendeavour of true believers to keep their minds stayed upon God, and soto keep them calm and undisturbed; and God has promised them both causeto do so, and grace to do so. Trusting in the Lord is the best andsurest way of establishing the heart. The heart of man cannot fix anywhere with satisfaction, but in the truth of God, and there it findsfirm footing. And those whose hearts are established by faith, willpatiently wait till they gain their point. Compare all this with thevexation of sinners. The happiness of the saints is the envy of thewicked. The desire of the wicked shall perish; their desire was whollyto the world and the flesh, therefore when these perish, their joy isgone. But the blessings of the gospel are spiritual and eternal, andare conferred upon the members of the Christian church, through Christtheir Head, who is the Pattern of all righteousness, and the Giver ofall grace.
Psa 113:	<b>Overview</b><br>An exhortation to praise God.<br>--God has praise from his own people. They have most reason to praisehim; for those who attend him as his servants, know him best, andreceive most of his favours, and it is easy, pleasant work to speakwell of their Master. God's name ought to be praised in every place,from east to west. Within this wide space the Lord's name is to bepraised; it ought to be so, though it is not. Ere long it will be, whenall nations shall come and worship before him. God is exalted above allblessing and praise. We must therefore say, with holy admiration, Whois like unto the Lord our God? How condescending in him to behold thethings in the earth! And what amazing condescension was it for the Sonof God to come from heaven to earth, and take our nature upon him, thathe might seek and save those that were lost! How vast his love intaking upon him the nature of man, to ransom guilty souls! Godsometimes makes glorious his own wisdom and power, when, having somegreat work to do, he employs those least likely, and least thought offor it by themselves or others. The apostles were sent from fishing tobe fishers of men. And this is God's constant method in his kingdom ofgrace. He takes men, by nature beggars, and even traitors, to be hisfavourites, his children, kings and priests unto him; and numbers themwith the princes of his chosen people. He gives us all our comforts,which are generally the more welcome when long delayed, and no longerexpected. Let us pray that those lands which are yet barren, mayspeedily become fruitful, and produce many converts to join in praisingthe Lord.
Psa 114:	<b>Overview</b><br>An exhortation to fear God.<br>--Let us acknowledge God's power and goodness in what he did forIsrael, applying it to that much greater work of wonder, our redemptionby Christ; and encourage ourselves and others to trust in God in thegreatest straits. When Christ comes for the salvation of his people ,he redeems them from the power of sin and Satan, separates them from anungodly world, forms them to be his people, and becomes their King.There is no sea, no Jordan, so deep, so broad, but, when God's time iscome, it shall be divided and driven back. Apply this to the plantingthe Christian church in the world. What ailed Satan and his idolatries,that they trembled as they did? But especially apply it to the work ofgrace in the heart. What turns the stream in a regenerate soul? Whataffects the lusts and corruptions, that they fly back; that prejudicesare removed, and the whole man becomes new? It is at the presence ofGod's Spirit. At the presence of the Lord, not only mountains, but theearth itself may well tremble, since it has lain under a curse forman's sin. As the Israelites were protected, so they were provided forby miracles; such was that fountain of waters into which the flintyrock was turned, and that rock was Christ. The Son of God, the Rock ofages, gave himself to death, to open a fountain to wash away sins, andto supply believers with waters of life and consolation; and they neednot fear that any blessing is too great to expect from his love. Butlet sinners fear before their just and holy Judge. Let us now prepareto meet our God, that we may have boldness before him at his coming.

Psa 117:	<b>Overview</b><br>All people called upon to praise God.<br>--Here is a solemn call to all nations to praise the Lord, and propermatter for that praise is suggested. We are soon weary of well-doing,if we keep not up the pious and devout affections with which thespiritual sacrifice of praise ought to be kindled and kept burning.This is a gospel psalm. The apostle, Ro 15:11, quotes it as a proofthat the gospel was to be preached to the Gentile nations, and that itwould be entertained by them. For many ages, in Judah only was Godknown, and his name praised; this call was not then given to anyGentiles. But the gospel of Christ is ordered to be preached to allnations, and by him those that were afar off are made nigh. We areamong the persons to whom the Holy Spirit here speaks, whom he callsupon to join his ancient people in praising the Lord. Grace has thusabounded to millions of perishing sinners. Let us then listen to theoffers of the grace of God, and pray for that time when all nations ofthe earth shall show forth his praises. And let us bless God for theunsearchable riches of gospel grace.

Psa 119:	<b>Overview</b><br>The general scope and design of this psalm is to magnify the Divinelaw, and make it honourable. There are ten words by which Divinerevelation is called in this psalm, and each expresses what God expectsfrom us, and what we may expect from him. 1. God's law; this is enactedby him as our Sovereign. 2. His way; this is the rule of hisprovidence. 3. His testimonies; they are solemnly declared to theworld. 4. His commandments; given with authority. 5. His precepts; notleft as indifferent matters to us. 6. His word, or saying; it is thedeclaration of his mind. 7. His judgments; framed in infinite wisdom.8. His righteousness; it is the rule and standard of what is right. 9.His statutes; they are always binding. 10. His truth or faithfulness;it is eternal truth, it shall endure for ever.

Psa 121:	<b>Overview</b><br>The safety of the godly.<br>--We must not rely upon men and means, instruments and second causes.Shall I depend upon the strength of the hills? upon princes and greatmen? No; my confidence is in God only. Or, we must lift up our eyesabove the hills; we must look to God who makes all earthly things to uswhat they are. We must see all our help in God; from him we must expectit, in his own way and time. This psalm teaches us to comfort ourselvesin the Lord, when difficulties and dangers are greatest. It is almightywisdom that contrives, and almighty power that works the safety ofthose that put themselves under God's protection. He is a wakeful,watchful Keeper; he is never weary; he not only does not sleep, but hedoes not so much as slumber. Under this shade they may sit with delightand assurance. He is always near his people for their protection andrefreshment. The right hand is the working hand; let them but turn totheir duty, and they shall find God ready to give them success. He willtake care that his people shall not fall. Thou shalt not be hurt,neither by the open assaults, nor by the secret attempts of thineenemies. The Lord shall prevent the evil thou fearest, and sanctify,remove, or lighten the evil thou feelest. He will preserve the soul,that it be not defiled by sin, and disturbed by affliction; he willpreserve it from perishing eternally. He will keep thee in life anddeath; going out to thy labour in the morning of thy days, and cominghome to thy rest when the evening of old age calls thee in. It is aprotection for life. The Spirit, who is their Preserver and Comforter,shall abide with them for ever. Let us be found in our work, assuredthat the blessings promised in this psalm are ours.
Psa 122:	<b>Overview</b><br>Esteem for Jerusalem.	(1-5)<br>Concern for its welfare.	(6-9)
Psa 123:	<b>Overview</b><br>Confidence in God under contempt.<br>--Our Lord Jesus has taught us to look unto God in prayer as our Fatherin heaven. In every prayer a good man lifts up his soul to God;especially when in trouble. We desire mercy from him; we hope he willshow us mercy, and we will continue waiting on him till it come. Theeyes of a servant are to his master's directing hand, expecting that hewill appoint him his work. And also to his supplying hand. Servantslook to their master or their mistress for their portion of meat in dueseason. And to God we must look for daily bread, for grace sufficient;from him we must receive it thankfully. Where can we look for help butto our Master? And, further, to his protecting hand. If the servant iswronged and injured in his work, who should right him, but his master?And to his correcting hand. Whither should sinners turn but to him thatsmote them? They humble themselves under God's mighty hand. And lastly,to his rewarding hand. Hypocrites look to the world's hand, thence theyhave their reward; but true Christians look to God as their Master andtheir Rewarder. God's people find little mercy with men; but this istheir comfort, that with the Lord there is mercy. Scorning and contempthave been, are, and are likely to be, the lot of God's people in thisworld. It is hard to bear; but the servants of God should not complainif they are treated as his beloved Son was. Let us then, when ready tofaint under trials, look unto Jesus, and by faith and prayer castourselves upon the mercy of God.

Psa 127:	<b>Overview</b><br>The value of the Divine blessing.<br>--Let us always look to God's providence. In all the affairs andbusiness of a family we must depend upon his blessing. 1. For raising afamily. If God be not acknowledged, we have no reason to expect hisblessing; and the best-laid plans fail, unless he crowns them withsuccess. 2. For the safety of a family or a city. Except the Lord keepthe city, the watchmen, though they neither slumber nor sleep, wake butin vain; mischief may break out, which even early discoveries may notbe able to prevent. 3. For enriching a family. Some are so eager uponthe world, that they are continually full of care, which makes theircomforts bitter, and their lives a burden. All this is to get money;but all in vain, except God prosper them: while those who love theLord, using due diligence in their lawful callings, and casting alltheir care upon him, have needful success, without uneasiness orvexation. Our care must be to keep ourselves in the love of God; thenwe may be easy, whether we have little or much of this world. But wemust use the proper means very diligently. Children are God's gifts, aheritage, and a reward; and are to be accounted blessings, and notburdens: he who sends mouths, will send meat, if we trust in him. Theyare a great support and defence to a family. Children who are young,may be directed aright to the mark, God's glory, and the service oftheir generation; but when they are gone into the world, they arearrows out of the hand, it is too late to direct them then. But thesearrows in the hand too often prove arrows in the heart, a grief togodly parents. Yet, if trained according to God's word, they generallyprove the best defence in declining years, remembering theirobligations to their parents, and taking care of them in old age. Allearthly comforts are uncertain, but the Lord will assuredly comfort andbless those who serve him; and those who seek the conversion ofsinners, will find that their spiritual children are their joy andcrown in the day of Jesus Christ.
Psa 128:	<b>Overview</b><br>The blessings of those who fear God.<br>--Only those who are truly holy, are truly happy. In vain do we pretendto be of those that fear God, if we do not make conscience of keepingstedfastly to his ways. Blessed is every one that fears the Lord;whether he be high or low, rich or poor in the world. If thou fear himand walk in his ways, all shall be well with thee while thou livest,better when thou diest, best of all in eternity. By the blessing ofGod, the godly shall get an honest livelihood. Here is a doublepromise; they shall have something to do, for an idle life is amiserable, uncomfortable life, and shall have health and strength, andpower of mind to do it. They shall not be forced to live upon thelabours of other people. It is as much a mercy as a duty, withquietness to work and eat our own bread. They and theirs shall enjoywhat they get. Such as fear the Lord and walk in his ways, are the onlyhappy persons, whatever their station in life may be. They shall haveabundant comfort in their family relations. And they shall have all thegood things God has promised, and which they pray for. A good man canhave little comfort in seeing his children's children, unless he seespeace upon Israel. Every true believer rejoices in the prosperity ofthe church. Hereafter we shall see greater things, with the everlastingpeace and rest that remain for the Israel of God.

Psa 131:	<b>Overview</b><br>The psalmist's humility. Believers encouraged to trust in God.<br>--The psalmist aimed at nothing high or great, but to be content inevery condition God allotted. Humble saints cannot think so well ofthemselves as others think of them. The love of God reigning in theheart, will subdue self-love. Where there is a proud heart, there iscommonly a proud look. To know God and our duty, is learningsufficiently high for us. It is our wisdom not to meddle with thatwhich does not belong to us. He was well reconciled to every conditionthe Lord placed him in. He had been as humble as a little child aboutthe age of weaning, and as far from aiming at high things; as entirelyat God's disposal, as the child at the disposal of the mother or nurse.We must become as little children, Mt 18:3. Our hearts are desirous ofworldly things, cry for them, and are fond of them; but, by the graceof God, a soul that is made holy, is weaned from these things. Thechild is cross and fretful while in the weaning; but in a day or two itcares no longer for milk, and it can bear stronger food. Thus does aconverted soul quiet itself under the loss of what it loved, anddisappointments in what it hoped for, and is easy whatever happens.When our condition is not to our mind, we must bring our mind to ourcondition; then we are easy to ourselves and all about us; then oursouls are as a weaned child. And thus the psalmist recommendsconfidence in God, to all the Israel of God, from his own experience.It is good to hope, and quietly to wait for the salvation of the Lordunder every trial.

Psa 133:	<b>Overview</b><br>The excellency of brotherly love.<br>--We cannot say too much, it were well if enough could be said, topersuade people to live together in peace. It is good for us, for ourhonour and comfort; and brings constant delight to those who live inunity. The pleasantness of this is likened to the holy anointing oil.This is the fruit of the Spirit, the proof of our union with Christ,and adorns his gospel. It is profitable as well as pleasing; it bringsblessings numerous as the drops of dew. It cools the scorching heat ofmen's passions, as the dews cool the air and refresh the earth. Itmoistens the heart, and makes it fit to receive the good seed of theword, and to make it fruitful. See the proof of the excellency ofbrotherly love: where brethren dwell together in unity, the Lordcommands the blessing. God commands the blessing; man can but beg ablessing. Believers that live in love and peace, shall have the God oflove and peace with them now, and they shall shortly be with him forever, in the world of endless love and peace. May all who love the Lordforbear and forgive one another, as God, for Christ's sake, hathforgiven them.
Psa 134:	<b>Overview</b><br>An exhortation to bless the Lord.<br>--We must stir up ourselves to give glory to God, and encourageourselves to hope for mercy and grace from him. It is an excellent planto fill up all our spare minutes with pious meditations, and prayersand praises. No time would then be a burden, nor should we murder ourhours by trifling conversation and vain amusements, or by carnalindulgences. We need desire no more to make us happy, than to beblessed of the Lord. We ought to beg spiritual blessings, not only forourselves, but for others; not only, The Lord bless me, but, The Lordbless thee; thus testifying our belief that there is enough for othersas well as for us, and showing our good will to others.

Psa 142:	<b>Overview</b><br>David's comfort in prayer.<br>--There can be no situation so distressing or dangerous, in which faithwill not get comfort from God by prayer. We are apt to show ourtroubles too much to ourselves, poring upon them, which does us noservice; whereas, by showing them to God, we might cast the cares uponhim who careth for us, and thereby ease ourselves. Nor should we allowany complaint to ourselves or others, which we cannot make to God. Whenour spirits are overwhelmed by distress, and filled withdiscouragement; when we see snares laid for us on every side, while wewalk in his way, we may reflect with comfort that the Lord knoweth ourpath. Those who in sincerity take the Lord for their God, find himall-sufficient, as a Refuge, and as a Portion: every thing else is arefuge of lies, and a portion of no value. In this situation Davidprayed earnestly to God. We may apply it spiritually; the souls ofbelievers are often straitened by doubts and fears. And it is thentheir duty and interest to beg of God to set them at liberty, that theymay run the way of his commandments. Thus the Lord delivered David fromhis powerful persecutors, and dealt bountifully with him. Thus heraised the crucified Redeemer to the throne of glory, and made him Headover all things for his church. Thus the convinced sinner cries forhelp, and is brought to praise the Lord in the company of his redeemedpeople; and thus all believers will at length be delivered from thisevil world, from sin and death, and praise their Saviour for ever.

Psa 150:	<b>Overview</b><br>A psalm of praise.<br>--We are here stirred up to praise God. Praise God for his sanctuary,and the privileges we enjoy by having it among us; praise him becauseof his power and glory in the firmament. Those who praise the Lord inheaven, behold displays of his power and glory which we cannot nowconceive. But the greatest of all his mighty acts is known in hisearthly sanctuary. The holiness and the love of our God are moredisplayed in man's redemption, than in all his other works. Let uspraise our God and Saviour for it. We need not care to know whatinstruments of music are mentioned. Hereby is meant that in serving Godwe should spare no cost or pains. Praise God with strong faith; praisehim with holy love and delight; praise him with entire confidence inChrist; praise him with believing triumph over the powers of darkness;praise him by universal respect to all his commands; praise him bycheerful submission to all his disposals; praise him by rejoicing inhis love, and comforting ourselves in his goodness; praise him bypromoting the interests of the kingdom of his grace; praise him bylively hope and expectation of the kingdom of his glory. Since we mustshortly breathe our last, while we have breath let us praise the Lord;then we shall breathe our last with comfort. Let every thing that hathbreath praise the Lord. Praise ye the Lord. Such is the very suitableend of a book inspired by the Spirit of God, written for the work ofpraise; a book which has supplied the songs of the church for more thanthree thousand years; a book which is quoted more frequently than anyother by Christ and his apostles; a book which presents the loftiestideas of God and his government, which is fitted to every state ofhuman life, which sets forth every state of religious experience, andwhich bears simple and clear marks of its Divine origin.

(Eccl.1:9-11) The vexation in pursuit of knowledge. (Eccl. 1:12-18)<br>Eccl. 1:1-3 Much is to be learned by comparing one part of Scripturewith another. We here behold Solomon returning from the broken andempty cisterns of the world, to the Fountain of living water; recordinghis own folly and shame, the bitterness of his disappointment, and thelessons he had learned. Those that have taken warning to turn and live,should warn others not to go on and die. He does not merely say allthings are vain, but that they are vanity. VANITY OF VANITIES, ALL ISVANITY. This is the text of the preacher's sermon, of which in thisbook he never loses sight. If this world, in its present state, wereall, it would not be worth living for; and the wealth and pleasure ofthis world, if we had ever so much, are not enough to make us happy.What profit has a man of all his labour? All he gets by it will notsupply the wants of the soul, nor satisfy its desires; will not atonefor the sins of the soul, nor hinder the loss of it: what profit willthe wealth of the world be to the soul in death, in judgment, or in theeverlasting state?<br>Eccl. 1:4-8 All things change, and never rest. Man, after all hislabour, is no nearer finding rest than the sun, the wind, or thecurrent of the river. His soul will find no rest, if he has it not fromGod. The senses are soon tired, yet still craving what is untried.<br>Eccl. 1:9-11 Men's hearts and their corruptions are the same now as informer times; their desires, and pursuits, and complaints, still thesame. This should take us from expecting happiness in the creature, andquicken us to seek eternal blessings. How many things and persons inSolomon's day were thought very great, yet there is no remembrance ofthem now!<br>Eccl. 1:12-18 Solomon tried all things, and found them vanity. He foundhis searches after knowledge weariness, not only to the flesh, but tothe mind. The more he saw of the works done under the sun, the more hesaw their vanity; and the sight often vexed his spirit. He couldneither gain that satisfaction to himself, nor do that good to others,which he expected. Even the pursuit of knowledge and wisdom discoveredman's wickedness and misery; so that the more he knew, the more he sawcause to lament and mourn. Let us learn to hate and fear sin, the causeof all this vanity and misery; to value Christ; to seek rest in theknowledge, love, and service of the Saviour.
Ecc 2:	<b>Overview</b><br>The vanity and vexation of mirth, sensual pleasure, riches, and pomp.(Eccl. 2:1-11) Human wisdom insufficient. (Eccl. 2:12-17) This world tobe used according to the will of God. (Eccl. 2:18-26)<br>Eccl. 2:1-11 Solomon soon found mirth and pleasure to be vanity. Whatdoes noisy, flashy mirth towards making a man happy? The manifolddevices of men's hearts, to get satisfaction from the world, and theirchanging from one thing to another, are like the restlessness of a manin a fever. Perceiving it was folly to give himself to wine, he nexttried the costly amusements of princes. The poor, when they read such adescription, are ready to feel discontent. But the remedy against allsuch feelings is in the estimate of it all by the owner himself. Allwas vanity and vexation of spirit: and the same things would yield thesame result to us, as to Solomon. Having food and raiment, let ustherewith be content. His wisdom remained with him; a strongunderstanding, with great human knowledge. But every earthly pleasure,when unconnected with better blessings, leaves the mind as eager andunsatisfied as before. Happiness arises not from the situation in whichwe are placed. It is only through Jesus Christ that final blessednesscan be attained.<br>Eccl. 2:12-17 Solomon found that knowledge and prudence were preferableto ignorance and folly, though human wisdom and knowledge will not makea man happy. The most learned of men, who dies a stranger to ChristJesus, will perish equally with the most ignorant; and what good cancommendations on earth do to the body in the grave, or the soul inhell? And the spirits of just men made perfect cannot want them. Sothat if this were all, we might be led to hate our life, as it is allvanity and vexation of spirit.<br>Eccl. 2:18-26 Our hearts are very loth to quit their expectations ofgreat things from the creature; but Solomon came to this at length. Theworld is a vale of tears, even to those that have much of it. See whatfools they are, who make themselves drudges to the world, which affordsa man nothing better than subsistence for the body. And the utmost hecan attain in this respect is to allow himself a sober, cheerful usethereof, according to his rank and condition. But we must enjoy good inour labour; we must use those things to make us diligent and cheerfulin worldly business. And this is the gift of God. Riches are a blessingor a curse to a man, according as he has, or has not, a heart to make agood use of them. To those that are accepted of the Lord, he gives joyand satisfaction in the knowledge and love of him. But to the sinner heallots labour, sorrow, vanity, and vexation, in seeking a worldlyportion, which yet afterwards comes into better hands. Let the sinnerseriously consider his latter end. To seek a lasting portion in thelove of Christ and the blessings it bestows, is the only way to trueand satisfying enjoyment even of this present world.
Ecc 3:	<b>Overview</b><br>The changes of human affairs. (Eccl. 3:1-10) The Divine counselsunchangeable. (Eccl. 3:11-15) The vanity of worldly power. (Eccl.3:16-22)<br>Eccl. 3:1-10 To expect unchanging happiness in a changing world, mustend in disappointment. To bring ourselves to our state in life, is ourduty and wisdom in this world. God's whole plan for the government ofthe world will be found altogether wise, just, and good. Then let usseize the favourable opportunity for every good purpose and work. Thetime to die is fast approaching. Thus labour and sorrow fill the world.This is given us, that we may always have something to do; none weresent into the world to be idle.<br>Eccl. 3:11-15 Every thing is as God made it; not as it appears to us.We have the world so much in our hearts, are so taken up with thoughtsand cares of worldly things, that we have neither time nor spirit tosee God's hand in them. The world has not only gained possession of theheart, but has formed thoughts against the beauty of God's works. Wemistake if we think we were born for ourselves; no, it is our businessto do good in this life, which is short and uncertain; we have butlittle time to be doing good, therefore we should redeem time.Satisfaction with Divine Providence, is having faith that all thingswork together for good to them that love him. God doeth all, that menshould fear before him. The world, as it has been, is, and will be.There has no change befallen us, nor has any temptation by it taken us,but such as is common to men.<br>Eccl. 3:16-22 Without the fear of the Lord, man is but vanity; set thataside, and judges will not use their power well. And there is anotherJudge that stands before the door. With God there is a time for theredressing of grievances, though as yet we see it not. Solomon seems toexpress his wish that men might perceive, that by choosing this worldas their portion, they brought themselves to a level with the beasts,without being free, as they are, from present vexations and a futureaccount. Both return to the dust from whence they were taken. Whatlittle reason have we to be proud of our bodies, or bodilyaccomplishments! But as none can fully comprehend, so few considerproperly, the difference between the rational soul of man, and thespirit or life of the beast. The spirit of man goes upward, to bejudged, and is then fixed in an unchangeable state of happiness ormisery. It is as certain that the spirit of the beast goes downward tothe earth; it perishes at death. Surely their case is lamentable, theheight of whose hopes and wishes is, that they may die like beasts. Letour inquiry be, how an eternity of existence may be to us an eternityof enjoyment? To answer this, is the grand design of revelation. Jesusis revealed as the Son of God, and the Hope of sinners.

(Eccl.4:13-16)<br>Eccl. 4:1-3 It grieved Solomon to see might prevail against right.Wherever we turn, we see melancholy proofs of the wickedness and miseryof mankind, who try to create trouble to themselves and to each other.Being thus hardly used, men are tempted to hate and despise life. But agood man, though badly off while in this world, cannot have cause towish he had never been born, since he is glorifying the Lord, even inthe fires, and will be happy at last, for ever happy. Ungodly men havemost cause to wish the continuance of life with all its vexations, as afar more miserable condition awaits them if they die in their sins. Ifhuman and worldly things were our chief good, not to exist would bepreferable to life, considering the various oppressions here below.<br>Eccl. 4:4-6 Solomon notices the sources of trouble peculiar towell-doers, and includes all who labour with diligence, and whoseefforts are crowned with success. They often become great andprosperous, but this excites envy and opposition. Others, seeing thevexations of an active course, foolishly expect more satisfaction insloth and idleness. But idleness is a sin that is its own punishment.Let us by honest industry lay hold on the handful, that we may not wantnecessaries, but not grasp at both hands full, which would only createvexation of spirit. Moderate pains and gains do best.<br>Eccl. 4:7,8 Frequently, the more men have, the more they would have;and on this they are so intent, that they get no enjoyment from whatthey have. Selfishness is the cause of this evil. A selfish man caresfor nobody; there is none to take care of but himself, yet he willscarcely allow necessary rest to himself, and the people he employs. Henever thinks he has enough. He has enough for his calling, for hisfamily, but he has not enough for his eyes. Many are so set upon theworld, that in pursuit of it they bereave themselves, not only of thefavour of God and eternal life, but of the pleasures of this life. Thedistant relations or strangers who inherit such a man's wealth, neverthank him. Covetousness gathers strength by time and habit; mentottering on the brink of the grave, grow more grasping and griping.Alas, and how often do we see men professing to be followers of Him,who, "though he was rich, for our sakes became poor," anxiouslyscraping money together and holding it fast, excusing themselves bycommon-place talking about the necessity of care, and the danger ofextravagance!<br>Eccl. 4:9-12 Surely he has more satisfaction in life, who labours hardto maintain those he loves, than the miser has in his toil. In allthings union tends to success and safety, but above all, the union ofChristians. They assist each other by encouragement, or friendlyreproof. They warm each other's hearts while they converse together ofthe love of Christ, or join in singing his praises. Then let us improveour opportunities of Christian fellowship. In these things all is notvanity, though there will be some alloy as long as we are under thesun. Where two are closely joined in holy love and fellowship, Christwill by his Spirit come to them; then there is a threefold cord.<br>Eccl. 4:13-16 People are never long easy and satisfied; they are fondof changes. This is no new thing. Princes see themselves slighted bythose they have studied to oblige; this is vanity and vexation ofspirit. But the willing servants of the Lord Jesus, our King, rejoicein him alone, and they will love Him more and more to all eternity.

(Eccl. 5:18-20)<br>Eccl. 5:1-3 Address thyself to the worship of God, and take time tocompose thyself for it. Keep thy thoughts from roving and wandering:keep thy affections from running out toward wrong objects. We shouldavoid vain repetitions; copious prayers are not here condemned, butthose that are unmeaning. How often our wandering thoughts renderattendance on Divine ordinances little better than the sacrifice offools! Many words and hasty ones, used in prayer, show folly in theheart, low thoughts of God, and careless thoughts of our own souls.<br>Eccl. 5:4-8 When a person made engagements rashly, he suffered hismouth to cause his flesh to sin. The case supposes a man coming to thepriest, and pretending that his vow was made rashly, and that it wouldbe wrong to fulfil it. Such mockery of God would bring the Divinedispleasure, which might blast what was thus unduly kept. We are tokeep down the fear of man. Set God before thee; then, if thou seest theoppression of the poor, thou wilt not find fault with DivineProvidence; nor think the worse of the institution of magistracy, whenthou seest the ends of it thus perverted; nor of religion, when thouseest it will not secure men from suffering wrong. But thoughoppressors may be secure, God will reckon for all.<br>Eccl. 5:9-17 The goodness of Providence is more equally distributedthan appears to a careless observer. The king needs the common thingsof life, and the poor share them; they relish their morsel better thanhe does his luxuries. There are bodily desires which silver itself willnot satisfy, much less will worldly abundance satisfy spiritualdesires. The more men have, the better house they must keep, the moreservants they must employ, the more guests they must entertain, and themore they will have hanging on them. The sleep of the labourer issweet, not only because he is tired, but because he has little care tobreak his sleep. The sleep of the diligent Christian, and his longsleep, are sweet; having spent himself and his time in the service ofGod, he can cheerfully repose in God as his Rest. But those who haveevery thing else, often fail to secure a good night's sleep; theirabundance breaks their rest. Riches do hurt, and draw away the heartfrom God and duty. Men do hurt with their riches, not only gratifyingtheir own lusts, but oppressing others, and dealing hardly with them.They will see that they have laboured for the wind, when, at death,they find the profit of their labour is all gone like the wind, theyknow not whither. How ill the covetous worldling bears the calamitiesof human life! He does not sorrow to repentance, but is angry at theprovidence of God, angry at all about him; which doubles hisaffliction.<br>Eccl. 5:18-20 Life is God's gift. We must not view our calling as adrudgery, but take pleasure in the calling where God puts us. Acheerful spirit is a great blessing; it makes employments easy, andafflictions light. Having made a proper use of riches, a man willremember the days of his past life with pleasure. The manner in whichSolomon refers to God as the Giver, both of life and its enjoyments,shows they ought to be received and to be used, consistently with hiswill, and to his glory. Let this passage recommend to all the kindwords of the merciful Redeemer, "Labour not for the meat thatperisheth, but for that meat which endureth unto everlasting life."Christ is the Bread of life, the only food of the soul. All are invitedto partake of this heavenly provision.
Ecc 6:	<b>Overview</b><br>The vanity of riches. Also of long life and flourishing families.(Eccl. 6:1-6) The little advantage any one has in outward things.(Eccl. 6:7-12)<br>Eccl. 6:1-6 A man often has all he needs for outward enjoyment; yet theLord leaves him so to covetousness or evil dispositions, that he makesno good or comfortable use of what he has. By one means or other hispossessions come to strangers; this is vanity, and an evil disease. Anumerous family was a matter of fond desire and of high honour amongthe Hebrews; and long life is the desire of mankind in general. Evenwith these additions a man may not be able to enjoy his riches, family,and life. Such a man, in his passage through life, seems to have beenborn for no end or use. And he who has entered on life only for onemoment, to quit it the next, has a preferable lot to him who has livedlong, but only to suffer.<br>Eccl. 6:7-12 A little will serve to sustain us comfortably, and a greatdeal can do no more. The desires of the soul find nothing in the wealthof the world to give satisfaction. The poor man has comfort as well asthe richest, and is under no real disadvantage. We cannot say, Betteris the sight of the eyes than the resting of the soul in God; for it isbetter to live by faith in things to come, than to live by sense, whichdwells only upon present things. Our lot is appointed. We have whatpleases God, and let that please us. The greatest possessions andhonours cannot set us above the common events of human life. Seeingthat the things men pursue on earth increase vanities, what is man thebetter for his worldly devices? Our life upon earth is to be reckonedby days. It is fleeting and uncertain, and with little in it to be fondof, or to be depended on. Let us return to God, trust in his mercythrough Jesus Christ, and submit to his will. Then soon shall we glidethrough this vexatious world, and find ourselves in that happy place,where there is fulness of joy and pleasures for evermore.
Ecc 7:	<b>Overview</b><br>The benefit of a good name; of death above life; of sorrow above vainmirth. (Eccl. 7:1-6) Concerning oppression, anger, and discontent.(Eccl. 7:7-10) Advantages of wisdom. (Eccl. 7:11-22) Experience of theevil of sin. (Eccl. 7:23-29)<br>Eccl. 7:1-6 Reputation for piety and honesty is more desirable than allthe wealth and pleasure in this world. It will do more good to go to afuneral than to a feast. We may lawfully go to both, as there isoccasion; our Saviour both feasted at the wedding of his friend inCana, and wept at the grave of his friend in Bethany. But, consideringhow apt we are to be vain and indulge the flesh, it is best to go tothe house of mourning, to learn the end of man as to this world.Seriousness is better than mirth and jollity. That is best for us whichis best for our souls, though it be unpleasing to sense. It is betterto have our corruptions mortified by the rebuke of the wise, than tohave them gratified by the song of fools. The laughter of a fool issoon gone, the end of his mirth is heaviness.<br>Eccl. 7:7-10 The event of our trials and difficulties is often betterthan at first we thought. Surely it is better to be patient in spirit,than to be proud and hasty. Be not soon angry, nor quick in resentingan affront. Be not long angry; though anger may come into the bosom ofa wise man, it passes through it as a way-faring man; it dwells only inthe bosom of fools. It is folly to cry out upon the badness of ourtimes, when we have more reason to cry out for the badness of our ownhearts; and even in these times we enjoy many mercies. It is folly tocry up the goodness of former times; as if former ages had not the likethings to complain of that we have: this arises from discontent, andaptness to quarrel with God himself.<br>Eccl. 7:11-22 Wisdom is as good as an inheritance, yea better. Itshelters from the storms and scorching heat of trouble. Wealth will notlengthen out the natural life; but true wisdom will give spirituallife, and strengthen men for services under their sufferings. Let uslook upon the disposal of our condition as the work of God, and at lastall will appear to have been for the best. In acts of righteousness, benot carried into heats or passions, no, not by a zeal for God. Be notconceited of thine own abilities; nor find fault with every thing, norbusy thyself in other men's matters. Many who will not be wrought uponby the fear of God, and the dread of hell, will avoid sins which ruintheir health and estate, and expose to public justice. But those thattruly fear God, have but one end to serve, therefore act steadily. Ifwe say we have not sinned, we deceive ourselves. Every true believer isready to say, God be merciful to me a sinner. Forget not at the sametime, that personal righteousness, walking in newness of life, is theonly real evidence of an interest by faith in the righteousness of theRedeemer. Wisdom teaches us not to be quick in resenting affronts. Benot desirous to know what people say; if they speak well of thee, itwill feed thy pride, if ill, it will stir up thy passion. See that thouapprove thyself to God and thine own conscience, and then heed not whatmen say of thee; it is easier to pass by twenty affronts than to avengeone. When any harm is done to us, examine whether we have not done asbad to others.<br>Eccl. 7:23-29 Solomon, in his search into the nature and reason ofthings, had been miserably deluded. But he here speaks with godlysorrow. He alone who constantly aims to please God, can expect toescape; the careless sinner probably will fall to rise no more. He nowdiscovered more than ever the evil of the great sin of which he hadbeen guilty, the loving many strange women, I Kin. 11:1. A womanthoroughly upright and godly, he had not found. How was he likely tofind such a one among those he had collected? If any of them had beenwell disposed, their situation would tend to render them all nearly ofthe same character. He here warns others against the sins into which hehad been betrayed. Many a godly man can with thankfulness acknowledgethat he has found a prudent, virtuous woman in the wife of his bosom;but those men who have gone in Solomon's track, cannot expect to findone. He traces up all the streams of actual transgression to thefountain. It is clear that man is corrupted and revolted, and not as hewas made. It is lamentable that man, whom God made upright, has foundout so many ways to render himself wicked and miserable. Let us blessHim for Jesus Christ, and seek his grace, that we may be numbered withhis chosen people.
Ecc 8:	<b>Overview</b><br>Commendations of wisdom. (Eccl. 8:1-5) To prepare for sudden evils anddeath. (Eccl. 8:6-8) It shall be well with the righteous, and ill withthe wicked. (Eccl. 8:9-13) Mysteries of Providence. (Eccl. 8:14-17)<br>Eccl. 8:1-5 None of the rich, the powerful, the honourable, or theaccomplished of the sons of men, are so excellent, useful, or happy, asthe wise man. Who else can interpret the words of God, or teach arightfrom his truths and dispensations? What madness must it be for weak anddependent creatures to rebel against the Almighty! What numbers formwrong judgments, and bring misery on themselves, in this life and thatto come!<br>Eccl. 8:6-8 God has, in wisdom, kept away from us the knowledge offuture events, that we may be always ready for changes. We must alldie, no flight or hiding-place can save us, nor are there any weaponsof effectual resistance. Ninety thousand die every day, upwards ofsixty every minute, and one every moment. How solemn the thought! Ohthat men were wise, that they understood these things, that they wouldconsider their latter end! The believer alone is prepared to meet thesolemn summons. Wickedness, by which men often escape human justice,cannot secure from death.<br>Eccl. 8:9-13 Solomon observed, that many a time one man rules overanother to his hurt, and that prosperity hardens them in theirwickedness. Sinners herein deceive themselves. Vengeance comes slowly,but it comes surely. A good man's days have some substance; he lives toa good purpose: a wicked man's days are all as a shadow, empty andworthless. Let us pray that we may view eternal things as near, real,and all-important.<br>Eccl. 8:14-17 Faith alone can establish the heart in this mixed scene,where the righteous often suffer, and the wicked prosper. Solomoncommended joy, and holy security of mind, arising from confidence inGod, because a man has no better thing under the sun, though a good manhas much better things above the sun, than soberly and thankfully touse the things of this life according to his rank. He would not have ustry to give a reason for what God does. But, leaving the Lord to clearup all difficulties in his own time, we may cheerfully enjoy thecomforts, and bear up under the trials of life; while peace ofconscience and joy in the Holy Ghost will abide in us through alloutward changes, and when flesh and heart shall fail.
Ecc 9:	<b>Overview</b><br>Good and bad men fare alike as to this world. (Eccl. 9:1-3) All menmust die, Their portion as to this life. (Eccl. 9:4-10) Disappointmentscommon. (Eccl. 9:11,12) Benefits of wisdom. (Eccl. 9:13-18)<br>Eccl. 9:1-3 We are not to think our searching into the word or works ofGod useless, because we cannot explain all difficulties. We may learnmany things good for ourselves and useful to others. But man cannotalways decide who are objects of God's special love, or under hiswrath; and God will certainly put a difference between the precious andthe vile, in the other world. The difference as to present happiness,arises from the inward supports and consolations the righteous enjoy,and the benefit they derive from varied trials and mercies. As far asthe sons of men are left to themselves, their hearts are full of evil;and prosperity in sin, causes them even to set God at defiance bydaring wickedness. Though, on this side death, the righteous and thewicked may often seem to fare alike, on the other side there will be avast difference between them.<br>Eccl. 9:4-10 The most despicable living man's state, is preferable tothat of the most noble who have died impenitent. Solomon exhorts thewise and pious to cheerful confidence in God, whatever their conditionin life. The meanest morsel, coming from their Father's love, in answerto prayer, will have a peculiar relish. Not that we may set our heartsupon the delights of sense, but what God has given us we may use withwisdom. The joy here described, is the gladness of heart that springsfrom a sense of the Divine favour. This is the world of service, thatto come is the world of recompence. All in their stations, may findsome work to do. And above all, sinners have the salvation of theirsouls to seek after, believers have to prove their faith, adorn thegospel, glorify God, and serve their generation.<br>Eccl. 9:11,12 Men's success seldom equals their expectations. We mustuse means, but not trust to them: if we succeed, we must give God thepraise; if crossed, we must submit to his will. Those who put off thegreat concerns of their souls, are caught in Satan's net, which hebaits with some worldly object, for which they reject or neglect thegospel, and go on in sin till they suddenly fall into destruction.<br>Eccl. 9:13-18 A man may, by his wisdom, bring to pass that which hecould never do by his strength. If God be for us, who can be againstus, or stand before us? Solomon observes the power of wisdom, though itmay labour under outward disadvantages. How forcible are right words!But wise and good men must often content themselves with thesatisfaction of having done good, or, at least, endeavoured to do it,when they cannot do the good they would, nor have the praise theyshould. How many of the good gifts, both of nature and Providence, doesone sinner destroy and make waste! He who destroys his own souldestroys much good. One sinner may draw many into his destroying ways.See who are the friends and enemies of a kingdom or a family, if onesaint does much good, and one sinner destroys much good.
Ecc 10:	<b>Overview</b><br>To preserve a character for wisdom. (Eccl. 10:1-3) Respecting subjectsand rulers. (Eccl. 10:4-10) Of foolish talk. (Eccl. 10:11-15) Duties ofrulers and subjects. (Eccl. 10:16-20)<br>Eccl. 10:1-3 Those especially who make a profession of religion, shouldkeep from all appearances of evil. A wise man has great advantage overa fool, who is always at a loss when he has anything to do. Sin is thereproach of sinners, wherever they go, and shows their folly.<br>Eccl. 10:4-10 Solomon appears to caution men not to seek redress in ahasty manner, nor to yield to pride and revenge. Do not, in a passion,quit thy post of duty; wait awhile, and thou wilt find that yieldingpacifies great offences. Men are not preferred according to theirmerit. And those are often most forward to offer help, who are leastaware of the difficulties, or the consequences. The same remark isapplied to the church, or the body of Christ, that all the membersshould have the same care one for another.<br>Eccl. 10:11-15 There is a practice in the East, of charming serpents bymusic. The babbler's tongue is an unruly evil, full of deadly poison;and contradiction only makes it the more violent. We must find the wayto keep him gentle. But by rash, unprincipled, or slanderous talk, hebrings open or secret vengeance upon himself. Would we duly considerour own ignorance as to future events, it would cut off many idle wordswhich we foolishly multiply. Fools toil a great deal to no purpose.They do not understand the plainest things, such as the entrance into agreat city. But it is the excellency of the way to the heavenly city,that it is a high-way, in which the simplest wayfaring men shall noterr, Is. 25:8. But sinful folly makes men miss that only way tohappiness.<br>Eccl. 10:16-20 The happiness of a land depends on the character of itsrulers. The people cannot be happy when their princes are childish, andlovers of pleasure. Slothfulness is of ill consequence both to privateand public affairs. Money, of itself, will neither feed nor clothe,though it answers the occasions of this present life, as what is to behad, may generally be had for money. But the soul, as it is notredeemed, so it is not maintained with corruptible things, as silverand gold. God sees what men do, and hears what they say in secret; and,when he pleases, brings it to light by strange and unsuspected ways. Ifthere be hazard in secret thoughts and whispers against earthly rulers,what must be the peril from every deed, word, or thought of rebellionagainst the King of kings, and Lord of lords! He seeth in secret. Hisear is ever open. Sinner! curse not THIS KING in thy inmost thought.Your curses cannot affect Him; but his curse, coming down upon you,will sink you to the lowest hell.
Ecc 11:	<b>Overview</b><br>Exhortation to liberality. (Eccl. 11:1-6) An admonition to prepare fordeath, and to young persons to be religious. (Eccl. 11:7-10)<br>Eccl. 11:1-6 Solomon presses the rich to do good to others. Givefreely, though it may seem thrown away and lost. Give to many. Excusenot thyself with the good thou hast done, from the good thou hastfurther to do. It is not lost, but well laid out. We have reason toexpect evil, for we are born to trouble; it is wisdom to do good in theday of prosperity. Riches cannot profit us, if we do not benefitothers. Every man must labour to be a blessing to that place where theprovidence of God casts him. Wherever we are, we may find good work todo, if we have but hearts to do it. If we magnify every littledifficulty, start objections, and fancy hardships, we shall never goon, much less go through with our work. Winds and clouds of tribulationare, in God's hands, designed to try us. God's work shall agree withhis word, whether we see it or not. And we may well trust God toprovide for us, without our anxious, disquieting cares. Be not weary inwell-doing, for in due season, in God's time, you shall reap, Gal. 6:9.<br>Eccl. 11:7-10 Life is sweet to bad men, because they have their portionin this life; it is sweet to good men, because it is the time ofpreparation for a better; it is sweet to all. Here is a caution tothink of death, even when life is most sweet. Solomon makes aneffecting address to young persons. They would desire opportunity topursue every pleasure. Then follow your desires, but be assured thatGod will call you into judgment. How many give loose to every appetite,and rush into every vicious pleasure! But God registers every one oftheir sinful thoughts and desires, their idle words and wicked words.If they would avoid remorse and terror, if they would have hope andcomfort on a dying bed, if they would escape misery here and hereafter,let them remember the vanity of youthful pleasures. That Solomon meansto condemn the pleasures of sin is evident. His object is to draw theyoung to purer and more lasting joys. This is not the language of onegrudging youthful pleasures, because he can no longer partake of them;but of one who has, by a miracle of mercy, been brought back in safety.He would persuade the young from trying a course whence so few return.If the young would live a life of true happiness, if they would securehappiness hereafter, let them remember their Creator in the days oftheir youth.
Ecc 12:	<b>Overview</b><br>A description of the infirmities of age. (Eccl. 12:1-7) All is vanity:also a warning of the judgment to come. (Eccl. 12:8-14)<br>Eccl. 12:1-7 We should remember our sins against our Creator, repent,and seek forgiveness. We should remember our duties, and set aboutthem, looking to him for grace and strength. This should be done early,while the body is strong, and the spirits active. When a man has thepain of reviewing a misspent life, his not having given up sin andworldly vanities till he is forced to say, I have no pleasure in them,renders his sincerity very questionable. Then follows a figurativedescription of old age and its infirmities, which has somedifficulties; but the meaning is plain, to show how uncomfortable,generally, the days of old age are. As the four verses, 2-5, are afigurative description of the infirmities that usually accompany oldage, Eccl. 12:6 notices the circumstances which take place in the hourof death. If sin had not entered into the world, these infirmitieswould not have been known. Surely then the aged should reflect on theevil of sin.<br>Eccl. 12:8-14 Solomon repeats his text, VANITY OF VANITIES, ALL ISVANITY. These are the words of one that could speak by dear-boughtexperience of the vanity of the world, which can do nothing to ease menof the burden of sin. As he considered the worth of souls, he gave goodheed to what he spake and wrote; words of truth will always beacceptable words. The truths of God are as goads to such as are dulland draw back, and nails to such as are wandering and draw aside; meansto establish the heart, that we may never sit loose to our duty, nor betaken from it. The Shepherd of Israel is the Giver of inspired wisdom.Teachers and guides all receive their communications from him. Thetitle is applied in Scripture to the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God.The prophets sought diligently, what, or what manner of time, theSpirit of Christ in them did signify, when it testified beforehand thesufferings of Christ, and the glory that should follow. To write manybooks was not suited to the shortness of human life, and would beweariness to the writer, and to the reader; and then was much more soto both than it is now. All things would be vanity and vexation, exceptthey led to this conclusion, That to fear God, and keep hiscommandments, is the whole of man. The fear of God includes in it allthe affections of the soul towards him, which are produced by the HolySpirit. There may be terror where there is no love, nay, where there ishatred. But this is different from the gracious fear of God, as thefeelings of an affectionate child. The fear of God, is often put forthe whole of true religion in the heart, and includes its practicalresults in the life. Let us attend to the one thing needful, and nowcome to him as a merciful Saviour, who will soon come as an almightyJudge, when he will bring to light the things of darkness, and manifestthe counsels of all hearts. Why does God record in his word, that ALLIS VANITY, but to keep us from deceiving ourselves to our ruin? Hemakes our duty to be our interest. May it be graven in all our hearts.Fear God, and keep his commandments, for this is all that concerns man.
Son 1:	<b>Overview</b><br>The title. (Song 1:1) The church confesses her deformity. (Song 1:2-6)The church beseeches Christ to lead her to the resting-place of hispeople. (Song 1:7,8) Christ's commendation of the church, Her esteemfor Him. (Song 1:9-17)<br>Song 1:1 This is "the Song of songs," excellent above any others, forit is wholly taken up with describing the excellences of Christ, andthe love between him and his redeemed people.<br>Song 1:2-6 The church, or rather the believer, speaks here in thecharacter of the spouse of the King, the Messiah. The kisses of hismouth mean those assurances of pardon with which believers arefavoured, filling them with peace and joy in believing, and causingthem to abound in hope by the power of the Holy Ghost. Gracious soulstake most pleasure in loving Christ, and being loved of him. Christ'slove is more valuable and desirable than the best this world can give.The name of Christ is not now like ointment sealed up, but likeointment poured forth; which denotes the freeness and fulness of thesetting forth of his grace by the gospel. Those whom he has redeemedand sanctified, are here the virgins that love Jesus Christ, and followhim whithersoever he goes, Rev. 14:4. They entreat him to draw them bythe quickening influences of his Spirit. The more clearly we discernChrist's glory, the more sensible shall we be that we are unable tofollow him suitably, and at the same time be more desirous of doing it.Observe the speedy answer given to this prayer. Those who wait atWisdom's gate, shall be led into truth and comfort. And being broughtinto this chamber, our griefs will vanish. We have no joy but inChrist, and for this we are indebted to him. We will remember to givethanks for thy love; it shall make more lasting impressions upon usthan any thing in this world. Nor is any love acceptable to Christ butlove in sincerity, Eph. 6:24. The daughters of Jerusalem may meanprofessors not yet established in the faith. The spouse was black asthe tents of the wandering Arabs, but comely as the magnificentcurtains in the palaces of Solomon. The believer is black, as beingdefiled and sinful by nature, but comely, as renewed by Divine grace tothe holy image of God. He is still deformed with remains of sin, butcomely as accepted in Christ. He is often base and contemptible in theesteem of men, but excellent in the sight of God. The blackness wasowing to the hard usage that had been suffered. The children of thechurch, her mother, but not of God, her Father, were angry with her.They had made her suffer hardships, which caused her to neglect thecare of her soul. Thus, under the emblem of a poor female, made thechosen partner of a prince, we are led to consider the circumstances inwhich the love of Christ is accustomed to find its objects. They werewretched slaves of sin, in toil, or in sorrow, weary and heavy laden,but how great the change when the love of Christ is manifested to theirsouls!<br>Song 1:7,8 Observe the title given to Christ, O Thou whom my soulloveth. Those that do so, may come to him boldly, and may humbly pleadwith him. Is it with God's people a noon-time of outward troubles,inward conflicts? Christ has rest for them. Those whose souls loveJesus Christ, earnestly desire to share in the privileges of his flock.Turning aside from Christ is what gracious souls dread more thananything else. God is ready to answer prayer. Follow the track, ask forthe good old way, observe the footsteps of the flock, look what hasbeen the practice of godly people. Sit under the direction of goodministers; beside the tents of the under shepherds. Bring thy chargewith thee, they shall all be welcome. It will be the earnest desire andprayer of the Christian, that God would so direct him in his worldlybusiness, and so order his situation and employment, that he may havehis Lord and Saviour always before him.<br>Song 1:9-17 The Bridegroom gives high praises of his spouse. In thesight of Christ believers are the excellent of the earth, fitted to beinstruments for promoting his glory. The spiritual gifts and graceswhich Christ bestows on every true believer, are described by theornaments then in use, Song 1:10,11. The graces of the saints are many,but there is dependence upon each other. He who is the Author, will bethe Finisher of the good work. The grace received from Christ'sfulness, springs forth into lively exercises of faith, affection, andgratitude. Yet Christ, not his gifts, is most precious to them. Theword translated "camphire," signifies "atonement or propitiation."Christ is dear to all believers, because he is the propitiation fortheir sins. No pretender must have his place in the soul. They resolvedto lodge him in their hearts all the night; during the continuance ofthe troubles of life. Christ takes delight in the good work which hisgrace has wrought on the souls of believers. This should engage all whoare made holy, to be very thankful for that grace which has made thosefair, who by nature were deformed. The spouse (the believer) has ahumble, modest eye, discovering simplicity and godly sincerity; eyesenlightened and guided by the Holy Spirit, that blessed Dove. Thechurch expresses her value for Christ. Thou art the great Original, butI am but a faint and imperfect copy. Many are fair to look at, yettheir temper renders them unpleasant: but Christ is fair, yet pleasant.The believer, Song 1:16, speaks with praise of those holy ordinances inwhich true believers have fellowship with Christ. Whether the believeris in the courts of the Lord, or in retirement; whether following hisdaily labours, or confined on the bed of sickness, or even in adungeon, a sense of the Divine presence will turn the place into aparadise. Thus the soul, daily having fellowship with the Father, theSon, and the Holy Spirit, enjoys a lively hope of an incorruptible,undefiled, and unfading inheritance above.
Son 2:	<b>Overview</b><br>The mutual love of Christ and his church. (Song 2:1-7) The hope andcalling of the church. (Song 2:8-13) Christ's care of the church, Herfaith and hope. (Song 2:14-17)<br>Song 2:1-7 Believers are beautiful, as clothed in the righteousness ofChrist; and fragrant, as adorned with the graces of his Spirit; andthey thrive under the refreshing beams of the Sun of righteousness. Thelily is a very noble plant in the East; it grows to a considerableheight, but has a weak stem. The church is weak in herself, yet isstrong in Him that supports her. The wicked, the daughters of thisworld, who have no love to Christ, are as thorns, worthless anduseless, noxious and hurtful. Corruptions are thorns in the flesh; butthe lily now among thorns, shall be transplanted into that paradisewhere there is no brier or thorn. The world is a barren tree to thesoul; but Christ is a fruitful one. And when poor souls are parchedwith convictions of sin, with the terrors of the law, or the troublesof this world, weary and heavy laden, they may find rest in Christ. Itis not enough to pass by this shadow, but we must sit down under it.Believers have tasted that the Lord Jesus is gracious; his fruits areall the precious privileges of the new covenant, purchased by hisblood, and communicated by his Spirit; promises are sweet to abeliever, and precepts also. Pardons are sweet, and peace of consciencesweet. If our mouths are out of taste for the pleasures of sin, Divineconsolations will be sweet to us. Christ brings the soul to seek and tofind comforts through his ordinances, which are as a banqueting-housewhere his saints feast with him. The love of Christ, manifested by hisdeath, and by his word, is the banner he displays, and believers resortto it. How much better is it with the soul when sick from love toChrist, than when surfeited with the love of this world! And thoughChrist seemed to have withdrawn, yet he was even then a very presenthelp. All his saints are in his hand, which tenderly holds their achingheads. Finding Christ thus nigh to her, the soul is in great care thather communion with him is not interrupted. We easily grieve the Spiritby wrong tempers. Let those who have comfort, fear sinning it away.<br>Song 2:8-13 The church pleases herself with thoughts of furthercommunion with Christ. None besides can speak to the heart. She seeshim come. This may be applied to the prospect the Old Testament saintshad of Christ's coming in the flesh. He comes as pleased with his ownundertaking. He comes speedily. Even when Christ seems to forsake, itis but for a moment; he will soon return with everlastingloving-kindness. The saints of old saw him, appearing through thesacrifices and ceremonial institutions. We see him through a glassdarkly, as he manifests himself through the lattices. Christ invitesthe new convert to arise from sloth and despondency, and to leave sinand worldly vanities, for union and communion with him. The winter maymean years passed in ignorance and sin, unfruitful and miserable, orstorms and tempests that accompanied his conviction of guilt anddanger. Even the unripe fruits of holiness are pleasant unto Him whosegrace has produced them. All these encouraging tokens and evidences ofDivine favour, are motives to the soul to follow Christ more fully.Arise then, and come away from the world and the flesh, come intofellowship with Christ. This blessed change is owing wholly to theapproaches and influences of the Sun of righteousness.<br>Song 2:14-17 The church is Christ's dove; she returns to him, as herNoah. Christ is the Rock, in whom alone she can think herself safe, andfind herself easy, as a dove in the hole of a rock, when struck at bythe birds of prey. Christ calls her to come boldly to the throne ofgrace, having a great High Priest there, to tell what her request is.Speak freely, fear not a slight or a repulse. The voice of prayer issweet and acceptable to God; those who are sanctified have the bestcomeliness. The first risings of sinful thoughts and desires, thebeginnings of trifling pursuits which waste the time, trifling visits,small departures from truth, whatever would admit some conformity tothe world; all these, and many more, are little foxes which must beremoved. This is a charge to believers to mortify their sinfulappetites and passions, which are as little foxes, that destroy theirgraces and comforts, and crush good beginnings. Whatever we find ahinderance to us in that which is good, we must put away. He feedethamong the lilies; this shows Christ's gracious presence amongbelievers. He is kind to all his people. It becomes them to believethis, when under desertion and absence, and so to ward off temptations.The shadows of the Jewish dispensation were dispelled by the dawning ofthe gospel day. And a day of comfort will come after a night ofdesertion. Come over the mountains of Bether, "the mountains thatdivide," looking forward to that day of light and love. Christ willcome over every separating mountain to take us home to himself.
Son 3:	<b>Overview</b><br>The trials of the church by the withdrawing of Christ. (Song 3:1-5) Theexcellences of the church, The care of Christ for her. (Song 3:6-11)<br>Song 3:1-5 It was hard to the Old Testament church to find Christ inthe ceremonial law; the watchmen of that church gave little assistanceto those who sought after him. The night is a time of coldness,darkness, and drowsiness, and of dim apprehensions concerning spiritualthings. At first, when uneasy, some feeble efforts are made to obtainthe comfort of communion with Christ. This proves in vain; the believeris then roused to increased diligence. The streets and broad-ways seemto imply the means of grace in which the Lord is to be sought.Application is made to those who watch for men's souls. Immediatesatisfaction is not found. We must not rest in any means, but by faithapply directly to Christ. The holding of Christ, and not letting himgo, denotes earnest cleaving to him. What prevails is a humble, ardentsuing by prayer, with a lively exercise of faith on his promises. Solong as the faith of believers keeps hold of Christ, he will not beoffended at their earnest asking, yea, he is well pleased with it. Thebeliever desires to make others acquainted with his Saviour. Whereverwe find Christ, we must take him home with us to our houses, especiallyto our hearts; and we should call upon ourselves and each other, tobeware of grieving our holy Comforter, and provoking the departure ofthe Beloved.<br>Song 3:6-11 A wilderness is an emblem of the world; the believer comesout of it when he is delivered from the love of its sinful pleasuresand pursuits, and refuses to comply with its customs and fashions, toseek happiness in communion with the Saviour. A poor soul shall comeup, at last, under the conduct of the Comforter; like a cloud ofincense ascending from the altar, or the smoke of the burnt-offerings.This signifies pious and devout affections, and the mounting of thesoul heaven-ward. The believer is filled with the graces of God'sSpirit; his devotions now are very lively. These graces and comfortsare from the heavenly Canaan. He, who is the Peace of his people, theKing of the heavenly Zion, has provided for the safe conveyance of hisredeemed through the wilderness of this world. The bed, or palanquin,was contrived for rest and easy conveyance, but its beauty andmagnificence showed the quality of its owner. The church is wellguarded; more are with her than are against her: believers, when theyrepose in Christ, and with him, though they have their fears in thenight, are yet safe. The chariot here denotes the covenant ofredemption, the way of our salvation. This is that work of Christ,which makes him loved and admired in the eyes of believers. It isframed and contrived, both for the glory of Christ, and for the comfortof believers; it is well ordered in all things and sure. The blood ofthe covenant, that rich purple, is the cover of this chariot, by whichbelievers are sheltered from the wind and storms of Divine wrath, andthe troubles of this world; but the midst of it is that love of Christwhich passes knowledge, this is for believers to repose upon. Christ,in his gospel, manifests himself. Take special notice of his crown.Applying this to Christ, it speaks the honour put upon him, and hispower and dominion.
Son 4:	<b>Overview</b><br>Christ sets forth the graces of the church. (Song 4:1-7) Christ's loveto the church. (Song 4:8-15) The church desires further influences ofDivine grace. (Song 4:16)<br>Song 4:1-7 If each of these comparisons has a meaning applicable to thegraces of the church, or of the faithful Christian, they are notclearly known; and great mistakes are made by fanciful guesses. Themountain of myrrh appears to mean the mountain Moriah, on which thetemple was built, where the incense was burned, and the peopleworshipped the Lord. This was his residence till the shadows of the lawgiven to Moses were dispersed by the breaking of the gospel day, andthe rising of the Sun of righteousness. And though, in respect of hishuman nature, Christ is absent from his church on earth, and willcontinue to be so till the heavenly day break, yet he is spirituallypresent in his ordinances, and with his people. How fair and comely arebelievers, when justified in Christ's righteousness, and adorned withspiritual graces! when their thoughts, words, and deeds, thoughimperfect, are pure, manifesting a heart nourished by the gospel!<br>Song 4:8-15 Observe the gracious call Christ gives to the church. Itis, 1. A precept; so this is Christ's call to his church to come offfrom the world. These hills seem pleasant, but there are in them lions'dens; they are mountains of the leopards. 2. As a promise; many shallbe brought as members of the church, from every point. The church shallbe delivered from her persecutors in due time, though now she dwellsamong lions, Ps. 57:4. Christ's heart is upon his church; his treasureis therein; and he delights in the affection she has for him; itsworking in the heart, and its works in the life. The odours wherewiththe spouse is perfumed, are as the gifts and graces of the Spirit. Loveand obedience to God are more pleasing to Christ than sacrifice orincense. Christ having put upon his spouse the white raiment of his ownrighteousness, and the righteousness of saints, and perfumed it withholy joy and comfort, he is well pleased with it. And Christ walks inhis garden unseen. A hedge of protection is made around, which all thepowers of darkness cannot break through. The souls of believers are asgardens enclosed, where is a well of living water, John 4:14; 7:38, theinfluences of the Holy Spirit. The world knows not these wells ofsalvation, nor can any opposer corrupt this fountain. Saints in thechurch, and graces in the saints, are fitly compared to fruits andspices. They are planted, and do not grow of themselves. They areprecious; they are the blessings of this earth. They will be kept togood purpose when flowers are withered. Grace, when ended in glory,will last for ever. Christ is the source which makes these gardensfruitful; even a well of living waters.<br>Song 4:16 The church prays for the influences of the blessed Spirit, tomake this garden fruitful. Graces in the soul are as spices in thesegardens, that in them which is valuable and useful. The blessed Spirit,in his work upon the soul, is as the wind. There is the north wind ofconviction, and the south wind of comfort. He stirs up good affections,and works in us both to will and to do that which is good. The churchinvites Christ. Let him have the honour of all the garden produces, andlet us have the comfort of his acceptance of it. We can invite him tonothing but what is his own already. The believer can have no joy ofthe fruits, unless they redound some way or other to the glory ofChrist. Let us then seek to keep separate from the world, as a gardenenclosed, and to avoid conformity thereto.
Son 5:	<b>Overview</b><br>Christ's answer. (Song 5:1) The disappointments of the church from herown folly. (Song 5:2-8) The excellences of Christ. (Song 5:9-16)<br>Song 5:1 See how ready Christ is to accept the invitations of hispeople. What little good there is in us would be lost, if he did notpreserve it to himself. He also invites his beloved people to eat anddrink abundantly. The ordinances in which they honour him, are means ofgrace.<br>Song 5:2-8 Churches and believers, by carelessness and security,provoke Christ to withdraw. We ought to notice our spiritual slumbersand distempers. Christ knocks to awaken us, knocks by his word andSpirit, knocks by afflictions and by our consciences; thus, Rev. 3:20.When we are unmindful of Christ, still he thinks of us. Christ's loveto us should engage ours to him, even in the most self-denyinginstances; and we only can be gainers by it. Careless souls put slightson Jesus Christ. Another could not be sent to open the door. Christcalls to us, but we have no mind, or pretend we have no strength, or wehave no time, and think we may be excused. Making excuses is makinglight of Christ. Those put contempt upon Christ, who cannot find intheir hearts to bear a cold blast, or to leave a warm bed for him. Seethe powerful influences of Divine grace. He put in his hand to unboltthe door, as one weary of waiting. This betokens a work of the Spiritupon the soul. The believer's rising above self-indulgence, seeking byprayer for the consolations of Christ, and to remove every hinderanceto communion with him; these actings of the soul are represented by thehands dropping sweet-smelling myrrh upon the handles of the locks. Butthe Beloved was gone! By absenting himself, Christ will teach hispeople to value his gracious visits more highly. Observe, the soulstill calls Christ her Beloved. Every desertion is not despair. Lord, Ibelieve, though I must say, Lord, help my unbelief. His words meltedme, yet, wretch that I was, I made excuses. The smothering and stiflingof convictions will be very bitter to think of, when God opens oureyes. The soul went in pursuit of him; not only prayed, but used means,sought him in the ways wherein he used to be found. The watchmenwounded me. Some refer it to those who misapply the word to awakenedconsciences. The charge to the daughters of Jerusalem, seems to meanthe distressed believer's desire of the prayers of the feeblestChristian. Awakened souls are more sensible of Christ's withdrawingsthan of any other trouble.<br>Song 5:9-16 Even those who have little acquaintance with Christ, cannotbut see amiable beauty in others who bear his image. There are hopes ofthose who begin to inquire concerning Christ and his perfections.Christians, who are well acquainted with Christ themselves, should doall they can to make others know something of him. Divine glory makeshim truly lovely in the eyes of all who are enlightened to discernspiritual things. He is white in the spotless innocence of his life,ruddy in the bleeding sufferings he went through at his death. Thisdescription of the person of the Beloved, would form, in the figurativelanguage of those times, a portrait of beauty of person and of grace ofmanners; but the aptness of some of the allusions may not appear to us.He shall come to be glorified in his saints, and to be admired in allthat believe. May his love constrain us to live to his glory.
Son 6:	<b>Overview</b><br>Inquiry where Christ must be sought. (Song 6:1) Where Christ may befound. (Song 6:2,3) Christ's commendations of the church. (Song 6:4-10)The work of grace in the believer. (Song 6:11-13)<br>Song 6:1 Those made acquainted with the excellences of Christ, and thecomfort of an interest in him, desire to know where they may meet him.Those who would find Christ, must seek him early and diligently.<br>Song 6:2,3 Christ's church is a garden, enclosed, and separated fromthe world; he takes care of it, delights in it, and visits it. Thosewho would find Christ, must attend him in his ordinances, the word,sacraments, and prayer. When Christ comes to his church, it is toentertain his friends. And to take believers to himself: he picks thelilies one by one; and at the great day he will send forth his angelsto gather all his lilies, that he may be for ever admired in them. Thedeath of a believer is not more than the owner of a garden plucking afavourite flower; and He will preserve it from withering, yea, cause itto flourish for ever, with increasing beauty. If our own hearts canwitness for us that we are Christ's, question not his being ours, forthe covenant never breaks on his side. It is the comfort of the church,that he feeds among the lilies, that he takes delight in his people.<br>Song 6:4-10 All the real excellence and holiness on earth centre in thechurch. Christ goes forth subduing his enemies, while his followersgain victories over the world, the flesh, and the devil. He shows thetenderness of a Redeemer, the delight he takes in his redeemed people,and the workings of his own grace in them. True believers alone canpossess the beauty of holiness. And when their real character is known,it will be commended. Both the church and believers, at their firstconversion, look forth as the morning, their light being small, butincreasing. As to their sanctification, they are fair as the moon,deriving all their light, grace, and holiness from Christ; and as tojustification, clear as the sun, clothed with Christ, the Sun ofrighteousness, and fighting the good fight of faith, under the bannersof Christ, against all spiritual enemies.<br>Song 6:11-13 In retirement and in meditation the Christian character isformed and perfected. But not in the retirement of the idle, theself-indulgent, or the trifler. When the Christian is released from thedischarge of his duties in life, the world has no attractions for him.His prayer is, that all things belonging to the Spirit may live andgrow within him, and around him. Such are the interesting cares andemployments of him whom the world wrongly deems unhappy, and lost tohis true interests. In humility and self-abasement, the humbleChristian would turn away from the sight of all; but the Lord delightsto honour him. Chiefly, however, may the reference be to theministering angels who shall be sent for the soul of the Christian.Their approach may startle, but the departing soul shall find the Lordits strength and its portion for ever. The church is called theShulamite: the word signifies perfection and peace; not in herself, butin Christ, in whom she is complete, through his righteousness; and haspeace, which he made for her through his blood, and gives unto her byhis Spirit.
Son 7:	<b>Overview</b><br>The graces of the church. (Song 7:1-9) The delight of the church inChrist. (Song 7:10-13)<br>Song 7:1-9 The similitudes here are different from what they werebefore, and in the original refer to glorious and splendid clothing.Such honour have all his saints; and having put on Christ, they aredistinguished by their beautiful and glorious apparel. They adorn thedoctrine of God their Saviour in all things. Consistent believershonour Christ, recommend the gospel, and convince and awaken sinners.The church resembles the stately and spreading palm; while her love forChrist, and the obedience resulting therefrom, are precious fruit ofthe true Vine. The King is held in the galleries. Christ takes delightin the assemblies and ordinances of his people; and admires the fruitof his grace in them. When applied to the church and to each faithfulChristian, all this denotes that beauty of holiness, in which theyshall be presented to their heavenly Bridegroom.<br>Song 7:10-13 The church, the believing soul, triumphs in its relationto Christ, and interest in him. She humbly desires communion with him.Let us walk together, that I may receive counsel, instruction, andcomfort from thee; and may make known my wants and my grievances tothee, with freedom, and without interruption. Communion with Christ iswhat all that are made holy earnestly breathe after. And those whowould converse with Christ, must go forth from the world. Wherever weare, we may keep up communion with God. Nor should we go where wecannot in faith ask him to go with us. Those who would go abroad withChrist, must begin early in the morning of their days; must begin everyday with him, seek him early, seek him diligently. A gracious soul canreconcile itself to the poorest places, if it may have communion withGod in them; but the most delightful fields will not satisfy, unlessthe Beloved is there. Let us not think to be satisfied with any earthlyobject. Our own souls are our vineyards; they should be planted withuseful trees. We should often search whether we are fruitful inrighteousness. Christ's presence will make the vine flourish, and thetender grapes appear, as the returning sun revives the gardens. If wecan appeal to him, Thou knowest all things, thou knowest that I lovethee; if his Spirit witness with our spirit, that our souls prosper, itis enough. And we must beg of him to search and try us, to discover usto ourselves. The fruits and exercises of graces are pleasant to theLord Jesus. These must be laid up, and always ready; that by ourbringing forth much fruit, he may be glorified. It is all from him,therefore it is fit it should be all for him.
Son 8:	<b>Overview</b><br>Desire for communion with Christ. (Song 8:1-4) The vehemence of thisdesire. (Song 8:5-7) The church pleads for others. (Song 8:8-12) Andprays for Christ's coming. (Song 8:13,14)<br>Song 8:1-4 The church wishes for the constant intimacy and freedom withthe Lord Jesus that a sister has with a brother. That they might be ashis brethren, which they are, when by grace they are made partakers ofa Divine nature. Christ is become as our Brother; wherever we find him,let us be ready to own our relation to him, and affection for him, andnot fear being despised for it. Is there in us an ardent wish to serveChrist more and better? What then have we laid up in store, to show ouraffection to the Beloved of our souls? What fruit unto holiness? Thechurch charges all her children that they never provoke Christ towithdraw. We should reason with ourselves, when tempted to do whatwould grieve the Spirit.<br>Song 8:5-7 The Jewish church came up from the wilderness, supported byDivine power and favour. The Christian church was raised from a low,desolate condition, by the grace of Christ relied on. Believers, by thepower of grace, are brought up from the wilderness. A sinful state is awilderness in which there is no true comfort; it is a wandering,wanting state: There is no coming out of this wilderness, but leaningon Christ as our Beloved, by faith; not leaning to our ownunderstanding, nor trusting in any righteousness of our own; but in thestrength of him, who is the Lord our Righteousness. The words of thechurch to Christ which follow, entreat an abiding place in his love,and protection by his power. Set me as a seal upon thine heart; let mealways have a place in thine heart; let me have an impression of loveupon thine heart. Of this the soul would be assured, and without asense thereof no rest is to be found. Those who truly love Christ, arejealous of every thing that would draw them from him; especially ofthemselves, lest they should do any thing to provoke him to withdrawfrom them. If we love Christ, the fear of coming short of his love, orthe temptations to forsake him, will be most painful to us. No waterscan quench Christ's love to us, nor any floods drown it. Let nothingabate our love to him. Nor will life, and all its comforts, entice abeliever from loving Christ. Love of Christ, will enable us to repeland triumph over temptations from the smiles of the world, as well asfrom its frowns.<br>Song 8:8-12 The church pleads for the Gentiles, who then had not theword of God, nor the means of grace. Those who are brought to Christthemselves, should contrive what they may do to help others to him.Babes in Christ are always seen among Christians, and the welfare oftheir weak brethren is an object of continual prayer with the strongerbelievers. If the beginning of this work were likened to a wall builtupon Him the precious Foundation and Corner-stone, then the Gentilechurch would become as a palace for the great King, built of solidsilver. If the first preaching of the gospel were as the making a doorthrough the wall of partition, that door should be lasting, as casedwith boards of durable cedar. She shall be carefully and effectuallyprotected, enclosed so as to receive no damage. The church is full ofcare for those yet uncalled. Christ says, I will do all that isnecessary to be done for them. See with what satisfaction we shouldlook back upon the times and seasons, when we were in his eyes as thosethat find favour. Our hearts are our vineyards, which we must keep withall diligence. To Christ, and to his praise, all our fruits must bededicated. All that work for Christ, work for themselves, and shall beunspeakable gainers by it.<br>Song 8:13,14 These verses close the conference between Christ and hischurch. He first addresses her as dwelling in the gardens, theassemblies and ordinances of his saints. He exhorts her to be constantand frequent in prayers, supplications, and praises, in which hedelights. She replies, craving his speedy return to take her to bewholly with Him. The heavens, those high mountains of sweet spices,must contain Christ, till the times come, when every eye shall see him,in all the glory of the better world. True believers as they arelooking for, so they are hastening to the coming of that day of theLord. Let every Christian endeavour to perform the duties of hisstation, that men may see his good works, and glorify his heavenlyFather. Continuing earnest in prayer for what we want, ourthanksgivings will abound, and our joy will be full; our souls will beenriched, and our labours prospered. We shall be enabled to lookforward to death and judgment without fear. Even so, come, Lord Jesus.
Isa 1:	<b>Overview</b><br>The corruptions prevailing among the Jews. (Is. 1:1-9) Severe censures.(Is. 1:10-15) Exhortations to repentance. (Is. 1:16-20) The state ofJudah is lamented; with gracious promises of the gospel times. (Is.1:21-31)<br>Is. 1:1-9 Isaiah signifies, "The salvation of the Lord;" a verysuitable name for this prophet, who prophesies so much of Jesus theSaviour, and his salvation. God's professing people did not know orconsider that they owed their lives and comforts to God's fatherly careand kindness. How many are very careless in the affairs of their souls!Not considering what we do know in religion, does us as much harm, asignorance of what we should know. The wickedness was universal. Here isa comparison taken from a sick and diseased body. The distemperthreatens to be mortal. From the sole of the foot even to the head;from the meanest peasant to the greatest peer, there is no soundness,no good principle, no religion, for that is the health of the soul.Nothing but guilt and corruption; the sad effects of Adam's fall. Thispassage declares the total depravity of human nature. While sin remainsunrepented, nothing is done toward healing these wounds, and preventingfatal effects. Jerusalem was exposed and unprotected, like the huts orsheds built up to guard ripening fruits. These are still to be seen inthe East, where fruits form a large part of the summer food of thepeople. But the Lord had a small remnant of pious servants atJerusalem. It is of the Lord's mercies that we are not consumed. Theevil nature is in every one of us; only Jesus and his sanctifyingSpirit can restore us to spiritual health.<br>Is. 1:10-15 Judea was desolate, and their cities burned. This awakenedthem to bring sacrifices and offerings, as if they would bribe God toremove the punishment, and give them leave to go on in their sin. Manywho will readily part with their sacrifices, will not be persuaded topart with their sins. They relied on the mere form as a servicedeserving a reward. The most costly devotions of wicked people, withoutthorough reformation of heart and life, cannot be acceptable to God. Henot only did not accept them, but he abhorred them. All this shows thatsin is very hateful to God. If we allow ourselves in secret sin, orforbidden indulgences; if we reject the salvation of Christ, our veryprayers will become abomination.<br>Is. 1:16-20 Not only feel sorrow for the sin committed, but break offthe practice. We must be doing, not stand idle. We must be doing thegood the Lord our God requires. It is plain that the sacrifices of thelaw could not atone, even for outward national crimes. But, blessed beGod, there is a Fountain opened, in which sinners of every age and rankmay be cleansed. Though our sins have been as scarlet and crimson, adeep dye, a double dye, first in the wool of original corruption, andafterwards in the many threads of actual transgression; though we haveoften dipped into sin, by many backslidings; yet pardoning mercy willtake out the stain, Ps. 51:7. They should have all the happiness andcomfort they could desire. Life and death, good and evil, are setbefore us. O Lord, incline all of us to live to thy glory.<br>Is. 1:21-31 Neither holy cities nor royal ones are faithful to theirtrust, if religion does not dwell in them. Dross may shine like silver,and the wine that is mixed with water may still have the colour ofwine. Those have a great deal to answer for, who do not help theoppressed, but oppress them. Men may do much by outward restraints; butonly God works effectually by the influences of his Spirit, as a Spiritof Judgment. Sin is the worst captivity, the worst slavery. Theredemption of the spiritual Zion, by the righteousness and death ofChrist, and by his powerful grace, most fully accord with what is heremeant. Utter ruin is threatened. The Jews should become as a tree whenblasted by heat; as a garden without water, which in those hotcountries would soon be burned up. Thus shall they be that trust inidols, or in an arm of flesh. Even the strong man shall be as tow; notonly soon broken, and pulled to pieces, but easily catching fire. Whenthe sinner has made himself as tow and stubble, and God makes himselfas a consuming fire, what can prevent the utter ruin of the sinner?
Isa 2:	<b>Overview</b><br>The conversion of the Gentiles, Description of the sinfulness ofIsrael. (Is. 2:1-9) The awful punishment of unbelievers. (Is. 2:10-22)<br>Is. 2:1-9 The calling of the Gentiles, the spread of the gospel, andthat far more extensive preaching of it yet to come, are foretold. LetChristians strengthen one another, and support one another. It is Godwho teaches his people, by his word and Spirit. Christ promotes peace,as well as holiness. If all men were real Christians, there could be nowar; but nothing answering to these expressions has yet taken place onthe earth. Whatever others do, let us walk in the light of this peace.Let us remember that when true religion flourishes, men delight ingoing up to the house of the Lord, and in urging others to accompanythem. Those are in danger who please themselves with strangers to God;for we soon learn to follow the ways of persons whose company we keep.It is not having silver and gold, horses and chariots, that displeasesGod, but depending upon them, as if we could not be safe, and easy, andhappy without them, and could not but be so with them. Sin is adisgrace to the poorest and the lowest. And though lands calledChristian are not full of idols, in the literal sense, are they notfull of idolized riches? and are not men so busy about their gains andindulgences, that the Lord, his truths, and precepts, are forgotten ordespised?<br>Is. 2:10-22 The taking of Jerusalem by the Chaldeans seems first meanthere, when idolatry among the Jews was done away; but our thoughts areled forward to the destruction of all the enemies of Christ. It isfolly for those who are pursued by the wrath of God, to think to hideor shelter themselves from it. The shaking of the earth will beterrible to those who set their affections on things of the earth.Men's haughtiness will be brought down, either by the grace of Godconvincing them of the evil of pride, or by the providence of Goddepriving them of all the things they were proud of. The day of theLord shall be upon those things in which they put their confidence.Those who will not be reasoned out of their sins, sooner or later shallbe frightened out of them. Covetous men make money their god; but thetime will come when they will feel it as much their burden. This wholepassage may be applied to the case of an awakened sinner, ready toleave all that his soul may be saved. The Jews were prone to rely ontheir heathen neighbours; but they are here called upon to cease fromdepending on mortal man. We are all prone to the same sin. Then let notman be your fear, let not him be your hope; but let your hope be in theLord your God. Let us make this our great concern.
Isa 3:	<b>Overview</b><br>The calamities about to come upon the land. (Is. 3:1-9) The wickednessof the people. (Is. 3:10-15) The distress of the proud, luxurious womenof Zion. (Is. 3:16-26)<br>Is. 3:1-9 God was about to deprive Judah of every stay and support. Thecity and the land were to be made desolate, because their words andworks had been rebellious against the Lord; even at his holy temple. Ifmen do not stay themselves upon God, he will soon remove all othersupports, and then they must sink. Christ is the Bread of life and theWater of life; if he be our Stay, we shall find that is a good part notto be taken away, John 6:27. Here note, 1. That the condition ofsinners is exceedingly woful. 2. It is the soul that is damaged by sin.3. Whatever evil befals sinners, be sure that they bring it onthemselves.<br>Is. 3:10-15 The rule was certain; however there might be nationalprosperity or trouble, it would be well with the righteous and ill withthe wicked. Blessed be God, there is abundant encouragement to therighteous to trust in him, and for sinners to repent and return to him.It was time for the Lord to show his might. He will call men to astrict account for all the wealth and power intrusted to and abused bythem. If it is sinful to disregard the necessities of the poor, howodious and wicked a part do they act, who bring men into poverty, andthen oppress them!<br>Is. 3:16-26 The prophet reproves and warns the daughters of Zion of thesufferings coming upon them. Let them know that God notices the follyand vanity of proud women, even of their dress. The punishmentsthreatened answered the sin. Loathsome diseases often are the justpunishment of pride. It is not material to ask what sort of ornamentsthey wore; many of these things, if they had not been in fashion, wouldhave been ridiculed then as now. Their fashions differed much fromthose of our times, but human nature is the same. Wasting time andmoney, to the neglect of piety, charity, and even of justice, displeasethe Lord. Many professors at the present day, seem to think there is noharm in worldly finery; but were it not a great evil, would the HolySpirit have taught the prophet to expose it so fully? The Jews beingovercome, Jerusalem would be levelled with the ground; which isrepresented under the idea of a desolate female seated upon the earth.And when the Romans had destroyed Jerusalem, they struck a medal, onwhich was represented a woman sitting on the ground in a posture ofgrief. If sin be harboured within the walls, lamentation and mourningare near the gates.
Isa 4:	<b>Overview</b><br>The havoc occasioned by war. (Is. 4:1) The times of the Messiah. (Is.4:2-6)<br>Is. 4:1 This first verse belongs to the third chapter.

Christ is called the Branch of the Lord, beingplanted by his power, and flourishing to his praise. The gospel is thefruit of the Branch of the Lord; all the graces and comforts of thegospel spring from Christ. It is called the fruit of the earth, becauseit sprang up in this world, and was suited for the present state. Itwill be good evidence that we are distinguished from those merelycalled Israel, if we are brought to see all beauty in Christ, andholiness. As a type of this blessed day, Jerusalem should againflourish as a branch, and be blessed with the fruits of the earth. Godwill keep for himself a holy seed. When most of those that have a placeand a name in Zion, and in Jerusalem, shall be cut off by theirunbelief, some shall be left. Those only that are holy shall be left,when the Son of man shall gather out of his kingdom every thing whichoffends. By the judgment of God's providence, sinners were destroyedand consumed; but by the Spirit of grace they are reformed andconverted. The Spirit herein acts as a Spirit of judgment, enlighteningthe mind, convincing the conscience; also as a Spirit of burning,quickening and strengthening the affections, and making men zealouslyaffected in a good work. An ardent love to Christ and souls, and zealagainst sin, will carry men on with resolution in endeavours to turnaway ungodliness from Jacob. Every affliction serves believers as afurnace, to purify them from dross; and the convincing, enlightening,and powerful influences of the Holy Spirit, gradually root out theirlusts, and render them holy as He is holy. God will protect his church,and all that belong to it. Gospel truths and ordinances are the gloryof the church. Grace in the soul is the glory of it; and those thathave it are kept by the power of God. But only those who are weary willseek rest; only those who are convinced that a storm is approaching,will look for shelter. Affected with a deep sense of the Divinedispleasure, to which we are exposed by sin, let us at once haverecourse to Jesus Christ, and thankfully accept the refuge he affords.
Isa 5:	<b>Overview</b><br>The state and conduct of the Jewish nation. (Is. 5:1-7) The judgmentswhich would come. (Is. 5:8-23) The executioners of these judgments.(Is. 5:24-30)<br>Is. 5:1-7 Christ is God's beloved Son, and our beloved Saviour. Thecare of the Lord over the church of Israel, is described by themanagement of a vineyard. The advantages of our situation will bebrought into the account another day. He planted it with the choicestvines; gave them a most excellent law, instituted proper ordinances.The temple was a tower, where God gave tokens of his presence. He setup his altar, to which the sacrifices should be brought; all the meansof grace are denoted thereby. God expects fruit from those that enjoyprivileges. Good purposes and good beginnings are good things, but notenough; there must be vineyard fruit; thoughts and affections, wordsand actions, agreeable to the Spirit. It brought forth bad fruit. Wildgrapes are the fruits of the corrupt nature. Where grace does not work,corruption will. But the wickedness of those that profess religion, andenjoy the means of grace, must be upon the sinners themselves. Theyshall no longer be a peculiar people. When errors and vice go withoutcheck or control, the vineyard is unpruned; then it will soon be grownover with thorns. This is often shown in the departure of God's Spiritfrom those who have long striven against him, and the removal of hisgospel from places which have long been a reproach to it. Theexplanation is given. It is sad with a soul, when, instead of thegrapes of humility, meekness, love, patience, and contempt of theworld, for which God looks, there are the wild grapes of pride,passion, discontent, and malice, and contempt of God; instead of thegrapes of praying and praising, the wild grapes of cursing andswearing. Let us bring forth fruit with patience, that in the end wemay obtain everlasting life.<br>Is. 5:8-23 Here is a woe to those who set their hearts on the wealth ofthe world. Not that it is sinful for those who have a house and a fieldto purchase another; but the fault is, that they never know when theyhave enough. Covetousness is idolatry; and while many envy theprosperous, wretched man, the Lord denounces awful woes upon him. Howapplicable to many among us! God has many ways to empty the mostpopulous cities. Those who set their hearts upon the world, will justlybe disappointed. Here is woe to those who dote upon the pleasures andthe delights of sense. The use of music is lawful; but when it drawsaway the heart from God, then it becomes a sin to us. God's judgmentshave seized them, but they will not disturb themselves in theirpleasures. The judgments are declared. Let a man be ever so high, deathwill bring him low; ever so mean, death will bring him lower. The fruitof these judgments shall be, that God will be glorified as a God ofpower. Also, as a God that is holy; he shall be owned and declared tobe so, in the righteous punishment of proud men. Those are in a wofulcondition who set up sin, and who exert themselves to gratify theirbase lusts. They are daring in sin, and walk after their own lusts; itis in scorn that they call God the Holy One of Israel. They confoundand overthrow distinctions between good and evil. They prefer their ownreasonings to Divine revelations; their own devices to the counsels andcommands of God. They deem it prudent and politic to continueprofitable sins, and to neglect self-denying duties. Also, how lightsoever men make of drunkenness, it is a sin which lays open to thewrath and curse of God. Their judges perverted justice. Every sin needssome other to conceal it.<br>Is. 5:24-30 Let not any expect to live easily who live wickedly. Sinweakens the strength, the root of a people; it defaces the beauty, theblossoms of a people. When God's word is despised, and his law castaway, what can men expect but that God should utterly abandon them?When God comes forth in wrath, the hills tremble, fear seizes evengreat men. When God designs the ruin of a provoking people, he can findinstruments to be employed in it, as he sent for the Chaldeans, andafterwards the Romans, to destroy the Jews. Those who would not hearthe voice of God speaking by his prophets, shall hear the voice oftheir enemies roaring against them. Let the distressed look which waythey will, all appears dismal. If God frowns upon us, how can anycreature smile? Let us diligently seek the well-grounded assurance,that when all earthly helps and comforts shall fail, God himself willbe the strength of our hearts, and our portion for ever.
Isa 6:	<b>Overview</b><br>The vision which Isaiah beheld in the temple. (Is. 6:1-8) The Lorddeclares the blindness to come upon the Jewish nation, and thedestruction which would follow. (Is. 6:9-13)<br>Is. 6:1-8 In this figurative vision, the temple is thrown open to view,even to the most holy place. The prophet, standing outside the temple,sees the Divine Presence seated on the mercy-seat, raised over the arkof the covenant, between the cherubim and seraphim, and the Divineglory filled the whole temple. See God upon his throne. This vision isexplained, John 12:41, that Isaiah now saw Christ's glory, and spake ofHim, which is a full proof that our Saviour is God. In Christ Jesus,God is seated on a throne of grace; and through him the way into theholiest is laid open. See God's temple, his church on earth, filledwith his glory. His train, the skirts of his robes, filled the temple,the whole world, for it is all God's temple. And yet he dwells in everycontrite heart. See the blessed attendants by whom his government isserved. Above the throne stood the holy angels, called seraphim, whichmeans "burners;" they burn in love to God, and zeal for his gloryagainst sin. The seraphim showing their faces veiled, declares thatthey are ready to yield obedience to all God's commands, though they donot understand the secret reasons of his counsels, government, orpromises. All vain-glory, ambition, ignorance, and pride, would be doneaway by one view of Christ in his glory. This awful vision of theDivine Majesty overwhelmed the prophet with a sense of his ownvileness. We are undone if there is not a Mediator between us and thisholy God. A glimpse of heavenly glory is enough to convince us that allour righteousnesses are as filthy rags. Nor is there a man that woulddare to speak to the Lord, if he saw the justice, holiness, and majestyof God, without discerning his glorious mercy and grace in JesusChrist. The live coal may denote the assurance given to the prophet, ofpardon, and acceptance in his work, through the atonement of Christ.Nothing is powerful to cleanse and comfort the soul, but what is takenfrom Christ's satisfaction and intercession. The taking away sin isnecessary to our speaking with confidence and comfort, either to God inprayer, or from God in preaching; and those shall have their sin takenaway who complain of it as a burden, and see themselves in danger ofbeing undone by it. It is great comfort to those whom God sends, thatthey go for God, and may therefore speak in his name, assured that hewill bear them out.<br>Is. 6:9-13 God sends Isaiah to foretell the ruin of his people. Manyhear the sound of God's word, but do not feel the power of it. Godsometimes, in righteous judgment, gives men up to blindness of mind,because they will not receive the truth in the love of it. But nohumble inquirer after Christ, need to fear this awful doom, which is aspiritual judgment on those who will still hold fast their sins. Letevery one pray for the enlightening of the Holy Spirit, that he mayperceive how precious are the Divine mercies, by which alone we aresecured against this dreadful danger. Yet the Lord would preserve aremnant, like the tenth, holy to him. And blessed be God, he stillpreserves his church; however professors or visible churches may belopped off as unfruitful, the holy seed will shoot forth, from whom allthe numerous branches of righteousness shall arise.
Isa 7:	<b>Overview</b><br>Ahaz threatened by Israel and Syria; and is assured their attack wouldbe in vain. (Is. 7:1-9) God gives a sure sign by the promise of thelong-expected Messiah. (Is. 7:10-16) The folly and sin of seekingrelief from Assyria are reproved. (Is. 7:17-25)<br>Is. 7:1-9 Ungodly men are often punished by others as bad asthemselves. Being in great distress and confusion, the Jews gave up allfor lost. They had made God their enemy, and knew not how to make himtheir friend. The prophet must teach them to despise their enemies, infaith and dependence on God. Ahaz, in fear, called them two powerfulprinces. No, says the prophet, they are but tails of smokingfirebrands, burnt out already. The two kingdoms of Syria and Israelwere nearly expiring. While God has work for the firebrands of theearth, they consume all before them; but when their work is fulfilled,they will be extinguished in smoke. That which Ahaz thought mostformidable, is made the ground of their defeat; because they have takenevil counsel against thee; which is an offence to God. God scorns thescorners, and gives his word that the attempt should not succeed. Manpurposes, but God disposes. It was folly for those to be trying to ruintheir neighbours, who were themselves near to ruin. Isaiah must urgethe Jews to rely on the assurances given them. Faith is absolutelynecessary to quiet and compose the mind in trials.<br>Is. 7:10-16 Secret disaffection to God is often disguised with thecolour of respect to him; and those who are resolved that they will nottrust God, yet pretend they will not tempt him. The prophet reprovedAhaz and his court, for the little value they had for Divinerevelation. Nothing is more grievous to God than distrust, but theunbelief of man shall not make the promise of God of no effect; theLord himself shall give a sign. How great soever your distress anddanger, of you the Messiah is to be born, and you cannot be destroyedwhile that blessing is in you. It shall be brought to pass in aglorious manner; and the strongest consolations in time of trouble arederived from Christ, our relation to him, our interest in him, ourexpectations of him and from him. He would grow up like other children,by the use of the diet of those countries; but he would, unlike otherchildren, uniformly refuse the evil and choose the good. And althoughhis birth would be by the power of the Holy Ghost, yet he should not befed with angels' food. Then follows a sign of the speedy destruction ofthe princes, now a terror to Judah. "Before this child," so it may beread; "this child which I have now in my arms," (Shear-jashub, theprophet's own son, Is. 7:3,) shall be three or four years older, theseenemies' forces shall be forsaken of both their kings. The prophecy isso solemn, the sign is so marked, as given by God himself after Ahazrejected the offer, that it must have raised hopes far beyond what thepresent occasion suggested. And, if the prospect of the coming of theDivine Saviour was a never-failing support to the hopes of ancientbelievers, what cause have we to be thankful that the Word was madeflesh! May we trust in and love Him, and copy his example.<br>Is. 7:17-25 Let those who will not believe the promises of God, expectto hear the alarms of his threatenings; for who can resist or escapehis judgments? The Lord shall sweep all away; and whomsoever he employsin any service for him, he will pay. All speaks a sad change of theface of that pleasant land. But what melancholy change is there, whichsin will not make with a people? Agriculture would cease. Sorrows ofevery kind will come upon all who neglect the great salvation. If weremain unfruitful under the means of grace, the Lord will say, Let nofruit grow on thee henceforth for ever.
Isa 8:	<b>Overview</b><br>Exhortations and warnings. (Is. 8:1-8) Comfort for those who fear God.(Is. 8:9-16) Afflictions to idolaters. (Is. 8:17-22)<br>Is. 8:1-8 The prophet is to write on a large roll, or on a metaltablet, words which meant, "Make speed to spoil, hasten to the prey:"pointing out that the Assyrian army should come with speed, and makegreat spoil. Very soon the riches of Damascus and of Samaria, citiesthen secure and formidable, shall be taken away by the king of Assyria.The prophet pleads with the promised Messiah, who should appear in thatland in the fulness of time, and, therefore, as God, would preserve itin the mean time. As a gentle brook is an apt emblem of a mildgovernment, so an overflowing torrent represents a conqueror andtyrant. The invader's success was also described by a bird of prey,stretching its wings over the whole land. Those who reject Christ, willfind that what they call liberty is the basest slavery. But no enemyshall pluck the believer out of Emmanuel's hand, or deprive him of hisheavenly inheritance.<br>Is. 8:9-16 The prophet challenges the enemies of the Jews. Theirefforts would be vain, and themselves broken to pieces. It concerns us,in time of trouble, to watch against all such fears as put us uponcrooked courses for our own security. The believing fear of Godpreserves against the disquieting fear of man. If we thought rightly ofthe greatness and glory of God, we should see all the power of ourenemies restrained. The Lord, who will be a Sanctuary to those whotrust in him, will be a Stone of stumbling, and a Rock of offence, tothose who make the creature their fear and their hope. If the things ofGod be an offence to us, they will undo us. The apostle quotes this asto all who persisted in unbelief of the gospel of Christ, I Pet. 2:8.The crucified Emmanuel, who was and is a Stumbling-stone and Rock ofoffence to unbelieving Jews, is no less so to thousands who are calledChristians. The preaching of the cross is foolishness in their esteem;his doctrines and precepts offend them.<br>Is. 8:17-22 The prophet foresaw that the Lord would hide his face; buthe would look for his return in favour to them again. Though notmiraculous signs, the children's names were memorials from God, suitedto excite attention. The unbelieving Jews were prone to seek counsel indifficulties, from diviners of different descriptions, whose foolishand sinful ceremonies are alluded to. Would we know how we may seek toour God, and come to the knowledge of his mind? To the law and to thetestimony; for there you will see what is good, and what the Lordrequires. We must speak of the things of God in the words which theHoly Ghost teaches, and be ruled by them. To those that seek tofamiliar spirits, and regard not God's law and testimony, there shallbe horror and misery. Those that go away from God, go out of the way ofall good; for fretfulness is a sin that is its own punishment. Theyshall despair, and see no way of relief, when they curse God. And theirfears will represent every thing as frightful. Those that shut theireyes against the light of God's word, will justly be left to darkness.All the miseries that ever were felt or witnessed on earth, are asnothing, compared with what will overwhelm those who leave the words ofChrist, to follow delusions.
Isa 9:	<b>Overview</b><br>The Son that should be born, and his kingdom. (Is. 9:1-7) The judgmentsto come upon Israel, and on the enemies of the kingdom of Christ. (Is.9:8-21)<br>Is. 9:1-7 The Syrians and Assyrians first ravaged the countries herementioned, and that region was first favoured by the preaching ofChrist. Those that want the gospel, walk in darkness, and in the utmostdanger. But when the gospel comes to any place, to any soul, lightcomes. Let us earnestly pray that it may shine into our hearts, andmake us wise unto salvation. The gospel brings joy with it. Those whowould have joy, must expect to go through hard work, as the husbandman,before he has the joy of harvest; and hard conflict, as the soldier,before he divides the spoil. The Jews were delivered from the yoke ofmany oppressors; this was a shadow of the believer's deliverance fromthe yoke of Satan. The cleansing the souls of believers from the powerand pollution of sin, would be by the influence of the Holy Spirit, aspurifying fire. These great things for the church, shall be done by theMessiah, Emmanuel. The Child is born; it was certain; and the church,before Christ came in the flesh, benefitted by his undertaking. It is aprophecy of him and of his kingdom, which those that waited for theConsolation of Israel read with pleasure. This Child was born for thebenefit of us men, of us sinners, of all believers, from the beginningto the end of the world. Justly is he called Wonderful, for he is bothGod and man. His love is the wonder of angels and glorified saints. Heis the Counsellor, for he knew the counsels of God from eternity; andhe gives counsel to men, in which he consults our welfare. He is theWonderful Counsellor; none teaches like him. He is God, the mighty One.Such is the work of the Mediator, that no less power than that of themighty God could bring it to pass. He is God, one with the Father. Asthe Prince of Peace, he reconciles us to God; he is the Giver of peacein the heart and conscience; and when his kingdom is fully established,men shall learn war no more. The government shall be upon him; he shallbear the burden of it. Glorious things are spoken of Christ'sgovernment. There is no end to the increase of its peace, for thehappiness of its subjects shall last for ever. The exact agreement ofthis prophecy with the doctrine of the New Testament, shows that Jewishprophets and Christian teachers had the same view of the person andsalvation of the Messiah. To what earthly king or kingdom can thesewords apply? Give then, O Lord, to thy people to know thee by everyendearing name, and in every glorious character. Give increase of gracein every heart of thy redeemed upon earth.<br>Is. 9:8-21 Those are ripening apace for ruin, whose hearts areunhumbled under humbling providences. For that which God designs, insmiting us, is, to turn us to himself; and if this point be not gainedby lesser judgments, greater may be expected. The leaders of the peoplemisled them. We have reason to be afraid of those that speak well ofus, when we do ill. Wickedness was universal, all were infected withit. They shall be in trouble, and see no way out; and when men's waysdisplease the Lord, he makes even their friends to be at war with them.God would take away those they thought to have help from. Their rulerswere the head. Their false prophets were the tail and the rush, themost despicable. In these civil contests, men preyed on near relationswho were as their own flesh. The people turn not to Him who smitesthem, therefore he continues to smite: for when God judges, he willovercome; and the proudest, stoutest sinner shall either bend or break.
Isa 10:	<b>Overview</b><br>Woes against proud oppressors. (Is. 10:1-4) The Assyrian but aninstrument in the hand of God for the punishment of his people. (Is.10:5-19) The deliverance from him. (Is. 10:20-34)<br>Is. 10:1-4 These verses are to be joined with the foregoing chapter.Woe to the superior powers that devise and decree unrighteous decrees!And woe to the inferior officers that draw them up, and enter them onrecord! But what will sinners do? Whither will they flee?<br>Is. 10:5-19 See what a change sin made. The king of Assyria, in hispride, thought to act by his own will. The tyrants of the world aretools of Providence. God designs to correct his people for theirhypocrisy, and bring them nearer to him; but is that Sennacherib'sdesign? No; he designs to gratify his own covetousness and ambition.The Assyrian boasts what great things he has done to other nations, byhis own policy and power. He knows not that it is God who makes himwhat he is, and puts the staff into his hand. He had done all this withease; none moved the wing, or cried as birds do when their nests arerifled. Because he conquered Samaria, he thinks Jerusalem would fall ofcourse. It was lamentable that Jerusalem should have set up gravenimages, and we cannot wonder that she was excelled in them by theheathen. But is it not equally foolish for Christians to emulate thepeople of the world in vanities, instead of keeping to things which aretheir special honour? For a tool to boast, or to strive against himthat formed it, would not be more out of the way, than for Sennacheribto vaunt himself against Jehovah. When God brings his people intotrouble, it is to bring sin to their remembrance, and humble them, andto awaken them to a sense of their duty; this must be the fruit, eventhe taking away of sin. When these points are gained by the affliction,it shall be removed in mercy. This attempt upon Zion and Jerusalemshould come to nothing. God will be as a fire to consume the workers ofiniquity, both soul and body. The desolation should be as when astandard-bearer fainteth, and those who follow are put to confusion.Who is able to stand before this great and holy Lord God?<br>Is. 10:20-34 By our afflictions we may learn not to make creatures ourconfidence. Those only can with comfort stay upon God, who return tohim in truth, not in pretence and profession only. God will justlybring this wasting away on a provoking people, but will graciously setbounds to it. It is against the mind and will of God, that his people,whatever happens, should give way to fear. God's anger against hispeople is but for a moment; and when that is turned from us, we neednot fear the fury of man. The rod with which he corrected his people,shall not only be laid aside, but thrown into the fire. To encourageGod's people, the prophet puts them in mind of what God had formerlydone against the enemies of his church. God's people shall be deliveredfrom the Assyrians. Some think it looks to the deliverance of the Jewsout of their captivity; and further yet, to the redemption of believersfrom the tyranny of sin and Satan. And this, "because of theanointing;" for his people Israel's sake, the believers among them thathad received the unction of Divine grace. And for the sake of theMessiah, the Anointed of God. Here is, Is. 10:28-34, a propheticaldescription of Sennacherib's march towards Jerusalem, when hethreatened to destroy that city. Then the Lord, in whom Hezekiahtrusted, cut down his army like the hewing of a forest. Let us applywhat is here written, to like matters in other ages of the church ofChrist. Because of the anointing of our great Redeemer, the yoke ofevery antichrist must be broken from off his church: and if our soulspartake of the unction of the Holy Spirit, complete and eternaldeliverances will be secured to us.
Isa 11:	<b>Overview</b><br>The peaceful character of Christ's kingdom and subjects. (Is. 11:1-9)The conversion of the Gentiles and Jews. (Is. 11:10-16)<br>Is. 11:1-9 The Messiah is called a Rod, and a Branch. The words signifya small, tender product; a shoot, such as is easily broken off. Hecomes forth out of the stem of Jesse; when the royal family was cutdown and almost levelled with the ground, it would sprout again. Thehouse of David was brought very low at the time of Christ's birth. TheMessiah thus gave early notice that his kingdom was not of this world.But the Holy Spirit, in all his gifts and graces, shall rest and abideupon him; he shall have the fulness of the Godhead dwelling in him,Col. 1:19; 2:9. Many consider that seven gifts of the Holy Spirit arehere mentioned. And the doctrine of the influences of the Holy Spiritis here clearly taught. The Messiah would be just and righteous in allhis government. His threatening shall be executed by the working of hisSpirit according to his word. There shall be great peace and quietunder his government. The gospel changes the nature, and makes thosewho trampled on the meek of the earth, meek like them, and kind tothem. But it shall be more fully shown in the latter days. Also Christ,the great Shepherd, shall take care of his flock, that the nature oftroubles, and of death itself, shall be so changed, that they shall notdo any real hurt. God's people shall be delivered, not only from evil,but from the fear of it. Who shall separate us from the love of Christ?The better we know the God of love, the more shall we be changed intothe same likeness, and the better disposed to all who have any likenessto him. This knowledge shall extend as the sea, so far shall it spread.And this blessed power there have been witnesses in every age ofChristianity, though its most glorious time, here foretold, is not yetarrived. Meanwhile let us aim that our example and endeavours may helpto promote the honour of Christ and his kingdom of peace.<br>Is. 11:10-16 When the gospel should be publicly preached, the Gentileswould seek Christ Jesus as their Lord and Saviour, and find rest ofsoul. When God's time is come for the deliverance of his people,mountains of opposition shall become plains before him. God can soonturn gloomy days into glorious ones. And while we expect the Lord togather his ancient people, and bring them home to his church, also tobring in the fulness of the Gentiles, when all will be united in holylove, let us tread the highway of holiness he has made for hisredeemed. Let us wait for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ untoeternal life, looking to him to prepare our way through death, thatriver which separates this world from the eternal world.
Isa 12:	<b>Overview</b><br>This is a hymn of praise suited to the times of the Messiah.<br>The song of praise in this chapter is suitable for the return of theoutcasts of Israel from their long captivity, but it is especiallysuitable to the case of a sinner, when he first finds peace and joy inbelieving; to that of a believer, when his peace is renewed aftercorrections for backslidings; and to that of the whole company of theredeemed, when they meet before the throne of God in heaven. Thepromise is sure, and the blessings contained in it are very rich; andthe benefits enjoyed through Jesus Christ, call for the most enlargedthanksgivings. By Jesus Christ, the Root of Jesse, the Divine angeragainst mankind was turned away, for he is our Peace. Those to whom Godis reconciled, he comforts. They are taught to triumph in God and theirinterest in him. I will trust him to prepare me for his salvation, andpreserve me to it. I will trust him with all my concerns, not doubtingbut he will make all to work for good. Faith in God is a sovereignremedy against tormenting fears. Many Christians have God for theirstrength, who have him not for their song; they walk in darkness: butthose who have God for their strength ought to make him their song;that is, give him the glory of it, and take to themselves the comfortof it. This salvation is from the love of God the Father, it comes tous through God the Son, it is applied by the new-creating power of Godthe Spirit. When this is seen by faith, the trembling sinner learns tohope in God, and is delivered from fear. The purifying and sanctifyinginfluences of the Holy Ghost often are denoted under the emblem ofspringing water. This work flows through the mediation of Christ, andis conveyed to our souls by means of God's ordinances. Blessed be God,we have wells of salvation opened on every side, and may draw from themthe waters of life and consolation. In the second part of this gospelsong, Is. 12:4-6, believers encourage one another to praise God, andseek to draw others to join them in it. No difference of opinions aboutthe times and seasons, and other such matters, ought to divide thehearts of Christians. Let it be our care that we may be placed amongstthose to whom he will say, Come, ye blessed of my Father, receive thekingdom prepared for you from the beginning of the world.
Isa 13:	<b>Overview</b><br>The armies of God's wrath. (Is. 13:1-5) The conquest of Babylon. (Is.13:6-18) Its final desolation. (Is. 13:19-22)<br>Is. 13:1-5 The threatenings of God's word press heavily upon thewicked, and are a sore burden, too heavy for them to bear. The personsbrought together to lay Babylon waste, are called God's sanctified orappointed ones; designed for this service, and made able to do it. Theyare called God's mighty ones, because they had their might from God,and were now to use it for him. They come from afar. God can make thosea scourge and ruin to his enemies, who are farthest off, and thereforeleast dreaded.<br>Is. 13:6-18 We have here the terrible desolation of Babylon by theMedes and Persians. Those who in the day of their peace were proud, andhaughty, and terrible, are quite dispirited when trouble comes. Theirfaces shall be scorched with the flame. All comfort and hope shallfail. The stars of heaven shall not give their light, the sun shall bedarkened. Such expressions are often employed by the prophets, todescribe the convulsions of governments. God will visit them for theiriniquity, particularly the sin of pride, which brings men low. Thereshall be a general scene of horror. Those who join themselves toBabylon, must expect to share her plagues, Rev. 18:4. All that menhave, they would give for their lives, but no man's riches shall be theransom of his life. Pause here and wonder that men should be thus crueland inhuman, and see how corrupt the nature of man is become. And thatlittle infants thus suffer, which shows that there is an originalguilt, by which life is forfeited as soon as it is begun. The day ofthe Lord will, indeed, be terrible with wrath and fierce anger, farbeyond all here stated. Nor will there be any place for the sinner toflee to, or attempt an escape. But few act as though they believedthese things.<br>Is. 13:19-22 Babylon was a noble city; yet it should be whollydestroyed. None shall dwell there. It shall be a haunt for wild beasts.All this is fulfilled. The fate of this proud city is a proof of thetruth of the Bible, and an emblem of the approaching ruin of the NewTestament Babylon; a warning to sinners to flee from the wrath to come,and it encourages believers to expect victory over every enemy of theirsouls, and of the church of God. The whole world changes and is liableto decay. Wherefore let us give diligence to obtain a kingdom whichcannot be moved; and in this hope let us hold fast that grace wherebywe may serve God acceptably with reverence and godly fear.
Isa 14:	<b>Overview</b><br>The destruction of Babylon, and the death of its proud monarch. (Is.14:1-23) Assurance of the destruction of Assyria. (Is. 14:24-27) Thedestruction of the Philistines. (Is. 14:28-32)<br>Is. 14:1-23 The whole plan of Divine Providence is arranged with a viewto the good of the people of God. A settlement in the land of promiseis of God's mercy. Let the church receive those whom God receives.God's people, wherever their lot is cast, should endeavour to recommendreligion by a right and winning conversation. Those that would not bereconciled to them, should be humbled by them. This may be applied tothe success of the gospel, when those were brought to obey it who hadopposed it. God himself undertakes to work a blessed change. They shallhave rest from their sorrow and fear, the sense of their presentburdens, and the dread of worse. Babylon abounded in riches. The kingof Babylon having the absolute command of so much wealth, by the helpof it ruled the nations. This refers especially to the people of theJews; and it filled up the measure of the king of Babylon's sins.Tyrants sacrifice their true interest to their lusts and passions. Itis gracious ambition to covet to be like the Most Holy, for he hassaid, Be ye holy, for I am holy; but it is sinful ambition to aim to belike the Most High, for he has said, He who exalts himself shall beabased. The devil thus drew our first parents to sin. Utter ruin shouldbe brought upon him. Those that will not cease to sin, God will make tocease. He should be slain, and go down to the grave; this is the commonfate of tyrants. True glory, that is, true grace, will go up with thesoul to heaven, but vain pomp will go down with the body to the grave;there is an end of it. To be denied burial, if for righteousness' sake,may be rejoiced in, Matt. 5:12. But if the just punishment of sin, itdenotes that impenitent sinners shall rise to everlasting shame andcontempt. Many triumphs should be in his fall. God will reckon withthose that disturb the peace of mankind. The receiving the king ofBabylon into the regions of the dead, shows there is a world ofspirits, to which the souls of men remove at death. And that souls haveconverse with each other, though we have none with them; and that deathand hell will be death and hell indeed, to all who fall unholy, fromthe height of this world's pomps, and the fulness of its pleasures.Learn from all this, that the seed of evil-doers shall never berenowned. The royal city is to be ruined and forsaken. Thus the utterdestruction of the New Testament Babylon is illustrated, Rev. 18:2.When a people will not be made clean with the besom of reformation,what can they expect but to be swept off the face of the earth with thebesom of destruction?<br>Is. 14:24-27 Let those that make themselves a yoke and a burden toGod's people, see what they are to expect. Let those that are thecalled according to God's purpose, comfort themselves, that whateverGod has purposed, it shall stand. The Lord of hosts has purposed tobreak the Assyrian's yoke; his hand is stretched out to execute thispurpose; who has power to turn it back? By such dispensations ofprovidence, the Almighty shows in the most convincing manner, that sinis hateful in his sight.<br>Is. 14:28-32 Assurance is given of the destruction of the Philistinesand their power, by famine and war. Hezekiah would be more terrible tothem than Uzziah had been. Instead of rejoicing, there would belamentation, for the whole land would be ruined. Such destruction willcome upon the proud and rebellious, but the Lord founded Zion for arefuge to poor sinners, who flee from the wrath to come, and trust inhis mercy through Christ Jesus. Let us tell all around of our comfortsand security, and exhort them to seek the same refuge and salvation.
Isa 15:	<b>Overview</b><br>The Divine judgments about to come upon the Moabites.<br>This prophecy coming to pass within three years, would confirm theprophet's mission, and the belief in all his other prophecies.Concerning Moab it is foretold, Is. 15:1. That their chief citiesshould be surprised by the enemy. Great changes, and very dismal ones,may be made in a very little time. Is. 15:2. The Moabites would haverecourse to their idols for relief. Ungodly men, when in trouble, haveno comforter. But they are seldom brought by their terrors to approachour forgiving God with true sorrow and believing prayer. Is. 15:3.There should be the cries of grief through the land. It is poor reliefto have many fellow-sufferers, fellow-mourners. Is. 15:4. The courageof their soldiers should fail. God can easily deprive a nation of thaton which it most depended for strength and defence. 5. These calamitiesshould cause grief in the neighbouring parts. Though enemies to Israel,yet as our fellow-creatures, it should be grievous to see them in suchdistress. In Is. 15:6-9, the prophet describes the woful lamentationsheard through the country of Moab, when it became a prey to theAssyrian army. The country should be plundered. And famine is usuallythe sad effect of war. Those who are eager to get abundance of thisworld, and to lay up what they have gotten, little consider how soon itmay be all taken from them. While we warn our enemies to escape fromruin, let us pray for them, that they may seek and find forgiveness oftheir sins.
Isa 16:	<b>Overview</b><br>Moab is exhorted to yield obedience. (Is. 16:1-5) The pride and thejudgments of Moab. (Is. 16:6-14)<br>Is. 16:1-5 God tells sinners what they may do to prevent ruin; so hedoes to Moab. Let them send the tribute they formerly engaged to pay toJudah. Take it as good advice. Break off thy sins by righteousness, itmay lengthen thy quiet. And this may be applied to the great gospelduty of submission to Christ. Send him the lamb, the best you have,yourselves a living sacrifice. When you come to God, the great Ruler,come in the name of the Lamb, the Lamb of God. Those who will notsubmit to Christ, shall be as a bird that wanders from her nest, whichshall be snatched up by the next bird of prey. Those who will not yieldto the fear of God, shall be made to yield to the fear of every thingelse. He advises them to be kind to the seed of Israel. Those thatexpect to find favour when in trouble themselves, must show favour tothose in trouble. What is here said concerning the throne of Hezekiah,also belongs, in a much higher sense, to the kingdom of Jesus Christ.Though by subjection to Him we may not enjoy worldly riches or honours,but may be exposed to poverty and contempt, we shall have peace ofconscience and eternal life.<br>Is. 16:6-14 Those who will not be counselled, cannot be helped. Moresouls are ruined by pride than by any other sin whatever. Also, thevery proud are commonly very passionate. With lies many seek to gainthe gratification of pride and passion, but they shall not compassproud and angry projects. Moab was famous for fields and vineyards; butthey shall be laid waste by the invading army. God can soon turnlaughter into mourning, and joy into heaviness. In God let us alwaysrejoice with holy triumph; in earthly things let us always rejoice withholy trembling. The prophet looks with concern on the desolations ofsuch a pleasant country; it causes inward grief. The false gods of Moabare unable to help; and the God of Israel, the only true God, can andwill make good what he has spoken. Let Moab know her ruin is very near,and prepare. The most awful declarations of Divine wrath, discover theway of escape to those who take warning. There is no escape, but bysubmission to the Son of David, and devoting ourselves to him. And, atlength, when the appointed time comes, all the glory, prosperity, andmultitude of the wicked shall perish.
Isa 17:	<b>Overview</b><br>Syria and Israel threatened. (Is. 17:1-11) The woe of Israel's enemies.(Is. 17:12-14)<br>Is. 17:1-11 Sin desolates cities. It is strange that great conquerorsshould take pride in being enemies to mankind; but it is better thatflocks should lie down there, than that they should harbour any in openrebellion against God and holiness. The strong holds of Israel, thekingdom of the ten tribes, will be brought to ruin. Those who arepartakers in sin, are justly made partakers in ruin. The people had, bysins, made themselves ripe for ruin; and their glory was as quickly cutdown and taken away by the enemy, as the corn is out of the field bythe husbandman. Mercy is reserved in the midst of judgment, for aremnant. But very few shall be marked to be saved. Only here and thereone was left behind. But they shall be a remnant made holy. The fewthat are saved were awakened to return to God. They shall acknowledgehis hand in all events; they shall give him the glory due to his name.To bring us to this, is the design of his providence, as he is ourMaker; and the work of his grace, as he is the Holy One of Israel. Theyshall look off from their idols, the creatures of their own fancy. Wehave reason to account those afflictions happy, which part between usand our sins. The God of our salvation is the Rock of our strength; andour forgetfulness and unmindfulness of him are at the bottom of allsin. The pleasant plants, and shoots from a foreign soil, areexpressions for strange and idolatrous worship, and the vile practicesconnected therewith. Diligence would be used to promote the growth ofthese strange slips, but all in vain. See the evil and danger of sin,and its certain consequences.<br>Is. 17:12-14 The rage and force of the Assyrians resembled the mightywaters of the sea; but when the God of Israel should rebuke them, theywould flee like chaff, or like a rolling thing, before the whirlwind.In the evening Jerusalem would be in trouble, because of the powerfulinvader, but before morning his army would be nearly cut off. Happy arethose who remember God as their salvation, and rely on his power andgrace. The trouble of the believers, and the prosperity of theirenemies, will be equally short; while the joy of the former, and thedestruction of those that hate and spoil them, shall last for ever.
Isa 18:	<b>Overview</b><br>God's care for his people; and the increase of the church.<br>This chapter is one of the most obscure in Scripture, though more of itprobably was understood by those for whose use it was first intended,than by us now. Swift messengers are sent by water to a nation markedby Providence, and measured out, trodden under foot. God's people aretrampled on; but whoever thinks to swallow them up, finds they are castdown, yet not deserted, not destroyed. All the dwellers on earth mustwatch the motions of the Divine Providence, and wait upon thedirections of the Divine will. God gives assurance to his prophet, andby him to be given to his people. Zion is his rest for ever, and hewill look after it. He will suit to their case the comforts andrefreshments he provides for them; they will be acceptable, becauseseasonable. He will reckon with his and their enemies; and as God'speople are protected at all seasons of the year, so their enemies areexposed at all seasons. A tribute of praise should be brought to Godfrom all this. What is offered to God, must be offered in the way hehas appointed; and we may expect him to meet us where he records hisname. Thus shall the nations of the earth be convinced that Jehovah isthe God, and Israel is his people, and shall unite in presentingspiritual sacrifices to his glory. Happy are those who take warning byhis judgment on others, and hasten to join him and his people. Whateverland or people may be intended, we are here taught not to think thatGod takes no care of his church, and has no respect to the affairs ofmen, because he permits the wicked to triumph for a season. He has wisereasons for so doing, which we cannot now understand, but which willappear at the great day of his coming, when he will bring every workinto judgment, and reward every man according to his works.
Isa 19:	<b>Overview</b><br>Judgments upon Egypt. (Is. 19:1-17) Its deliverance, and the conversionof the people. (Is. 19:18-25)<br>Is. 19:1-17 God shall come into Egypt with his judgments. He will raiseup the causes of their destruction from among themselves. When ungodlymen escape danger, they are apt to think themselves secure; but evilpursues sinners, and will speedily overtake them, except they repent.The Egyptians will be given over into the hand of one who shall rulethem with rigour, as was shortly after fulfilled. The Egyptians wererenowned for wisdom and science; yet the Lord would give them up totheir own perverse schemes, and to quarrel, till their land would bebrought by their contests to become an object of contempt and pity. Herenders sinners afraid of those whom they have despised and oppressed;and the Lord of hosts will make the workers of iniquity a terror tothemselves, and to each other; and every object around a terror tothem.<br>Is. 19:18-25 The words, "In that day," do not always refer to thepassage just before. At a time which was to come, the Egyptians shallspeak the holy language, the Scripture language; not only understandit, but use it. Converting grace, by changing the heart, changes thelanguage; for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks. Somany Jews shall come to Egypt, that they shall soon fill five cities.Where the sun was worshipped, a place infamous for idolatry, even thereshall be a wonderful reformation. Christ, the great Altar, whosanctifies every gift, shall be owned, and the gospel sacrifices ofprayer and praise shall be offered up. Let the broken-hearted andafflicted, whom the Lord has wounded, and thus taught to return to, andcall upon him, take courage; for He will heal their souls, and turntheir sorrowing supplications into joyful praises. The Gentile nationsshall not only unite with each other in the gospel fold under Christ,the great Shepherd, but they shall all be united with the Jews. Theyshall be owned together by him; they shall all share in one and thesame blessing. Meeting at the same throne of grace, and serving witheach other in the same business of religion, should end all disputes,and unite the hearts of believers to each other in holy love.
Isa 20:	<b>Overview</b><br>The invasion and conquest of Egypt and Ethiopia.<br>Isaiah was a sign to the people by his unusual dress, when he walkedabroad. He commonly wore sackcloth as a prophet, to show himselfmortified to the world. He was to loose this from his loins; to wear noupper garments, and to go barefooted. This sign was to signify, thatthe Egyptians and Ethiopians should be led away captives by the king ofAssyria, thus stripped. The world will often deem believers foolish,when singular in obedience to God. But the Lord will support hisservants under the most trying effects of their obedience; and whatthey are called upon to suffer for his sake, commonly is light,compared with what numbers groan under from year to year from sin.Those who make any creature their expectation and glory, and so put itin the place of God, will, sooner or later, be ashamed of it. Butdisappointment in creature-confidences, instead of driving us todespair, should drive us to God, and our expectation shall not be invain. The same lesson is in force now; and where shall we look for aidin the hour of necessity, but to the Lord our Righteousness?
Isa 21:	<b>Overview</b><br>The taking of Babylon. (Is. 21:1-10) Of the Edomites. (Is. 21:11,12) Ofthe Arabs. (Is. 21:13-17)<br>Is. 21:1-10 Babylon was a flat country, abundantly watered. Thedestruction of Babylon, so often prophesied of by Isaiah, was typicalof the destruction of the great foe of the New Testament church,foretold in the Revelation. To the poor oppressed captives it would bewelcome news; to the proud oppressors it would be grievous. Let thischeck vain mirth and sensual pleasures, that we know not in whatheaviness the mirth may end. Here is the alarm given to Babylon, whenforced by Cyrus. An ass and a camel seem to be the symbols of the Medesand Persians. Babylon's idols shall be so far from protecting her, thatthey shall be broken down. True believers are the corn of God's floor;hypocrites are but as chaff and straw, with which the wheat is nowmixed, but from which it shall be separated. The corn of God's floormust expect to be threshed by afflictions and persecutions. God'sIsrael of old was afflicted. Even then God owns it is his still. In allevents concerning the church, past, present, and to come, we must lookto God, who has power to do any thing for his church, and grace to doevery thing that is for her good.<br>Is. 21:11,12 God's prophets and ministers are as watchmen in the cityin a time of peace, to see that all is safe. As watchmen in the camp intime of war, to warn of the motions of the enemy. After a long sleep insin and security, it is time to rise, to awake out of sleep. We have agreat deal of work to do, a long journey to go; it is time to bestirring. After a long dark night is there any hope of the day dawning?What tidings of the night? What happens to-night? We must never besecure. But many make curious inquiries of the watchmen. They wouldwillingly have nice questions solved, or difficult propheciesinterpreted; but they do not seek into the state of their own souls,about the way of salvation, and the path of duty. The watchman answersby way of prophecy. There comes first a morning of light, and peace,and opportunity; but afterward comes a night of trouble and calamity.If there be a morning of youth and health, there will come a night ofsickness and old age; if a morning of prosperity in the family, in thepublic, yet we must look for changes. It is our wisdom to improve thepresent morning, in preparation for the night that is coming after it.Inquire, return, come. We are urged to do it quickly, for there is notime to trifle. Those that return and come to God, will find they havea great deal of work to do, and but little time to do it in.<br>Is. 21:13-17 The Arabians lived in tents, and kept cattle. A destroyingarmy shall be brought upon them, and make them an easy prey. We knownot what straits we may be brought into before we die. Those may knowthe want of necessary food who now eat bread to the full. Neither theskill of archers, nor the courage of mighty men, can protect from thejudgments of God. That is poor glory, which will thus quickly come tonothing. Thus hath the Lord said to me; and no word of his shall fallto the ground. We may be sure the Strength of Israel will not lie.Happy are those only whose riches and glory are out of the reach ofinvaders; all other prosperity will speedily pass away.
Isa 22:	<b>Overview</b><br>The siege and taking of Jerusalem. (Is. 22:1-7) The wicked conduct ofits inhabitants. (Is. 22:8-14) The displacing of Shebna, and thepromotion of Eliakim, applied to the Messiah. (Is. 22:15-25)<br>Is. 22:1-7 Why is Jerusalem in such terror? Her slain men are not slainwith the sword, but with famine; or, slain with fear, disheartened.Their rulers fled, but were overtaken. The servants of God, who foreseeand warn sinners of coming miseries, are affected by the prospect. Butall the horrors of a city taken by storm, faintly shadow forth theterrors of the day of wrath.<br>Is. 22:8-14 The weakness of Judah now appeared more than ever. Now alsothey discovered their carnal confidence and their carnal security. Theylooked to the fortifications. They made sure of water for the city. Butthey were regardless of God in all these preparations. They did notcare for his glory in what they did. They did not depend upon him for ablessing on their endeavours. For every creature is to us what Godmakes it to be; and we must bless him for it, and use it for him. Therewas great contempt of God's wrath and justice, in contending with them.God's design was to humble them, and bring them to repentance. Theywalked contrary to this. Actual disbelief of another life after this,is at the bottom of the carnal security and brutish sensuality, whichare the sin, the shame, and ruin of so great a part of mankind. God wasdispleased at this. It is a sin against the remedy, and it is notlikely they should ever repent of it. Whether this unbelief works bypresumption or despair, it produces the same contempt of God, and is atoken that a man will perish wilfully.<br>Is. 22:15-25 This message to Shebna is a reproof of his pride, vanity,and security; what vanity is all earthly grandeur, which death will sosoon end! What will it avail, whether we are laid in a magnificenttomb, or covered with the green sod? Those who, when in power, turn andtoss others, will be justly turned and tossed themselves. Eliakimshould be put into Shebna's place. Those called to places of trust andpower, should seek to God for grace to enable them to do their duty.Eliakim's advancement is described. Our Lord Jesus describes his ownpower as Mediator, Rev. 3:7, that he has the key of David. His power inthe kingdom of heaven, and in ordering all the affairs of that kingdom,is absolute. Rulers should be fathers to those under their government;and the honour men bring unto their families, by their piety andusefulness, is more to be valued than what they derive from them bytheir names and titles. The glory of this world gives a man no realworth or excellence; it is but hung upon him, and it will soon dropfrom him. Eliakim was compared to a nail in a sure place; all hisfamily are said to depend upon him. In eastern houses, rows of largespikes were built up in the walls. Upon these the moveables andutensils were hung. Our Lord Jesus is as a nail in a sure place. Thatsoul cannot perish, nor that concern fall to the ground, which is byfaith hung upon Christ. He will set before the believer an open door,which no man can shut, and bring both body and soul to eternal glory.But those who neglect so great salvation will find, that when heshutteth none can open, whether it be shutting out from heaven, orshutting up in hell for ever.
Isa 23:	<b>Overview</b><br>The overthrow of Tyre. (Is. 23:1-14) It is established again. (Is.23:15-18)<br>Is. 23:1-14 Tyre was the mart of the nations. She was noted for mirthand diversions; and this made her loth to consider the warnings Godgave by his servants. Her merchants were princes, and lived likeprinces. Tyre being destroyed and laid waste, the merchants shouldabandon her. Flee to shift for thine own safety; but those that areuneasy in one place, will be so in another; for when God's judgmentspursue sinners, they will overtake them. Whence shall all this troublecome? It is a destruction from the Almighty. God designed to convincemen of the vanity and uncertainty of all earthly glory. Let the ruin ofTyre warn all places and persons to take heed of pride; for he whoexalts himself shall be abased. God will do it, who has all power inhis hand; but the Chaldeans shall be the instruments.<br>Is. 23:15-18 The desolations of Tyre were not to be for ever. The Lordwill visit Tyre in mercy. But when set at liberty, she will use her oldarts of temptation. The love of worldly wealth is spiritual idolatry;and covetousness is spiritual idolatry. This directs those that havewealth, to use it in the service of God. When we abide with God in ourworldly callings, when we do all in our power to further the gospel,then our merchandise and hire are holiness to the Lord, if we look tohis glory. Christians should carry on business as God's servants, anduse riches as his stewards.
Isa 24:	<b>Overview</b><br>The desolation of the land. (Is. 24:1-12) A few shall be preserved.(Is. 24:13-15) God's kingdom advanced by his judgments. (Is. 24:16-23)<br>Is. 24:1-12 All whose treasures and happiness are laid up on earth,will soon be brought to want and misery. It is good to apply toourselves what the Scripture says of the vanity and vexation of spiritwhich attend all things here below. Sin has turned the earth upsidedown; the earth is become quite different to man, from what it was whenGod first made it to be his habitation. It is, at the best, like aflower, which withers in the hands of those that please themselves withit, and lay it in their bosoms. The world we live in is a world ofdisappointment, a vale of tears; the children of men in it are but offew days, and full of trouble, See the power of God's curse, how itmakes all empty, and lays waste all ranks and conditions. Sin bringsthese calamities upon the earth; it is polluted by the sins of men,therefore it is made desolate by God's judgments. Carnal joy will soonbe at end, and the end of it is heaviness. God has many ways toimbitter wine and strong drink to those who love them; distemper ofbody, anguish of mind, and the ruin of the estate, will make strongdrink bitter, and the delights of sense tasteless. Let men learn tomourn for sin, and rejoice in God; then no man, no event, can taketheir joy from them.<br>Is. 24:13-15 There shall be a remnant preserved from the general ruin,and it shall be a devout and pious remnant. These few are dispersed;like the gleanings of the olive tree, hid under the leaves. The Lordknows those that are his; the world does not. When the mirth of carnalworldlings ceases, the joy of the saints is as lively as ever, becausethe covenant of grace, the fountain of their comforts, and thefoundation of their hopes, never fails. Those who rejoice in the Lordcan rejoice in tribulation, and by faith may triumph when all aboutthem are in tears. They encourage their fellow-sufferers to dolikewise, even those who are in the furnace of affliction. Or, in thevalleys, low, dark, miry places. In every fire, even the hottest, inevery place, even the remotest, let us keep up our good thoughts ofGod. If none of these trials move us, then we glorify the Lord in thefires.<br>Is. 24:16-23 Believers may be driven into the uttermost parts of theearth; but they are singing, not sighing. Here is terror to sinners;the prophet laments the miseries he saw breaking in like a torrent; andthe small number of believers. He foresees that sin would abound. Themeaning is plain, that evil pursues sinners. Unsteady, uncertain areall these things. Worldly men think to dwell in the earth as in apalace, as in a castle; but it shall be removed like a cottage, like alodge put up for the night. It shall fall and not rise again; but thereshall be new heavens and a new earth, in which shall dwell nothing butrighteousness. Sin is a burden to the whole creation; it is a heavyburden, under which it groans now, and will sink at last. The highones, that are puffed up with their grandeur, that think themselves outof the reach of danger, God will visit for their pride and cruelty. Letus judge nothing before the time, though some shall be visited. None inthis world should be secure, though their condition be ever soprosperous; nor need any despair, though their condition be ever sodeplorable. God will be glorified in all this. But the mystery ofProvidence is not yet finished. The ruin of the Redeemer's enemies mustmake way for his kingdom, and then the Sun of Righteousness will appearin full glory. Happy are those who take warning by the sentence againstothers; every impenitent sinner will sink under his transgression, andrise no more, while believers enjoy everlasting bliss.
Isa 25:	<b>Overview</b><br>A song of praise. (Is. 25:1-5) A declaration of the gospel blessings.(Is. 25:6-8) The destruction of the enemies of Christ's church. (Is.25:9-12)<br>Is. 25:1-5 However this might show the deliverance of the Jews out ofcaptivity, it looked further, to the praises that should be offered upto God for Christ's victories over our spiritual enemies, and thecomforts he has provided for all believers. True faith simply creditsthe Lord's testimony, and relies on his truth to perform his promises.As God weakens the strong who are proud and secure, so he strengthensthe weak that are humble, and stay themselves upon him. God protectshis people in all weathers. The Lord shelters those who trust in himfrom the insolence of oppressors. Their insolence is but the noise ofstrangers; it is like the heat of the sun scorching in the middle ofthe day; but where is it when the sun is set? The Lord ever was, andever will be, the Refuge of distressed believers. Having provided thema shelter, he teaches them to flee unto it.<br>Is. 25:6-8 The kind reception of repentant sinners, is often in the NewTestament likened to a feast. The guests invited are all people,Gentiles as well as Jews. There is that in the gospel which strengthensand makes glad the heart, and is fit for those who are underconvictions of sin, and mourning for it. There is a veil spread overall nations, for all sat in darkness. But this veil the Lord willdestroy, by the light of his gospel shining in the world, and the powerof his Spirit opening men's eyes to receive it. He will raise those tospiritual life who were long dead in trespasses and sins. Christ willhimself, in his resurrection, triumph over death. Grief shall bebanished; there shall be perfect and endless joy. Those that mourn forsin shall be comforted. Those who suffer for Christ shall haveconsolations. But in the joys of heaven, and not short of them, willfully be brought to pass this saying, God shall wipe away all tears.The hope of this should now do away over-sorrow, all weeping thathinders sowing. Sometimes, in this world God takes away the reproach ofhis people from among men; however, it will be done fully at the greatday. Let us patiently bear sorrow and shame now; both will be done awayshortly.<br>Is. 25:9-12 With joy and praise will those entertain the glad tidingsof the Redeemer, who looked for him; and with a triumphant song willglorified saints enter into the joy of their Lord. And it is not invain to wait for him; for the mercy comes at last, with abundantrecompence for the delay. The hands once stretched out upon the cross,to make way for our salvation, will at length be stretched forth todestroy all impenitent sinners. Moab is here put for all adversaries ofGod's people; they shall all be trodden down or threshed. God shallbring down the pride of the enemies by one humbling judgment afteranother. This destruction of Moab is typical of Christ's victory, andthe pulling down of Satan's strong holds. Therefore, beloved brethren,be ye stedfast, unmovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord;for your labour is not in vain in the Lord.
Isa 26:	<b>Overview</b><br>The Divine mercies encourage to confidence in God. (Is. 26:1-4) Hisjudgments. (Is. 26:5-11) His people exhorted to wait upon Him. (Is.26:12-19) Deliverance promised. (Is. 26:20,21)<br>Is. 26:1-4 "That day," seems to mean when the New Testament Babylonshall be levelled with the ground. The unchangeable promise andcovenant of the Lord are the walls of the church of God. The gates ofthis city shall be open. Let sinners then be encouraged to join to theLord. Thou wilt keep him in peace; in perfect peace, inward peace,outward peace, peace with God, peace of conscience, peace at all times,in all events. Trust in the Lord for that peace, that portion, whichwill be for ever. Whatever we trust to the world for, it will last onlyfor a moment; but those who trust in God shall not only find in him,but shall receive from him, strength that will carry them to thatblessedness which is for ever. Let us then acknowledge him in all ourways, and rely on him in all trials.<br>Is. 26:5-11 The way of the just is evenness, a steady course ofobedience and holy conversation. And it is their happiness that Godmakes their way plain and easy. It is our duty, and will be ourcomfort, to wait for God, to keep up holy desires toward him in thedarkest and most discouraging times. Our troubles must never turn usfrom God; and in the darkest, longest night of affliction, with oursouls must we desire him; and this we must wait and pray to him for. Wemake nothing of our religion, whatever our profession may be, if we donot make heart-work of it. Though we come ever so early, we shall findGod ready to receive us. The intention of afflictions is to teachrighteousness: blessed is the man whom the Lord thus teaches. Butsinners walk contrary to him. They will go on in their evil ways,because they will not consider what a God he is whose laws they persistin despising. Scorners and the secure will shortly feel, what now theywill not believe, that it is a fearful thing to fall into the hands ofthe living God. They will not see the evil of sin; but they shall see.Oh that they would abandon their sins, and turn to the Lord, that hemay have mercy upon them.<br>Is. 26:12-19 Every creature, every business, any way serviceable to ourcomfort, God makes to be so; he makes that work for us which seemed tomake against us. They had been slaves of sin and Satan; but by theDivine grace they were taught to look to be set free from all formermasters. The cause opposed to God and his kingdom will sink at last.See our need of afflictions. Before, prayer came drop by drop; now theypour it out, it comes now like water from a fountain. Afflictions bringus to secret prayer. Consider Christ as the Speaker addressing hischurch. His resurrection from the dead was an earnest of all thedeliverance foretold. The power of his grace, like the dew or rain,which causes the herbs that seem dead to revive, would raise his churchfrom the lowest state. But we may refer to the resurrection of thedead, especially of those united to Christ.<br>Is. 26:20,21 When dangers threaten, it is good to retire and lie hid;when we commend ourselves to God to hide us, he will hide us eitherunder heaven or in heaven. Thus we shall be safe and happy in the midstof tribulations. It is but for a short time, as it were for a littlemoment; when over, it will seem as nothing. God's place is themercy-seat; there he delights to be: when he punishes, he comes out ofhis place, for he has no pleasure in the death of sinners. But there ishardly any truth more frequently repeated in Scripture, than God'sdetermined purpose to punish the workers of iniquity. Let us keep closeto the Lord, and separate from the world; and let us seek comfort insecret prayer. A day of vengeance is coming on the world, and before itcomes we are to expect tribulation and suffering. But because theChristian looks for these things, shall he be restless and dismayed?No, let him repose himself in his God. Abiding in him, the believer issafe. And let us wait patiently the fulfilling of God's promises.
Isa 27:	<b>Overview</b><br>God's care over his people. (Is. 27:1-5) A promise of their recall toDivine favour. (Is. 27:6-13)<br>Is. 27:1-5 The Lord Jesus with his strong sword, the virtue of hisdeath, and the preaching of his gospel, does and will destroy him thathad the power of death, that is, the devil, that old serpent. The worldis a fruitless, worthless wilderness; but the church is a vineyard, aplace that has great care taken of it, and from which precious fruitsare gathered. God will keep it in the night of affliction andpersecution, and in the day of peace and prosperity, the temptations ofwhich are not less dangerous. God also takes care of the fruitfulnessof this vineyard. We need the continual waterings of Divine grace; ifthese be at any time withdrawn, we wither, and come to nothing. ThoughGod sometimes contends with his people, yet he graciously waits to bereconciled unto them. It is true, when he finds briers and thornsinstead of vines, and they are set in array against him, he will treadthem down and burn them. Here is a summary of the doctrine of thegospel, with which the church is to be watered every moment. Ever sincesin first entered, there has been, on God's part, a righteous quarrel,but, on man's part, most unrighteous. Here is a gracious invitationgiven. Pardoning mercy is called the power of our Lord; let us takehold on that. Christ crucified is the power of God. Let us by livelyfaith take hold on his strength who is a strength to the needy,believing there is no other name by which we can be saved, as a manthat is sinking catches hold of a bough, or cord, or plank, that is inhis reach. This is the only way, and it is a sure way, to be saved. Godis willing to be reconciled to us.<br>Is. 27:6-13 In the days of the gospel, the latter days, the gospelchurch shall be more firmly fixed than the Jewish church, and shallspread further. May our souls be continually watered and kept, that wemay abound in the fruits of the Spirit, in all goodness, righteousness,and truth. The Jews yet are kept a separate and a numerous people; theyhave not been rooted out as those who slew them. The condition of thatnation, through so many ages, forms a certain proof of the Divineorigin of the Scriptures; and the Jews live amongst us, a continuedwarning against sin. But though winds are ever so rough, ever so high,God can say to them, Peace, be still. And though God will afflict hispeople, yet he will make their afflictions to work for the good oftheir souls. According to this promise, since the captivity in Babylon,no people have shown such hatred to idols and idolatry as the Jews. Andto all God's people, the design of affliction is to part between themand sin. The affliction has done us good, when we keep at a distancefrom the occasions of sin, and use care that we may not be tempted toit. Jerusalem had been defended by grace and the Divine protection; butwhen God withdrew, she was left like a wilderness. This has awfullycome to pass. And this is a figure of the deplorable state of thevineyard, the church, when it brought forth wild grapes. Sinnersflatter themselves they shall not be dealt with severely, because Godis merciful, and is their Maker. We see how weak those pleas will be.Verses 12,13, seem to predict the restoration of the Jews after theBabylonish captivity, and their recovery from their present dispersion.This is further applicable to the preaching of the gospel, by whichsinners are gathered into the grace of God; the gospel proclaims theacceptable year of the Lord. Those gathered by the sounding of thegospel trumpet, are brought in to worship God, and added to the church;and the last trumpet will gather the saints together.
Isa 28:	<b>Overview</b><br>The desolations of Samaria. (Is. 28:1-4) The prosperity of Judah; withreproofs for sinfulness and unbelief. (Is. 28:5-15) Christ is pointedout as the sure Foundation for all believers. (Is. 28:16-22) God'sdealings with his people. (Is. 28:23-29)<br>Is. 28:1-4 What men are proud of, be it ever so mean, is to them as acrown; but pride is the forerunner of destruction. How foolishlydrunkards act! Those who are overcome with wine are overcome by Satan;and there is not greater drudgery in the world than hard drinking.Their health is ruined; men are broken in their callings and estates,and their families are ruined by it. Their souls are in danger of beingundone for ever, and all merely to gratify a base lust. In God'sprofessing people, like Israel, it is worse than in any other. And heis just in taking away the plenty they thus abuse. The plenty they wereproud of, is but a fading flower. Like the early fruit, which, as soonas discovered, is plucked and eaten.<br>Is. 28:5-15 The prophet next turns to Judah, whom he calls the residueof his people. Happy are those alone, who glory in the Lord of hostshimself. Hence his people get wisdom and strength for every service andevery conflict. But it is only in Christ Jesus that the holy Godcommunicates with sinful man. And whether those that teach are drunkwith wine, or intoxicated with false doctrines and notions concerningthe kingdom and salvation of the Messiah, they not only err themselves,but lead multitudes astray. All places where such persons have taughtare filled with errors. For our instruction in the things of God, it isneedful that the same precept and the same line should be oftenrepeated to us, that we may the better understand them. God, by hisword, calls us to what is really for our advantage; the service of Godis the only true rest for those weary of the service of sin, and thereis no refreshment but under the easy yoke of the Lord Jesus. All thishad little effect upon the people. Those who will not understand whatis plain, but scorn and despise it as mean and trifling, are justlypunished. If we are at peace with God, we have, in effect, made acovenant with death; whenever it comes, it cannot do us any realdamage, if we are Christ's. But to think of making death our friend,while by sin we are making God our enemy, is absurd. And do not theymake lies their refuge who trust in their own righteousness, or to adeath-bed repentance? which is a resolution to sin no more, when it isno longer in their power to do so.<br>Is. 28:16-22 Here is a promise of Christ, as the only foundation ofhope for escaping the wrath to come. This foundation was laid in Zion,in the eternal counsels of God. This foundation is a stone, firm andable to support his church. It is a tried stone, a chosen stone,approved of God, and never failed any who made trial of it. A cornerstone, binding together the whole building, and bearing the wholeweight; precious in the sight of the Lord, and of every believer; asure foundation on which to build. And he who in any age or nationshall believe this testimony, and rest all his hopes, and hisnever-dying soul on this foundation, shall never be confounded. Theright effect of faith in Christ is, to quiet and calm the soul, tillevents shall be timed by Him, who has all times in his own hand andpower. Whatever men trust to for justification, except therighteousness of Christ; or for wisdom, strength, and holiness, exceptthe influences of the Holy Ghost; or for happiness, except the favourof God; that protection in which they thought to shelter themselves,will prove not enough to answer the intention. Those who rest in arighteousness of their own, will have deceived themselves: the bed istoo short, the covering too narrow. God will be glorified in thefulfilling of his counsels. If those that profess to be members ofGod's church, make themselves like Philistines and Canaanites, theymust expect to be dealt with as such. Then dare not to ridicule thereproofs of God's word, or the approaches of judgements.<br>Is. 28:23-29 The husbandman applies to his calling with pains andprudence, in all the works of it according to their nature. Thus theLord, who has given men this wisdom, is wonderful in counsel, andexcellent in his working. As the occasion requires, he threatens,corrects, spares, shows mercy, or executes vengeance. Afflictions areGod's threshing instruments, to loosen us from the world, to partbetween us and our chaff, and to prepare us for use. God willproportion them to our strength; they shall be no heavier than there isneed. When his end is answered, the trials and sufferings of his peopleshall cease; his wheat shall be gathered into the garner, but the chaffshall be burned with unquenchable fire.
Isa 29:	<b>Overview</b><br>Judgements on Jerusalem and on its enemies. (Is. 29:1-8) Thesenselessness and hypocrisy of the Jews. (Is. 29:9-16) The conversionof the Gentiles, and future blessings for the Jews. (Is. 29:17-24)<br>Is. 29:1-8 Ariel may signify the altar of burnt-offerings. LetJerusalem know that outward religious services will not make men freefrom judgements. Hypocrites never can please God, nor make their peacewith him. God had often and long, by a host of angels, encamped roundabout Jerusalem for protection and deliverance; but now he foughtagainst it. Proud looks and proud language shall be brought down byhumbling providences. The destruction of Jerusalem's enemies isforetold. The army of Sennacherib went as a dream; and thus themultitudes, that through successive ages fight against God's altar andworship, shall fall. Speedily will sinners awake from their soothingdreams in the pains of hell.<br>Is. 29:9-16 The security of sinners in sinful ways, is cause forlamentation and wonder. The learned men, through prejudice, said thatthe Divine prophecies were obscure; and the poor urged their want oflearning. The Bible is a sealed book to every man, learned orunlearned, till he begins to study it with a simple heart and ateachable spirit, that he may thence learn the truth and the will ofGod. To worship God, is to approach him. And if the heart be full ofhis love and fear, out of the abundance of it the mouth will speak; butthere are many whose religion is lip-labour only. When they pretend tobe speaking to God, they are thinking of a thousand foolish things.They worship the God of Israel according to their own devices. Numbersare only formal in worship. And their religion is only to comply withcustom, and to serve their own interest. But the wanderings of mind,and defects in devotion, which are the believer's burden, are verydifferent from the withdrawing of the heart from God, so severelyblamed. And those who make religion no more than a pretence, to serve aturn, deceive themselves. And as those that quarrel with God, so thosethat think to conceal themselves from him, in effect charge him withfolly. But all their perverse conduct shall be entirely done away.<br>Is. 29:17-24 The wonderful change here foretold, may refer to theaffairs of Judah, though it looks further. When a great harvest ofsouls was gathered to Christ from among the Gentiles, then thewilderness was turned into a fruitful field; and the Jewish church,that had long been a fruitful field, became as a deserted forest. Thosewho, when in trouble, can truly rejoice in God, shall soon have causegreatly to rejoice in him. The grace of meekness contributes to theincrease of our holy joy. The enemies who were powerful shall becomemean and weak. To complete the repose of God's people, the scorners athome shall be cut off by judgements. All are apt to speak unadvisedly,and to mistake what they hear, but it is very unfair to make a man anoffender for a word. They did all they could to bring those intotrouble who told them of their faults. But He that redeemed Abraham outof his snares and troubles, will redeem those who are, by faith, histrue seed, out of theirs. It will be the greatest comfort to godlyparents to see their children renewed creatures, the work of God'sgrace. May those who now err in spirit, and murmur against the truth,come to understanding, and learn true doctrine. The Spirit of truthshall set right their mistakes, and lead them into all truth. Thisshould encourage us to pray for those that have erred, and aredeceived. All who murmured at the truths of God, as hard sayings, shalllearn and be aware what God designed in all. See the change religionproduces in the hearts of men, and the peace and pleasure of a humbleand devout spirit.
Isa 30:	<b>Overview</b><br>The Jews reproved for seeking aid from Egypt. (Is. 30:1-7) Judgementsin consequence of their contempt of God's word. (Is. 30:8-18) God'smercies to his church. (Is. 30:19-26) The ruin of the Assyrian army,and of all God's enemies. (Is. 30:27-33)<br>Is. 30:1-7 It was often the fault and folly of the Jews, that whentroubled by their neighbours on one side, they sought for succour fromothers, instead of looking up to God. Nor can we avoid the dreadfulconsequences of adding sin to sin, but by making the righteousness ofChrist our refuge, and seeking for the sanctification of the HolySpirit. Men have always been prone to lean to their own understandings,but this will end in their shame and misery. They would not trust inGod. They took much pains to gain the Egyptians. The riches so spentturned to a bad account. See what dangers men run into who forsake Godto follow their carnal confidences. The Creator is the Rock of ages,the creature a broken reed; we cannot expect too little from man, ortoo much from God. Our strength is to sit still, in humble dependenceupon God and his goodness, and quiet submission to his will.<br>Is. 30:8-18 The Jews were the only professing people God then had inthe world, yet many among them were rebellious. They had the light, butthey loved darkness rather. The prophets checked them in their sinfulpursuits, so that they could not proceed without fear; this they tookamiss. But faithful ministers will not be driven from seeking to awakensinners. God is the Holy One of Israel, and so they shall find him.They did not like to hear of his holy commandments and his hatred ofsin; they desired that they might no more be reminded of these things.But as they despised the word of God, their sins undermined theirsafety. Their state would be dashed in pieces like a potter's vessel.Let us return from our evil ways, and settle in the way of duty; thatis the way to be saved. Would we be strengthened, it must be inquietness and in confidence, keeping peace in our own minds, andrelying upon God. They think themselves wiser than God; but the projectby which they thought to save themselves was their ruin. Only here andthere one shall escape, as a warning to others. If men will not repent,turn to God, and seek happiness in his favour and service, theirdesires will but hasten their ruin. Those who make God alone theirconfidence, will have comfort. God ever waits to be gracious to allthat come to him by faith in Christ, and happy are those who wait forhim.<br>Is. 30:19-26 God's people will soon arrive at the Zion above, and thenthey will weep no more for ever. Even now they would have more comfort,as well as holiness, if they were more constant in prayer. A famine ofbread is not so great a judgment as a famine of the word of God. Thereare right-hand and left-hand errors; the tempter is busy courting usinto by-paths. It is happy if, by the counsels of a faithful ministeror friend, or the checks of conscience, and the strivings of God theSpirit, we are set right when doubting, and prevented from going wrong.They shall be cured of their idolatry. To all true penitents sinbecomes very hateful. This is shown daily in the conversion of souls,by the power of Divine grace, to the fear and love of God. Abundantmeans of grace, with the influences of the Holy Spirit, would beextended to places destitute of them. The effect of this should becomfort and joy to the people of God. Light, that is, knowledge, shallincrease. This is the light which the gospel brought into the world,and which proclaims healing to the broken-hearted.<br>Is. 30:27-33 God curbs and restrains from doing mischief. With a wordhe guides his people into the right way, but with a bridle he turns hisenemies upon their own ruin. Here, in threatening the ruin ofSennacherib's army, the prophet points at the final and everlastingdestruction of all impenitent sinners. Tophet was a valley nearJerusalem, where fires were continually burning to destroy things thatwere hurtful and offensive, and there the idolatrous Jews caused theirchildren to pass through the fire to Moloch. This denotes the certaintyof the destruction, as an awful emblem of the place of torment in theother world. No oppressor shall escape the Divine wrath. Let sinnersthen flee to Christ, seeking to be reconciled to Him, that they may besafe and happy, when destruction from the Almighty shall sweep away allthe workers of iniquity.
Isa 31:	<b>Overview</b><br>The sin and folly of seeking help from Egypt. (Is. 31:1-5) God's carefor Jerusalem. (Is. 31:6-9)<br>Is. 31:1-5 God will oppose the help sought from workers of iniquity.Sinners may be convicted of folly by plain and self-evident truths,which they cannot deny, but will not believe. There is no escaping thejudgments of God; and evil pursues sinners. The Lord of hosts will comedown to fight for Mount Zion. The Lion of the tribe of Judah willappear for the defence of his church. And as birds hovering over theiryoung ones to protect them, with such compassion and affection will theLord of hosts defend Jerusalem. He will so defend it, as to secure itssafety.<br>Is. 31:6-9 They have been backsliding children, yet children; let themreturn, and their backslidings shall be healed, though they have sunkdeep into misery, and cannot easily recover. Many make an idol of theirsilver and gold, and by the love of that are drawn from God; but thosewho turn to God, will be ready to part with it. Then, when they havecast away their idols, shall the Assyrian fall by the sword of anangel, who strikes more strongly than a mighty man, yet more secretlythan a mean man. God can make the stoutest heart to tremble. But if wekeep up the fire of holy love and devotion in our hearts and houses, wemay depend upon God to protect us and them.
Isa 32:	<b>Overview</b><br>Times of peace and happiness. (Is. 32:1-8) An interval of trouble, yetcomfort and blessings in the end. (Is. 32:9-20)<br>Is. 32:1-8 Christ our righteous King, and his true disciples, areevidently here intended. The consolations and graces of his Spirit areas rivers of water in this dry land; and as the overhanging rockaffords refreshing shade and shelter to the weary traveller in thedesert, so his power, truth, and love, yield the believer the only realprotection and refreshment in the weary land through which he journeysto heaven. Christ bore the storm himself, to keep it off from us. Tohim let the trembling sinner flee for refuge; for he alone can protectand refresh us in every trial. See what pains sinners take in sin; theylabour at it, their hearts are intent upon it, and with art they workiniquity; but this is our comfort, that they can do no more mischiefthan God permits. Let us seek to have our hearts more freed fromselfishness. The liberal soul devises liberal things concerning God,and desires that He will grant wisdom and prudence, the comforts of hispresence, the influence of his Spirit, and in due time the enjoyment ofhis glory.<br>Is. 32:9-20 When there was so much provocation given to the holy God,bad times might be expected. Alas! how many careless ones there are,who support self-indulgence by shameful niggardliness! We deserve to bedeprived of the supports of life, when we make them the food of lusts.Let such tremble and be troubled. Blessed times shall be brought in bythe pouring out of the Spirit from on high; then, and not till then,there will be good times. The present state of the Jews shall continueuntil a more abundant pouring out of the Spirit from on high. Peace andquietness shall be found in the way and work of righteousness. Truesatisfaction is to be had only in true religion. And real holiness isreal happiness now, and shall be perfect happiness, that is, perfectholiness for ever. The good seed of the word shall be sown in allplaces, and be watered by Divine grace; and laborious, patientlabourers shall be sent forth into God's husbandry.
Isa 33:	<b>Overview</b><br>God's judgments against the enemies of his church. (Is. 33:1-14) Thehappiness of his people. (Is. 33:15-24)<br>Is. 33:1-14 Here we have the proud and false destroyer justly reckonedwith for all his fraud and violence. The righteous God often payssinners in their own coin. Those who by faith humbly wait for God,shall find him gracious to them; as the day, so let the strength be. IfGod leaves us to ourselves any morning, we are undone; we must everymorning commit ourselves to him, and go forth in his strength to do thework of the day. When God arises, his enemies are scattered. Truewisdom and knowledge lead to strength of salvation, which renders usstedfast in the ways of God; and true piety is the only treasure whichcan never be plundered or spent. The distress Jerusalem was broughtinto, is described. God's time to appear for his people, is, when allother helpers fail. Let all who hear what God has done, acknowledgethat he can do every thing. Sinners in Zion will have much to answerfor, above other sinners. And those that rebel against the commands ofthe word, cannot take its comforts in time of need. His wrath will burnthose everlastingly who make themselves fuel for it. It is a fire thatshall never be quenched, nor ever go out of itself; it is the wrath ofan ever-living God preying on the conscience of a never-dying soul.<br>Is. 33:15-24 The true believer watches against all occasions of sin.The Divine power will keep him safe, and his faith in that power willkeep him easy. He shall want nothing needful for him. Every blessing ofsalvation is freely bestowed on all that ask with humble, believingprayer; and the believer is safe in time and for ever. Those that walkuprightly shall not only have bread given, and their water sure, butthey shall, by faith, see the King of kings in his beauty, the beautyof holiness. The remembrance of the terror they were in, shall add tothe pleasure of their deliverance. It is desirable to be quiet in ourown houses, but much more so to be quiet in God's house; and in everyage Christ will have a seed to serve him. Jerusalem had no large riverrunning by it, but the presence and power of God make up all wants. Wehave all in God, all we need, or can desire. By faith we take Christfor our Prince and Saviour; he reigns over his redeemed people. Allthat refuse to have Him to reign over them, make shipwreck of theirsouls. Sickness is taken away in mercy, when the fruit of it is thetaking away of sin. If iniquity be taken away, we have little reason tocomplain of outward affliction. This last verse leads our thoughts, notonly to the most glorious state of the gospel church on earth, but toheaven, where no sickness or trouble can enter. He that blotteth outour transgressions, will heal our souls.
Isa 34:	<b>Overview</b><br>God's vengeance against the enemies of his church. (Is. 34:1-8) Theirdesolation. (Is. 34:9-17)<br>Is. 34:1-8 Here is a prophecy of the wars of the Lord, all which areboth righteous and successful. All nations are concerned. And as theyhave all had the benefit of his patience, so all must expect to feelhis resentment. The description of bloodshed suggests tremendous ideasof the Divine judgments. Idumea here denotes the nations at enmity withthe church; also the kingdom of antichrist. Our thoughts cannot reachthe horrors of that awful season, to those found opposing the church ofChrist. There is a time fixed in the Divine counsels for thedeliverance of the church, and the destruction of her enemies. We mustpatiently wait till then, and judge nothing before the time. ThroughChrist, mercy is exercised to every believer, consistently withjustice, and his name is glorified.<br>Is. 34:9-17 Those who aim to ruin the church, can never do that, butwill ruin themselves. What dismal changes sin can make! It turns afruitful land into barrenness, a crowded city into a wilderness. Let uscompare all we discover in the book of the Lord, with the dealings ofprovidence around us, that we may be more diligent in seeking thekingdom of God and his righteousness. What the mouth of the Lord hascommanded, his Spirit will perform. And let us observe how theevidences of the truth continually increase, as one prophecy afteranother is fulfilled, until these awful scenes bring in more happydays. As Israel was a figure of the Christian church, so the Edomites,their bitter enemies, represent the enemies of the kingdom of Christ.God's Jerusalem may be laid in ruins for a time, but the enemies of thechurch shall be desolate for ever.
Isa 35:	<b>Overview</b><br>The flourishing state of Christ's kingdom. (Is. 35:1-4) The privilegesof his people. (Is. 35:5-10)<br>Is. 35:1-4 Judea was prosperous in the days of Hezekiah, but thekingdom of Christ is the great subject intended. Converting grace makesthe soul that was a wilderness, to rejoice with joy and singing, and toblossom abundantly. The feeble and faint-hearted are encouraged. Thisis the design of the gospel. Fear is weakening; the more we striveagainst it, the stronger we are, both for doing and suffering; and hethat says to us, Be strong, has laid help for us upon One who ismighty. Assurance is given of the approach of Messiah, to takevengeance on the powers of darkness, to recompense with abundantcomforts those that mourn in Zion; He will come and save. He will comeagain at the end of time, to punish those who have troubled his people;and to give those who were troubled such rest as will be a full rewardfor all their troubles.<br>Is. 35:5-10 When Christ shall come to set up his kingdom in the world,then wonders, great wonders, shall be wrought on men's souls. By theword and Spirit of Christ, the spiritually blind were enlightened; andthose deaf to the calls of God were made to hear them readily. Thoseunable to do any thing good, by Divine grace were made active therein.Those that knew not how to speak of God or to God, had their lipsopened to show forth his praise. When the Holy Ghost came upon theGentiles that heard the word, then were the fountains of life opened.Most of the earth is still a desert; neither means of grace, spiritualworshippers, nor fruits of holiness, are to be found in it. But the wayof religion and godliness shall be laid open. The way of holiness isthe way of God's commandment; it is the good old way. And the way toheaven is a plain way. Those knowing but little, and unlearned, shallbe kept from missing the road. It shall be a safe way; nothing can dothem any real hurt. Christ, the way to God, shall be clearly madeknown; and the way of a believer's duty shall be plainly marked out.Let us then go forward cheerfully, assured that the end of this wayshall be everlasting joy, and rest for the soul. Those who by faith aremade citizens of the gospel Zion, rejoice in Christ Jesus; and theirsorrows and sighs are made to flee away by Divine consolations. Thusthese prophecies conclude. Our joyful hopes and prospects of eternallife should swallow up all the sorrows and all the joys of this presenttime. But of what avail is it to admire the excellence of God's word,unless we can call its precious promises our own? Do we love God, notonly as our Creator, but because he gave his only Son to die for us?And are we walking in the ways of holiness? Let us try ourselves bysuch plain questions, rather than spend time on things that may becurious and amusing, but are unprofitable.

Isa 38:	<b>Overview</b><br>Hezekiah's sickness and recovery. (Is. 38:1-8) His thanksgiving. (Is.38:9-22)<br>Is. 38:1-8 When we pray in our sickness, though God send not to us suchan answer as he here sent to Hezekiah, yet, if by his Spirit he bids usbe of good cheer, assures us that our sins are forgiven, and that,whether we live or die, we shall be his, we do not pray in vain. See IIKin. 20:1-11.<br>Is. 38:9-22 We have here Hezekiah's thanksgiving. It is well for us toremember the mercies we receive in sickness. Hezekiah records thecondition he was in. He dwells upon this; I shall no more see the Lord.A good man wishes not to live for any other end than that he may serveGod, and have communion with him. Our present residence is like that ofa shepherd in his hut, a poor, mean, and cold lodging, and with a trustcommitted to our charge, as the shepherd has. Our days are compared tothe weaver's shuttle, Job 7:6, passing and repassing very swiftly,every throw leaving a thread behind it; and when finished, the piece iscut off, taken out of the loom, and showed to our Master to be judgedof. A good man, when his life is cut off, his cares and fatigues arecut off with it, and he rests from his labours. But our times are inGod's hand; he has appointed what shall be the length of the piece.When sick, we are very apt to calculate our time, but are still atuncertainty. It should be more our care how we shall get safe toanother world. And the more we taste of the loving-kindness of God, themore will our hearts love him, and live to him. It was in love to ourpoor perishing souls that Christ delivered them. The pardon does notmake the sin not to have been sin, but not to be punished as itdeserves. It is pleasant to think of our recoveries from sickness, whenwe see them flowing from the pardon of sin. Hezekiah's opportunity toglorify God in this world, he made the business, and pleasure, and endof life. Being recovered, he resolves to abound in praising and servingGod. God's promises are not to do away, but to quicken and encouragethe use of means. Life and health are given that we may glorify God anddo good.

Isa 40:	<b>Overview</b><br>The preaching of the gospel, and glad tidings of the coming of Christ.(Is. 40:1-11) The almighty power of God. (Is. 40:12-17) The folly ofidolatry. (Is. 40:18-26) Against unbelief. (Is. 40:27-31)<br>Is. 40:1-11 All human life is a warfare; the Christian life is the mostso; but the struggle will not last always. Troubles are removed inlove, when sin is pardoned. In the great atonement of the death ofChrist, the mercy of God is exercised to the glory of his justice. InChrist, and his sufferings, true penitents receive of the Lord's handdouble for all their sins; for the satisfaction Christ made by hisdeath was of infinite value. The prophet had some reference to thereturn of the Jews from Babylon. But this is a small event, comparedwith that pointed out by the Holy Ghost in the New Testament, when Johnthe Baptist proclaimed the approach of Christ. When eastern princesmarched through desert countries, ways were prepared for them, andhinderances removed. And may the Lord prepare our hearts by theteaching of his word and the convictions of his Spirit, that high andproud thoughts may be brought down, good desires planted, crooked andrugged tempers made straight and softened, and every hinderanceremoved, that we may be ready for his will on earth, and prepared forhis heavenly kingdom. What are all that belongs to fallen man, or allthat he does, but as the grass and the flower thereof! And what willall the titles and possessions of a dying sinner avail, when they leavehim under condemnation! The word of the Lord can do that for us, whichall flesh cannot. The glad tidings of the coming of Christ were to besent forth to the ends of the earth. Satan is the strong man armed; butour Lord Jesus is stronger; and he shall proceed, and do all that hepurposes. Christ is the good Shepherd; he shows tender care for youngconverts, weak believers, and those of a sorrowful spirit. By his wordhe requires no more service, and by his providence he inflicts no moretrouble, than he will strengthen them for. May we know our Shepherd'svoice, and follow him, proving ourselves his sheep.<br>Is. 40:12-17 All created beings shrink to nothing in comparison withthe Creator. When the Lord, by his Spirit, made the world, nonedirected his Spirit, or gave advice what to do, or how to do it. Thenations, in comparison of him, are as a drop which remains in thebucket, compared with the vast ocean; or as the small dust in thebalance, which does not turn it, compared with all the earth. Thismagnifies God's love to the world, that, though it is of such smallaccount and value with him, yet, for the redemption of it, he gave hisonly-begotten Son, John 3:16. The services of the church can make noaddition to him. Our souls must have perished for ever, if the only Sonof the Father had not given himself for us.<br>Is. 40:18-26 Whatever we esteem or love, fear or hope in, more thanGod, that creature we make equal with God, though we do not make imagesor worship them. He that is so poor, that he has scarcely a sacrificeto offer, yet will not be without a god of his own. They spared no costupon their idols; we grudge what is spent in the service of our God. Toprove the greatness of God, the prophet appeals to all ages andnations. Those who are ignorant of this, are willingly ignorant. Godhas the command of all creatures, and of all created things. Theprophet directs us to use our reason as well as our senses; to considerwho created the hosts of heaven, and to pay our homage to Him. Not onefails to fulfil his will. And let us not forget, that He spake all thepromises, and engaged to perform them.<br>Is. 40:27-31 The people of God are reproved for their unbelief anddistrust of God. Let them remember they took the names Jacob andIsrael, from one who found God faithful to him in all his straits. Andthey bore these names as a people in covenant with Him. Many foolishfrets, and foolish fears, would vanish before inquiry into the causes.It is bad to have evil thoughts rise in our minds, but worse to turnthem into evil words. What they had known, and had heard, wassufficient to silence all these fears and distrusts. Where God hadbegun the work of grace, he will perfect it. He will help those who, inhumble dependence on him, help themselves. As the day, so shall thestrength be. In the strength of Divine grace their souls shall ascendabove the world. They shall run the way of God's commandmentscheerfully. Let us watch against unbelief, pride, and self-confidence.If we go forth in our own strength, we shall faint, and utterly fall;but having our hearts and our hopes in heaven, we shall be carriedabove all difficulties, and be enabled to lay hold of the prize of ourhigh calling in Christ Jesus.
Isa 41:	<b>Overview</b><br>God's care of his people. (Is. 41:1-9) they are encouraged not to fear.(Is. 41:10-20) The vanity and folly of idolatry. (Is. 41:21-29)<br>Is. 41:1-9 Can any heathen god raise up one in righteousness, make whatuse of him he pleases, and make him victorious over the nations? TheLord did so with Abraham, or rather, he would do so with Cyrus. Sinnersencourage one another in the ways of sin; shall not the servants of theliving God stir up one another in his service? God's people are theseed of Abraham his friend. This is certainly the highest title evergiven to a mortal. It means that Abraham, by Divine grace, was madelike to God, and that he was admitted to communion with Him. Happy arethe servants of the Lord, whom he has called to be his friends, and towalk with him in faith and holy obedience. Let not such as have thusbeen favoured yield to fear; for the contest may be sharp, but thevictory shall be sure.<br>Is. 41:10-20 God speaks with tenderness; Fear thou not, for I am withthee: not only within call, but present with thee. Art thou weak? Iwill strengthen thee. Art thou in want of friends? I will help thee inthe time of need. Art thou ready to fall? I will uphold thee with thatright hand which is full of righteousness, dealing forth rewards andpunishments. There are those that strive with God's people, that seektheir ruin. Let not God's people render evil for evil, but wait God'stime. It is the worm Jacob; so little, so weak, so despised andtrampled on by every body. God's people are as worms, in humblethoughts of themselves, and in their enemies' haughty thoughts of them;worms, but not vipers, not of the serpent's seed. Every part of God'sword is calculated to humble man's pride, and to make him appear littlein his own eyes. The Lord will help them, for he is their Redeemer. TheLord will make Jacob to become a threshing instrument. God will makehim fit for use, new, and having sharp spikes. This has fulfilment inthe triumphs of the gospel of Christ, and of all faithful followers ofChrist, over the power of darkness. God has provided comforts to supplyall their wants, and to answer all their prayers. Our way to heavenlies through the wilderness of this world. The soul of man is in want,and seeks for satisfaction; but becomes weary of seeking that in theworld, which is not to be had in it. Yet they shall have a constantsupply, where one would least expect it. I will open rivers of grace,rivers of living water, which Christ spake of the Spirit, John 7:38,39.When God sets up his church in the Gentile wilderness, there shall be agreat change, as if thorns and briers were turned into cedars, andfir-trees, and myrtles. These blessings are kept for the poor inspirit, who long for Divine enlightening, pardon, and holiness. And Godwill render their barren souls fruitful in the grace of his Spirit,that all who behold may consider it.<br>Is. 41:21-29 There needs no more to show the folly of sin, than tobring to notice the reasons given in defence of it. There is nothing inidols worthy of regard. They are less than nothing, and worse thannothing. Let the advocates of other doctrines than that of salvationthrough Christ, bring their arguments. Can they tell of a cure forhuman depravity? Jehovah has power which cannot be withstood; this hewill make appear. But the certain knowledge of the future must be onlywith Jehovah, who fulfils his own plans. All prophecies, except thoseof the Bible, have been uncertain. In the work of redemption the Lordshowed himself much more than in the release of the Jews from Babylon.The good tidings the Lord will send in the gospel, is a mystery hidfrom ages and generations. A Deliverer is raised up for us, of noblername and greater power than the deliverer of the captive Jews. May webe numbered among his obedient servants and faithful friends.
Isa 42:	<b>Overview</b><br>The character and coming of Christ. (Is. 42:1-4) The blessings of hiskingdom. (Is. 42:5-12) The prevalence of true religion. (Is. 42:13-17)Unbelief and blindness reproved. (Is. 42:18-25)<br>Is. 42:1-4 This prophecy was fulfilled in Christ, Matt. 12:17. Let oursouls rely on him, and rejoice in him; then, for his sake, the Fatherwill be well-pleased with us. The Holy Spirit not only came, but restedupon him, and without measure. He patiently bore the contradiction ofsinners. His kingdom is spiritual; he was not to appear with earthlyhonours. He is tender of those oppressed with doubts and fears, as abruised reed; those who are as smoking flax, as the wick of a lampnewly lighted, which is ready to go out again. He will not despisethem, nor lay upon them more work or more suffering than they can bear.By a long course of miracles and his resurrection, he fully showed thetruth of his holy religion. By the power of his gospel and grace hefixes principles in the minds of men, which tend to make them wise andjust. The most distant nations wait for his law, wait for his gospel,and shall welcome it. If we would make our calling and election sure,and have the Father delight over us for good, we must behold, hear,believe in, and obey Christ.<br>Is. 42:5-12 The work of redemption brings back man to the obedience heowes to God as his Maker. Christ is the light of the world. And by hisgrace he opens the understandings Satan has blinded, and sets atliberty from the bondage of sin. The Lord has supported his church. Andnow he makes new promises, which shall as certainly be fulfilled as theold ones were. When the Gentiles are brought into the church, he isglorified in them and by them. Let us give to God those things whichare his, taking heed that we do not serve the creature more than theCreator.<br>Is. 42:13-17 The Lord will appear in his power and glory. He shall cry,in the preaching of his word. He shall cry aloud in the gospel woes,which must be preached with gospel blessings, to awaken a sleepingworld. He shall conquer by the power of his Spirit. And those thatcontradict and blaspheme his gospel, he shall put to silence and shame;and that which hinders its progress shall be taken out of the way. Tothose who by nature were blind, God will show the way to life andhappiness by Jesus Christ. They are weak in knowledge, but He will makedarkness light. They are weak in duty, but their way shall be plain.Those whom God brings into the right way, he will guide in it. Thispassage is a prophecy, and is also applicable to every believer; forthe Lord will never leave nor forsake them.<br>Is. 42:18-25 Observe the call given to this people, and the charactergiven of them. Multitudes are ruined for want of observing that whichthey cannot but see; they perish, not through ignorance, butcarelessness. The Lord is well-pleased in the making known his ownrighteousness. For their sins they were spoiled of all theirpossessions. This fully came to pass in the destruction of the Jewishnation. There is no resisting, nor escaping God's anger. See themischief sin makes; it provokes God to anger. And those not humbled bylesser judgments, must expect greater. Alas! how many professedChristians are blind as the benighted heathen! While the Lord iswell-pleased in saving sinners through the righteousness of Christ hewill also glorify his justice, by punishing all proud despisers. SeeingGod has poured out his wrath on his once-favoured people, because oftheir sins, let us fear, lest a promise being left us of entering intohis rest, any of us should be found to come short of it.
Isa 43:	<b>Overview</b><br>God's unchangeable love for his people. (Is. 43:1-7) Apostates andidolaters addressed. (Is. 43:8-13) The deliverance from Babylon, andthe conversion of the Gentiles. (Is. 43:14-21) Admonition to repent ofsin. (Is. 43:22-28)<br>Is. 43:1-7 God's favour and good-will to his people speak abundantcomfort to all believers. The new creature, wherever it is, is of God'sforming. All who are redeemed with the blood of his Son, he has setapart for himself. Those that have God for them need not fear who orwhat can be against them. What are Egypt and Ethiopia, all their livesand treasures, compared with the blood of Christ? True believers areprecious in God's sight, his delight is in them, above any people.Though they went as through fire and water, yet, while they had Godwith them, they need fear no evil; they should be born up, and broughtout. The faithful are encouraged. They were to be assembled from everyquarter. And with this pleasing object in view, the prophet againdissuades from anxious fears.<br>Is. 43:8-13 Idolaters are called to appear in defence of their idols.Those who make them, and trust in them, are like unto them. They havethe shape and faculties of men; but they have not common sense. ButGod's people know the power of his grace, the sweetness of hiscomforts, the kind care of his providence, and the truth of hispromise. All servants of God can give such an account of what he haswrought in them, and done for them, as may lead others to know andbelieve his power, truth, and love<br>Is. 43:14-21 The deliverance from Babylon is foretold, but there isreference to greater events. The redemption of sinners by Christ, theconversion of the Gentiles, and the recall of the Jews, are described.All that is to be done to rescue sinners, and to bring the believer toglory, is little, compared with that wondrous work of love, theredemption of man.<br>Is. 43:22-28 Those who neglect to call upon God, are weary of him. TheMaster tired not the servants with his commands, but they tired himwith disobedience. What were the riches of God's mercy toward them? I,even I, am he who yet blotteth out thy transgressions. This encouragesus to repent, because there is forgiveness with God, and shows thefreeness of Divine mercy. When God forgives, he forgets. It is not forany thing in us, but for his mercies' sake, his promise' sake;especially for his Son's sake. He is pleased to reckon it his honour.Would man justify himself before God? The attempt is desperate: ourfirst father broke the covenant, and we all have copied his example. Wehave no reason to expect pardon, except we seek it by faith in Christ;and that is always attended by true repentance, and followed by newnessof life, by hatred of sin, and love to God. Let us then put him inremembrance of the promises he has made to the penitent, and thesatisfaction his Son has made for them. Plead these with him inwrestling for pardon; and declare these things, that thou mayest bejustified freely by his grace. This is the only way, and it is a sureway to peace.
Isa 44:	<b>Overview</b><br>Here are promises of the influences of the Holy Spirit. (Is. 44:1-8) Anexposure of the folly of idolatry. (Is. 44:9-20) Also the deliveranceof God's people. (Is. 44:21-28)<br>Is. 44:1-8 Israel is here called Jeshurun, which means "the uprightone." Such only are Israelites indeed, in whom is no guile. Those thatserve God he will own. He will help them over difficulties, and intheir services. Water is the emblem of the Holy Spirit; as waterrefreshes, cleanses, and makes the earth fruitful, so do his influencesthe soul. This gift of the Holy Ghost is the great blessing, theplentiful pouring out of which God kept for the latter days. Where Godgives his Spirit, he will give all other blessings. Hereby shall be agreat increase of the church; thus it shall be spread to distantplaces. Was there any other Rock, or Protector, that could defend them?None besides could foretell these things to come, of which God by hisprophets gave notice. All was set in order in the Divine predictions,as well as in the Divine purposes. Could any other have done so? Whocan compare with Israel's Redeemer and King?<br>Is. 44:9-20 Image-making is described, to expose the folly ofidolaters. Though a man had used part of a log for fuel, he fell downbefore an image made of the remainder, praying it to deliver him. Mangreatly dishonours God, when he represents him after the image of man.Satan blinds the eyes of unbelievers, causing absurd reasonings inmatters of religion. Whether men seek happiness in worldly things, orrun into unbelief, superstition, or any false system, they feed onashes. A heart deceived by pride, love of sin, and departure from God,turns men aside from his holy truth and worship. While the affectionsare depraved, a man holds fast the lie as his best treasure. Are ourhearts set upon the wealth of the world and its pleasures? They willcertainly prove a lie. If we trust to outward professions and doings,as if those would save us, we deceive ourselves. Self-suspicion is thefirst step towards self-deliverance. He that would deliver his soul,must question his conscience, Is there not a lie in my right hand?<br>Is. 44:21-28 Return unto me. It is the great concern of those who havebackslidden from God, like the Jews of old, to hasten their return tohim. The work of redemption wrought for us by Christ, encourages tohope for all blessings from him. Our transgressions and our sins are asa thick cloud between heaven and earth: sins separate between us andGod; they threaten a storm of wrath. When God pardons sin, he blotsout, he dispels this cloud, this thick cloud, so that the way to heavenis open again. The cloud is scattered by the Sun of righteousness; itis quite gone. The comforts that flow into the soul when sin ispardoned, are like clear shining after clouds and rain. Let not Israelbe discouraged; nothing is too hard for God: having made all, he canmake what use he pleases of any. Those that learn to know Christ, seeall knowledge to be foolishness, in comparison with the knowledge ofhim. And his enemies will find their counsels turned into foolishness,and themselves taken in their craftiness. The exact fulfilling theprophecies of Scripture confirms the truth of the whole, and proves itsDivine origin. The particular favours God designed for his people incaptivity, were foretold here, long before they went into captivity.Very great difficulties would be in the way of their deliverance; butit is promised that by Divine power they should all be removed. Godknew who should be the Deliverer of his people; and let his church knowit, that when they heard such a name talked of, they might know theirredemption drew nigh. It is the greatest honour of the greatest men, tobe employed as instruments of the Divine favour to his people. Inthings wherein men serve themselves, and look no further, God makesthem do all his pleasure. And a nobler Shepherd than Cyrus does hisFather's will, till his work is fully completed.
Isa 45:	<b>Overview</b><br>The deliverance of the Jews by Cyrus. (Is. 45:1-4) God calls forobedience to his almighty power. (Is. 45:5-10) The settlement of hispeople. (Is. 45:11-19) The conversion of the Gentiles. (Is. 45:20-25)<br>Is. 45:1-4 Cyrus is called God's anointed; he was designed andqualified for his great service by the counsel of God. The gates ofBabylon which led to the river, were left open the night that Cyrusmarched his army into the empty channel. The Lord went before him,giving entrance to the cities he besieged. He gave him also treasures,which had been hidden in secret places. The true God was to Cyrus anunknown God; yet God foreknew him; he called him by his name. The exactfulfilment of this must have shown Cyrus that Jehovah was the only trueGod, and that it was for the sake of Israel that he was prospered. Inall the changes of states and kingdoms, God works out the good of hischurch.<br>Is. 45:5-10 There is no God beside Jehovah. There is nothing donewithout him. He makes peace, put here for all good; and creates evil,not the evil of sin, but the evil of punishment. He is the Author ofall that is true, holy, good, or happy; and evil, error, and misery,came into the world by his permission, through the wilful apostacy ofhis creatures, but are restrained and overruled to his righteouspurpose. This doctrine is applied, for the comfort of those thatearnestly longed, yet quietly waited, for the redemption of Israel. Theredemption of sinners by the Son of God, and the pouring out theSpirit, to give success to the gospel, are chiefly here intended. Wemust not expect salvation without righteousness; together the Lord hathcreated them. Let not oppressors oppose God's designs for his people.Let not the poor oppressed murmur, as if God dealt unkindly with them.Men are but earthen pots; they are broken potsherds, and are very muchmade so by mutual contentions. To contend with Him is as senseless asfor clay to find fault with the potter. Let us turn God's promises intoprayers, beseeching him that salvation may abound among us, and let usrest assured that the Judge of all the earth will do right.<br>Is. 45:11-19 Believers may ask in prayer for what they need; if fortheir good, it will not be withheld. But how common to hear God calledto account for his dealings with man! Cyrus provided for the returningJews. Those redeemed by Christ shall be provided for. The restorationwould convince many, and convert some; and all that truly join theLord, find his service perfect freedom. Though God be his people's Godand Saviour, yet sometimes he lays them under his frowns; but let themwait upon the Lord who hides his face. There is a world without end;and it will be well or ill with us, according as it shall be with us inthat world. The Lord we serve and trust, is God alone. All that God hassaid is plain, satisfactory, and just. As God in his word calls us toseek him, so he never denied believing prayers, nor disappointedbelieving expectations. He gives grace sufficient, and comfort andsatisfaction of soul.<br>Is. 45:20-25 The nations are exhorted to draw near to Jehovah. Nonebesides is able to help; he is the Saviour, who can save without theassistance of any, but without whom none can save. If the heart isbrought into the obedience of Christ, the knee will cheerfully obey hiscommands. To Christ men shall come from every nation for blessings; allthat hate his cause shall be put to shame, and all believers shallrejoice in him as their Friend and Portion. All must come to him: maywe now come to him as the Lord our Righteousness, walking according tohis commandments.
Isa 46:	<b>Overview</b><br>The idols could not save themselves, but God saves his people. (Is.46:1-4) The folly of worshipping idols. (Is. 46:5-13)<br>Is. 46:1-4 The heathen insulted the Jews, as if their idols Bel andNebo were too hard for Jehovah. But their worshippers cannot help them;both the idols and the idolaters are gone into captivity. Let not God'speople be afraid of either. Those things from which ungodly men expectsafety and happiness, will be found unable to save them from death andhell. The true God will never fail his worshippers. The history of thelife of every believer is a kind of abstract of the history of Israel.Our spiritual life is upheld by his grace, as constantly as our naturallife by his providence. And God will never leave them. The Author willbe the Finisher of their well-being, when, by decays, they need help asmuch as in infancy. This promise to Israel, enfeebled and grown old asa nation, is applicable to every aged follower of Christ. Whencompassed about with infirmities, and perhaps those around begin togrow weary of you, yet I am He that I have promised to be, He that youwould have me to be. I will bear you up; carry you on in your way, andcarry you home at last. If we learn to trust in and love him, we neednot be anxious about our remaining days or years; he will still providefor us and watch over us, both as the creatures of his power, and asnew-created by his Spirit.<br>Is. 46:5-13 Here the folly of those who made idols, and then prayed tothem, is exposed. How does the profuseness of idolaters shame theniggardliness of many who call themselves God's servants, but are for areligion which costs them nothing! The service of sin always costs agreat deal. God puts it to them what senseless, helpless things idolsare. Let, then, the Jews show themselves men, avoiding suchabominations. Many Scripture prophecies, delivered long ago, are notyet fulfilled; but the fulfilling of some is an earnest that the restwill come to pass. Nothing can help more to make us easy, than to beassured that God will do all his pleasure. Even those who know not andmind not God's revealed will, are called and used to fulfil thecounsels of his secret will. Heaven and earth shall pass away, soonerthan one tittle of the word of God. Obstinate sinners are addressed.Such were far from acceptance, but they were summoned to hearken to theword of the Lord. The salvation of a sinner begins with a humble andcontrite heart, that trembles at God's word, with godly sorrow workingtrue repentance, and faith in his mercy, through the obedience untodeath of our Divine Surety. Christ, as the Divine righteousness andsalvation to his people, would come in the appointed time. Hissalvation abides in his church for all believers.
Isa 47:	<b>Overview</b><br>God's judgments on Babylon. (Is. 47:1-6) Carelessness and confidenceshall not prevent the evil. (Is. 47:7-15)<br>Is. 47:1-6 Babylon is represented under the emblem of a female in deepdistress. She was to be degraded and endure sufferings; and isrepresented sitting on the ground, grinding at the handmill, the lowestand most laborious service. God was righteous in his vengeance, andnone should interpose. The prophet exults in the Lord of hosts, as theRedeemer and Holy One of Israel. God often permits wicked men toprevail against his people; but those who cruelly oppress them will bepunished.<br>Is. 47:7-15 Let us beware of acting and speaking as Babylon did; oftrusting in tyranny and oppression; of boasting as to our abilities,relying on ourselves, and ascribing success to our own prudence andwisdom; lest we partake of her plagues. Those in the height ofprosperity, are apt to fancy themselves out of the reach of adversity.It is also common for sinners to think they shall be safe, because theythink to be secret in wicked ways. But their security shall be theirruin. Let us draw from such passages as the foregoing, those lessons ofhumility and trust in God which they convey. If we believe the word ofGod, we may know how it will be with the righteous and the wicked toall eternity. We may learn how to escape the wrath to come, to glorifyGod, to have peace through life, hope in death, and everlastinghappiness. Let us then stand aloof from all delusions.
Isa 48:	<b>Overview</b><br>The Jews reproved for their idolatry. (Is. 48:1-8) Yet deliverance ispromised them. (Is. 48:9-15) Solemn warnings of judgment upon those whopersisted in evil. (Is. 48:16-22)<br>Is. 48:1-8 The Jews valued themselves on descent from Jacob, and usedthe name of Jehovah as their God. They prided themselves respectingJerusalem and the temple, yet there was no holiness in their lives. Ifwe are not sincere in religion, we do but take the name of the Lord invain. By prophecy they were shown how God would deal with them, longbefore it came to pass. God has said and done enough to prevent men'sboasting of themselves, which makes the sin and ruin of the proudworse; sooner or later every mouth shall be stopped, and all becomesilent before Him. We are all born children of disobedience. Whereoriginal sin is, actual sin will follow. Does not the conscience ofevery man witness to the truth of Scripture? May the Lord prove us, andrender us doers of the word.<br>Is. 48:9-15 We have nothing ourselves to plead with God, why he shouldhave mercy upon us. It is for his praise, to the honour of his mercy,to spare. His bringing men into trouble was to do them good. It was torefine them, but not as silver; not so thoroughly as men refine silver.If God should take that course, they are all dross, and, as such, mightjustly be put away. He takes them as refined in part only. Many havebeen brought home to God as chosen vessels, and a good work of gracebegun in them, in the furnace of affliction. It is comfort to God'speople, that God will secure his own honour, therefore work deliverancefor them. And if God delivers his people, he cannot be at a loss forinstruments to be employed. God has formed a plan, in which, for hisown sake, and the glory of his grace, he saves all that come to Him.<br>Is. 48:16-22 The Holy Spirit qualifies for service; and those may speakboldly, whom God and his Spirit send. This is to be applied to Christ.He was sent, and he had the Spirit without measure. Whom God redeems,he teaches; he teaches to profit by affliction, and then makes thempartakers of his holiness. Also, by his grace he leads them in the wayof duty; and by his providence he leads in the way of deliverance. Goddid not afflict them willingly. If their sins had not turned them away,their peace should have been always flowing and abundant. Spiritualenjoyments are ever joined with holiness of life and regard to God'swill. It will make the misery of the disobedient the more painful, tothink how happy they might have been. And here is assurance given ofsalvation out of captivity. Those whom God designs to bring home tohimself, he will take care of, that they want not for their journey.This is applicable to the grace laid up for us in Jesus Christ, fromwhom all good flows to us, as the water to Israel out of the rock, forthat Rock was Christ. The spiritual blessings of redemption, and therescue of the church from antichristian tyranny, are here pointed to.But whatever changes take place, the Lord warned impenitent sinnersthat no good would come to them; that inward anguish and outwardtrouble, which spring from guilt and from the Divine wrath, must betheir portion for ever.
Isa 49:	<b>Overview</b><br>The unbelief and rejection of the Jews. (Is. 49:1-6) Gracious promiseto the Gentiles. (Is. 49:7-12) God's love to the church. (Is. 49:13-17)Its increase. (Is. 49:18-23) And deliverance. (Is. 49:24-26)<br>Is. 49:1-6 The great Author of redemption shows the authority for hiswork. The sword of his word slays the lusts of his people, and all atenmity with them. His sharp arrows wound the conscience; but all thesewounds will be healed, when the sinner prays to him for mercy. But eventhe Redeemer, who spake as never man spake in his personal ministry,often seemed to labour in vain. And if Jacob will not be brought backto God, and Israel will not be gathered, still Christ will be glorious.This promise is in part fulfilled in the calling of the Gentiles. Menperish in darkness. But Christ enlightens men, and so makes them holyand happy.<br>Is. 49:7-12 The Father is the Lord, the Redeemer, and Holy One ofIsrael, as sending the Son to be the Redeemer. Man, whom he came tosave, put contempt upon him. To this he submitted for our salvation. Heis a pledge for all the blessings of the covenant; in him God wasreconciling the world to himself. Pardoning mercy is a release from thecurse of the law; renewing grace is a release from the dominion of sin:both are from Christ. He saith to those in darkness, Show yourselves.Not only see, but be seen, to the glory of God, and your own comforts.Though there are difficulties in the way to heaven, yet the grace ofGod will carry us over them, and make even the mountains a way. Thisdenotes the free invitations and the encouraging promises of thegospel, and the outpouring of the Spirit.<br>Is. 49:13-17 Let there be universal joy, for God will have mercy uponthe afflicted, because of his compassion; upon his afflicted, becauseof his covenant. We have no more reason to question his promise andgrace, than we have to question his providence and justice. Be assuredthat God has a tender affection for his church and people; he would nothave them to be discouraged. Some mothers do neglect their children;but God's compassions to his people, infinitely exceed those of thetenderest parents toward their children. His setting them as a mark onhis hand, or a seal upon his arm, denotes his being ever mindful ofthem. As far as we have scriptural evidence that we belong to hisransomed flock, we may be sure that he will never forsake us. Let usthen give diligence to make our calling and election sure, and rejoicein the hope and glory of God.<br>Is. 49:18-23 Zion is addressed as an afflicted widow, bereaved of herchildren. Numbers flock to her, and she is assured that they come to bea comfort to her. There are times when the church is desolate and fewin number; yet its desolations shall not last for ever, and God willrepair them. God can raise up friends for returning Israelites, evenamong Gentiles. They shall bring their children, and make them thychildren. Let all deal tenderly and carefully with young converts andbeginners in religion. Princes shall protect the church. It shallappear that God is the sovereign Lord of all. And those who in theexercise of faith, hope, and patience, wait on God for the fulfilmentof his promises, shall never be confounded.<br>Is. 49:24-26 We were lawful captives to the justice of God, yetdelivered by a price of unspeakable value. Here is an express promise:Even the prey of the terrible shall be delivered. We may here viewSatan deprived of his prey, bound and cast into the pit; and all thepowers that have combined to enslave, persecute, or corrupt the church,are destroyed; that all the earth may know that our Saviour andRedeemer is Jehovah, the mighty One of Jacob. And every effort we maketo rescue our fellow-sinners from the bondage of Satan, is, in somedegree, helping forward that great change.
Isa 50:	<b>Overview</b><br>The rejection of the Jews. (Is. 50:1-3) The sufferings and exaltationof the Messiah. (Is. 50:4-9) Consolation to the believer, and warningto the unbeliever. (Is. 50:10,11)<br>Is. 50:1-3 Those who have professed to be people of God, and seem to bedealt severely with, are apt to complain, as if God had been hard withthem. Here is an answer for such murmurings; God never deprived any oftheir advantages, except for their sins. The Jews were sent intoBabylon for their idolatry, a sin which broke the covenant; and theywere at last rejected for crucifying the Lord of glory. God called onthem to leave their sins, and prevent their own ruin. Last of all, theSon came to his own, but his own received him not. When God calls mento happiness, and they will not answer, they are justly left to bemiserable. To silence doubts concerning his power, proofs of it aregiven. The wonders which attended his sufferings and death, proclaimedthat he was the Son of God, Matt. 27:54.<br>Is. 50:4-9 As Jesus was God and man in one person, we find himsometimes speaking, or spoken of, as the Lord God; at other times, asman and the servant of Jehovah. He was to declare the truths whichcomfort the broken, contrite heart, those weary of sin, harassed withafflictions. And as the Holy Spirit was upon him, that he might speakas never man spake; so the same Divine influence daily wakened him topray, to preach the gospel, and to receive and deliver the whole willof the Father. The Father justified the Son when he accepted thesatisfaction he made for the sin of man. Christ speaks in the name ofall believers. Who dares to be an enemy to those unto whom he is aFriend? or who will contend with those whom he is an Advocate? Thus St.Paul applies it, Rom. 8:33.<br>Is. 50:10,11 A child of God is afraid of incurring his displeasure.This grace usually appears most in believers when in darkness, whenother graces appear not. Those that truly fear God, obey the voice ofChrist. A sincere servant of God may for a long time be without viewsof eternal happiness. What is likely to be an effectual cure in thissad case? Let him trust in the name of the Lord; and let him stayhimself upon the promises of the covenant, and build his hopes on them.Let him trust in Christ, trust in that name of his, The Lord ourRighteousness; stay himself upon God as his God, in and through aMediator. Presuming sinners are warned not to trust in themselves.Their own merit and sufficiency are light and heat to them.Creature-comforts are as sparks, short-lived, and soon gone; yet thechildren of this world, while they last, seek to warm themselves bythem, and walk with pride and pleasure in the light of them. Those thatmake the world their comfort, and their own righteousness theirconfidence, will certainly meet with bitterness in the end. A godlyman's way may be dark, but his end shall be peace and everlastinglight. A wicked man's way may be pleasant, but his end and abode forever will be utter darkness.
Isa 51:	<b>Overview</b><br>Exhortations to trust the Messiah. (Is. 51:1-3) The power of God, andthe weakness of man. (Is. 51:4-8) Christ defends his people. (Is.51:9-16) Their afflictions and deliverances. (Is. 51:17-23)<br>Is. 51:1-3 It is good for those privileged by the new birth, toconsider that they were shapen in sin. This should cause low thoughtsof ourselves, and high thoughts of Divine grace. It is the greatestcomfort to be made serviceable to the glory of God. The more holinessmen have, and the more good they do, the more gladness they have. Letus seriously reflect upon our guilt. To do so will tend to keep theheart humble, and the conscience awake and tender. They make Christmore precious to the soul, and give strength to our attempts andprayers for others.<br>Is. 51:4-8 The gospel of Christ shall be preached and published. Howshall we escape if we neglect it? There is no salvation withoutrighteousness. The soul shall, as to this world, vanish like smoke, andthe body be thrown by like a worn-out garment. But those whosehappiness is in Christ's righteousness and salvation, will have thecomfort of it when time and days shall be no more. Clouds darken thesun, but do not stop its course. The believer will enjoy his portion,while revilers of Christ are in darkness<br>Is. 51:9-16 The people whom Christ has redeemed with his blood, as wellas by his power, will obtain joyful deliverance from every enemy. Hethat designs such joy for us at last, will he not work such deliverancein the mean time, as our cases require? In this world of changes, it isa short step from joy to sorrow, but in that world, sorrow shall nevercome in view. They prayed for the display of God's power; he answersthem with consolations of his grace. Did we dread to sin against God,we should not fear the frowns of men. Happy is the man that fears Godalways. And Christ's church shall enjoy security by the power andprovidence of the Almighty.<br>Is. 51:17-23 God calls upon his people to mind the things that belongto their everlasting peace. Jerusalem had provoked God, and was made totaste the bitter fruits. Those who should have been her comforters,were their own tormentors. They have no patience by which to keeppossesion of their own souls, nor any confidence in God's promise, bywhich to keep possession of its comfort. Thou art drunken, not asformerly, with the intoxicating cup of Babylon's idolatries, but withthe cup of affliction. Know, then, the cause of God's people may for atime seem as lost, but God will protect it, by convincing theconscience, or confounding the projects, of those that strive againstit. The oppressors required souls to be subjected to them, that everyman should believe and worship as they would have them. But all theycould gain by violence was, that people were brought to outwardhypocritical conformity, for consciences cannot be forced.
Isa 52:	<b>Overview</b><br>The welcome news of Christ's kingdom. (Is. 52:1-12) The humiliation ofthe Messiah. (Is. 52:13-15)<br>Is. 52:1-12 The gospel proclaims liberty to those bound with fears. Letthose weary and heavy laden under the burden of sin, find relief inChrist, shake themselves from the dust of their doubts and fears, andloose themselves from those bands. The price paid by the Redeemer forour salvation, was not silver or gold, or corruptible things, but hisown precious blood. Considering the freeness of this salvation, and howhurtful to temporal comfort sins are, we shall more value theredemption which is in Christ. Do we seek victory over every sin,recollecting that the glory of God requires holiness in every followerof Christ? The good news is, that the Lord Jesus reigns. Christ himselfbrought these tidings first. His ministers proclaim these good tidings:keeping themselves clean from the pollutions of the world, they arebeautiful to those to whom they are sent. Zion's watchmen couldscarcely discern any thing of God's favour through the dark cloud oftheir afflictions; but now the cloud is scattered, they shall plainlysee the performance. Zion's waste places shall then rejoice; all theworld will have the benefit. This is applied to our salvation byChrist. Babylon is no place for Israelites. And it is a call to all inthe bondage of sin and Satan, to use the liberty Christ has proclaimed.They were to go with diligent haste, not to lose time nor linger; butthey were not to go with distrustful haste. Those in the way of duty,are under God's special protection; and he that believes this, will nothasten for fear.<br>Is. 52:13-15 Here begins that wonderful, minute, and faithfuldescription of the office, character, and glory of the Messiah, whichhas struck conviction to many of the most hardened unbelievers. Christis Wisdom itself; in the work of our redemption there appeared thewisdom of God in a mystery. Those that saw him, said, Surely never manlooked so miserable: never was sorrow like unto his sorrow. But Godhighly exalted him. That shall be discovered by the gospel of Christ,which could never be told in any other way. And Christ having once shedhis blood for sinners, its power still continues. May all opposers seethe wisdom of ceasing from their opposition, and be made partakers ofthe blood of sprinkling, and the baptism of the Holy Ghost; obeyinghim, and praising his salvation.
Isa 53:	<b>Overview</b><br>The person. (Is. 53:1-3) sufferings. (Is. 53:4-9) humiliation, andexaltation of Christ, are minutely described; with the blessings tomankind from his death. (Is. 53:10-12)<br>Is. 53:1-3 No where in all the Old Testament is it so plainly and fullyprophesied, that Christ ought to suffer, and then to enter into hisglory, as in this chapter. But to this day few discern, or willacknowledge, that Divine power which goes with the word. The authenticand most important report of salvation for sinners, through the Son ofGod, is disregarded. The low condition he submitted to, and hisappearance in the world, were not agreeable to the ideas the Jews hadformed of the Messiah. It was expected that he should come in pomp;instead of that, he grew up as a plant, silently, and insensibly. Hehad nothing of the glory which one might have thought to meet with him.His whole life was not only humble as to outward condition, but alsosorrowful. Being made sin for us, he underwent the sentence sin hadexposed us to. Carnal hearts see nothing in the Lord Jesus to desire aninterest in him. Alas! by how many is he still despised in his people,and rejected as to his doctrine and authority!<br>Is. 53:4-9 In these verses is an account of the sufferings of Christ;also of the design of his sufferings. It was for our sins, and in ourstead, that our Lord Jesus suffered. We have all sinned, and have comeshort of the glory of God. Sinners have their beloved sin, their ownevil way, of which they are fond. Our sins deserve all griefs andsorrows, even the most severe. We are saved from the ruin, to which bysin we become liable, by laying our sins on Christ. This atonement wasto be made for our sins. And this is the only way of salvation. Oursins were the thorns in Christ's head, the nails in his hands and feet,the spear in his side. He was delivered to death for our offences. Byhis sufferings he purchased for us the Spirit and grace of God, tomortify our corruptions, which are the distempers of our souls. We maywell endure our lighter sufferings, if He has taught us to esteem allthings but loss for him, and to love him who has first loved us.<br>Is. 53:10-12 Come, and see how Christ loved us! We could not put him inour stead, but he put himself. Thus he took away the sin of the world,by taking it on himself. He made himself subject to death, which to usis the wages of sin. Observe the graces and glories of his state ofexaltation. Christ will not commit the care of his family to any other.God's purposes shall take effect. And whatever is undertaken accordingto God's pleasure shall prosper. He shall see it accomplished in theconversion and salvation of sinners. There are many whom Christjustifies, even as many as he gave his life a ransom for. By faith weare justified; thus God is most glorified, free grace most advanced,self most abased, and our happiness secured. We must know him, andbelieve in him, as one that bore our sins, and saved us from sinkingunder the load, by taking it upon himself. Sin and Satan, death andhell, the world and the flesh, are the strong foes he has vanquished.What God designed for the Redeemer he shall certainly possess. When heled captivity captive, he received gifts for men, that he might givegifts to men. While we survey the sufferings of the Son of God, let usremember our long catalogue of transgressions, and consider him assuffering under the load of our guilt. Here is laid a firm foundationfor the trembling sinner to rest his soul upon. We are the purchase ofhis blood, and the monuments of his grace; for this he continuallypleads and prevails, destroying the works of the devil.
Isa 54:	<b>Overview</b><br>The increase of the church by the conversion of the Jews and Gentiles.(Is. 54:1-5) Its certain deliverance. (Is. 54:6-10) Its triumphantstate is described. (Is. 54:11-17)<br>Is. 54:1-5 Observe the low state of religion in the world, for a longtime before Christianity was brought in. But by preaching the gospel,multitudes were converted from idols to the living God. This is matterof great rejoicing to the church. The bounds of the church wereextended. Though its state on earth is but mean and movable, like atent or tabernacle, it is sometimes a growing state, and must beenlarged as the family increases. But the more numerous the churchgrows, the more she must fortify herself against errors andcorruptions. Thy Maker is thy Husband. Christ is the Holy One ofIsrael, the Mediator of the covenant made with the Old Testamentchurch. Long he had been called the God of Israel; but now he shall becalled the God of the whole earth. And he will cleanse from sin, andcause every true believer to rejoice in this sacred union. We never canenough admire this mercy, or duly value this privilege.<br>Is. 54:6-10 As God is slow to anger, so he is swift to show mercy. Andhow sweet the returns of mercy would be, when God should come andcomfort them! He will have mercy on them. God's gathering his peopletakes rise from his mercy, not any merit of theirs; and it is withgreat mercies, with everlasting kindness. The wrath is little, themercies great; the wrath for a moment, the kindness everlasting. We areneither to despond under afflictions, nor to despair of relief.Mountains have been shaken and removed, but the promises of God neverwere broken by any event. Mountains and hills also signify great men.Creature-confidences shall fail; but when our friends fail us, our Goddoes not. All this is alike applicable to the church at large, and toeach believer. God will rebuke and correct his people for sins; but hewill not cast them off. Let this encourage us to give the morediligence to make our calling and election sure.<br>Is. 54:11-17 Let the people of God, when afflicted and tossed, thinkthey hear God speaking comfortably to them by these words, takingnotice of their griefs and fears. The church is all glorious when fullof the knowledge of God; for none teaches like him. It is a promise ofthe teaching and gifts of the Holy Spirit. All that are taught of Godare taught to love one another. This seems to relate especially to theglorious times to succeed the tribulations of the church. Holiness,more than any thing, is the beauty of the church. God promisesprotection. There shall be no fears within; there shall be no fightingswithout. Military men value themselves on their splendid titles, butGod calls them, "Wasters made to destroy," for they make wasting anddestruction their business. He created them, therefore he will servehis own designs by them. The day is coming when God will reckon withwicked men for their hard speeches, Jude 1:15. Security and finalvictory are the heritage of each faithful servant of the Lord. Therighteousness by which they are justified, and the grace by which theyare sanctified, are the gift of God, and the effect of his speciallove. Let us beseech him to sanctify our souls, and to employ us in hisservice.
Isa 55:	<b>Overview</b><br>An invitation to receive freely the blessings of the Saviour. (Is.55:1-5) Gracious offers of pardon and peace. (Is. 55:6-13)<br>Is. 55:1-5 All are welcome to the blessings of salvation, to whom thoseblessings are welcome. In Christ there is enough for all, and enoughfor each. Those satisfied with the world, that see no need of Christ,do not thirst. They are in no uneasiness about their souls: but whereGod gives grace, he gives a thirst after it; and where he has given athirst after it, he will give it. Come to Christ, for he is theFountain opened, he is the Rock smitten. Come to holy ordinances, tothe streams that make glad the city of our God. Come to the healingwaters, come to the living waters, Rev. 22:17. Our Saviour referred tothis, John 7:37. Come, and buy; make it your own by application of thegrace of the gospel to yourselves. Come, and eat; make it still moreyour own, and enjoy it. The world comes short of our expectations; wepromise ourselves, at least, water in it, and we are disappointed; butChrist outdoes our expectations. We come to him, and we find wine andmilk. The gifts offered to us are such as no price can be set upon. Thethings offered are already paid for; for Christ purchased them at thefull price of his own blood, I Pet. 1:19. Our wants are beyond number,and we have nothing to supply them; if Christ and heaven are ours, wesee ourselves for ever indebted to free grace. Hearken diligently; letthe proud heart stoop; not only come, but accept God's offers. All thewealth and pleasure in the world, will not yield solid comfort andcontent to the soul. They do not satisfy even the appetites of thebody; for all is vanity and vexation. Let the disappointments we meetwith in the world, help to drive us to Christ, and to seek forsatisfaction in him only. Then, and not before, we shall find rest forour souls. Hear, and your soul shall live. On what easy terms ishappiness offered us! By the sure mercies of David, we are tounderstand the Messiah. All his mercies are covenant mercies; they arepurchased by him, they are promised in him, and out of his hand theyare dispensed to us. We know not how to find the way to the waters, butChrist is given to be a Leader, a Commander, to show us what to do, andenable us to do it. Our business is to obey him, and follow him. Andthere is no coming to the Father but by him. He is the Holy One ofIsrael, true to his promises; and he has promised to glorify Christ, bygiving him the heathen for his inheritance.<br>Is. 55:6-13 Here is a gracious offer of pardon, and peace, and of allhappiness. It shall not be in vain to seek God, now his word is callingto us, and his Spirit is striving with us. But there is a day comingwhen he will not be found. There may come such a time in this life; itis certain that at death and judgment the door will be shut. There mustbe not only a change of the way, but a change of the mind. We mustalter our judgments about persons and things. It is not enough to breakoff from evil practices, we must strive against evil thoughts. Torepent is to return to our Lord, against whom we have rebelled. If wedo so, God will multiply to pardon, as we have multiplied to offend.But let none trifle with this plenteous mercy, or use it as an occasionto sin. Men's thoughts concerning sin, Christ, and holiness, concerningthis world and the other, vastly differ from God's; but in nothing morethan in the matter of pardon. We forgive, and cannot forget; but whenGod forgives sin, he remembers it no more. The power of his word in thekingdoms of providence and grace, is as certain as in that of nature.Sacred truth produces a spiritual change in the mind of men, whichneither rain nor snow can make on the earth. It shall not return to theLord without producing important effects. If we take a special view ofthe church, we shall find what great things God has done, and will dofor it. The Jews shall come to their own land; this shall represent theblessings promised. Gospel grace will make a great change in men.Delivered from the wrath to come, the converted sinner finds peace inhis conscience; and love constrains him to devote himself to theservice of his Redeemer. Instead of being profane, contentious,selfish, or sensual, behold him patient, humble, kind, and peaceable.The hope of helping in such a work should urge us to spread the gospelof salvation. And do thou help us, O Spirit of all truth, to have suchviews of the fulness, freeness, and greatness of the rich mercy inChrist, as may remove from us all narrow views of sovereign grace.
Isa 56:	<b>Overview</b><br>A charge to keep the Divine precepts. (Is. 56:1,2) Blessings promised.(Is. 56:3-8) Reproof to the careless watchmen, the teachers and rulersof the Jews. (Is. 56:9-12)<br>Is. 56:1,2 The Lord tells us what are his expectations of duty from us.Be honest and just in all dealings. Also strictly observe the sabbathday. To have the blessing of God upon employments all the week, makeconscience of keeping the sabbath holy. Have nothing to do with sin.Blessed is the man that keeps his hand from all things displeasing toGod and hurtful to his own soul. Those who, through the Spirit, waitfor the hope of righteousness by faith, will be found walking in waysof holy obedience.<br>Is. 56:3-8 Unbelief often suggests things to discourage believers,against which God has expressly guarded. Spiritual blessings areunspeakably better than having sons and daughters; for children are acare, and may prove a grief and shame, but the blessings we partake ofin God's house, are comforts which cannot be made bitter. Those wholove the Lord truly, will serve him faithfully, and then hiscommandments are not grievous. Three things are promised. Assistance: Iwill not only bid them welcome, but incline them to come. Acceptance,and comfort: though they came mourning to the house of prayer, theyshall go away rejoicing. They shall find ease by casting their caresand burdens upon God. Many a sorrowful spirit has been made joyful inthe house of prayer. The Gentiles shall be one body with the Jews,that, as Christ says, John 10:16, there may be one fold and oneShepherd. Thanks be to God that none are separated from him except bywilful sin and unbelief; and if we come to him, we shall be acceptedthrough the sacrifice of our great High Priest.<br>Is. 56:9-12 Desolating judgments are called for; and this severe rebukeof the rulers and teachers of the Jewish church, is applicable to otherages and places. It is bad with a people when their shepherds slumber,and are eager after the world. Let us pray the Great Shepherd to sendus pastors after his own heart, who will feed us with knowledge, thatwe may rejoice in his holy name, and that believers may be daily addedto the church.
Isa 57:	<b>Overview</b><br>The blessed death of the righteous. (Is. 57:1,2) The abominableidolatries of the Jewish nation. (Is. 57:3-12) Promises to the humbleand contrite. (Is. 57:13-21)<br>Is. 57:1,2 The righteous are delivered from the sting of death, notfrom the stroke of it. The careless world disregards this. Few lamentit as a public loss, and very few notice it as a public warning. Theyare taken away in compassion, that they may not see the evil, nor sharein it, nor be tempted by it. The righteous man, when he dies, entersinto peace and rest.<br>Is. 57:3-12 The Lord here calls apostates and hypocrites to appearbefore him. When reproved for their sins, and threatened withjudgments, they ridiculed the word of God. The Jews were guilty ofidolatry before the captivity; but not after that affliction. Theirzeal in the worship of false gods, may shame our indifference in theworship of the true God. The service of sin is disgraceful slavery;those who thus debase themselves to hell, will justly have theirportion there. Men incline to a religion that inflames their unholypassions. They are led to do any evil, however great or vile, if theythink it will atone for crimes, or purchase indulgence for somefavourite lust. This explains idolatry, whether pagan, Jewish, orantichristian. But those who set up anything instead of God, for theirhope and confidence, never will come to a right end. Those who forsakethe only right way, wander in a thousand by-paths. The pleasures of sinsoon tire, but never satisfy. Those who care not for the word of Godand his providences, show they have no fear of God. Sin profits not; itruins and destroys.<br>Is. 57:13-21 The idols and their worshippers shall come to nothing; butthose who trust in God's grace, shall be brought to the joys of heaven.With the Lord there is neither beginning of days, nor end of life, norchange of time. His name is holy, and all must know him as a holy God.He will have tender regard to those who bring their mind to theircondition, and dread his wrath. He will make his abode with those whosehearts he has thus humbled, in order to revive and comfort them. Whentroubles last long, even good men are tempted to entertain hardthoughts of God. Therefore He will not contend for ever, for he willnot forsake the work of his own hands, nor defeat the purchase of hisSon's blood. Covetousness is a sin that particularly lays men under theDivine displeasure. See the sinfulness of sin. See also that troublescannot reform men unless God's grace work in them. Peace shall bepublished, perfect peace. It is the fruit of preaching lips, andpraying lips. Christ came and preached peace to Gentiles, as well as tothe Jews; to after-ages, who were afar off in time, as well as to thoseof that age. But the wicked would not be healed by God's grace,therefore would not be healed by his comforts. Their ungoverned lustsand passions made them like the troubled sea. Also the terrors ofconscience disturbed their enjoyments. God hath said it, and all theworld cannot unsay it, That there is no peace to those who allowthemselves in any sin. If we are recovered from such an awful state, itis only by the grace of God. And the influences of the Holy Spirit, andthat new heart, from whence comes grateful praise, the fruit of ourlips, are his gift. Salvation, with all its fruits, hopes, andcomforts, is his work, and to him belongs all the glory. There is nopeace for the wicked man; but let the wicked forsake his way, and theunrighteous man his thoughts; and let him return to the Lord, and hewill have mercy upon him, and to our God, and he will abundantlypardon.
Isa 58:	<b>Overview</b><br>Hypocrisy reproved. (Is. 58:1,2) A counterfeit and a true fast, withpromises to real godliness, and, (Is. 58:3-12) to the keeping thesabbath. (Is. 58:13,14)<br>Is. 58:1,2 The Holy Spirit had hypocrites of every age in view.Self-love and timid Christians may say, Spare thyself; dislike to thecross and other motives will say, "Spare the rich and powerful;" butGod says, "Spare not:" and we must obey God, not men. We all needearnestly to pray for God's assistance in examining ourselves. Men maygo far toward heaven, yet come short; and they may go to hell with agood reputation.<br>Is. 58:3-12 A fast is a day to afflict the soul; if it does not expresstrue sorrow for sin, and does not promote the putting away of sin, itis not a fast. These professors had shown sorrow on stated oroccasioned fasts. But they indulged pride, covetousness, and malignantpassions. To be liberal and merciful is more acceptable to God thanmere fasting, which, without them, is vain and hypocritical. Many whoseem humble in God's house, are hard at home, and harass theirfamilies. But no man's faith justifies, which does not work by love.Yet persons, families, neighbourhoods, churches, or nations, showrepentance and sorrow for sin, by keeping a fast sincerely, and, fromright motives, repenting, and doing good works. The heavy yoke of sinand oppression must be removed. As sin and sorrow dry the bones andweaken the strongest human constitution; so the duties of kindness andcharity strengthen and refresh both body and mind. Those who do justlyand love mercy, shall have the comfort, even in this world. Good workswill bring the blessing of God, provided they are done from love to Godand man, and wrought in the soul by the Holy Spirit.<br>Is. 58:13,14 The sabbath is a sign between God and his professingpeople; his appointing it is a sign of his favour to them; and theirobserving it is a sign of their obedience to him. We must turn fromtravelling on that day; from doing our pleasure on that holy day,without the control and restraint of conscience; or from indulging inthe pleasures of sense. On sabbath days we must not follow ourcallings, or our pleasures. In all we say and do, we must put adifference between this day and other days. Even in Old Testament timesthe sabbath was called the Lord's day, and is fitly called so still;and for a further reason, it is the Lord Christ's day, Rev. 1:10. If wethus remember the sabbath day to keep it holy, we shall have thecomfort and profit of it, and have reason to say, It is good to drawnear to God.
Isa 59:	<b>Overview</b><br>Reproofs of sin and wickedness. (Is. 59:1-8) Confession of sin, andlamentation for the consequences. (Is. 59:9-15) Promises ofdeliverance. (Is. 59:16-21)<br>Is. 59:1-8 If our prayers are not answered, and the salvation we waitfor is not wrought for us, it is not because God is weary of hearingprayer, but because we are weary of praying. See here sin in truecolours, exceedingly sinful; and see sin in its consequences,exceedingly hurtful, separating from God, and so separating us, notonly from all good, but to all evil. Yet numbers feed, to their owndestruction, on infidel and wicked systems. Nor can their skill orcraft, in devising schemes, as the spider weaves its web, deliver orsave them. No schemes of self-wrought salvation shall avail those whodespise the Redeemer's robe of righteousness. Every man who isdestitute of the Spirit of Christ, runs swiftly to evil of some sort;but those regardless of Divine truth and justice, are strangers topeace.<br>Is. 59:9-15 If we shut our eyes against the light of Divine truth, itis just with God to hide from our eyes the things that belong to ourpeace. The sins of those who profess themselves God's people, are worsethan the sins of others. And the sins of a nation bring publicjudgments, when not restrained by public justice. Men may murmur undercalamities, but nothing will truly profit while they reject Christ andhis gospel.<br>Is. 59:16-21 This passage is connected with the following chapters. Itis generally thought to describe the coming of the Messiah, as theAvenger and Deliverer of his church. There was none to intercede withGod to turn away his wrath; none to interpose for the support ofjustice and truth. Yet He engaged his own strength and righteousnessfor his people. God will make his justice upon the enemies of hischurch and people plainly appear. When the enemy threatens to bear downall without control, then the Spirit of the Lord shall stop him, puthim to flight. He that has delivered, will still deliver. A far moreglorious salvation is promised to be wrought out by the Messiah in thefulness of time, which all the prophets had in view. The Son of Godshall come to us to be our Redeemer; the Spirit of God shall come to beour Sanctifier: thus the Comforter shall abide with the church forever, John 14:16. The word of Christ will always continue in the mouthsof the faithful; and whatever is pretended to be the mind of theSpirit, must be tried by the Scriptures. We must lament the progress ofinfidelity and impiety. But the cause of the Redeemer shall gain acomplete victory even on earth, and the believer will be more thanconqueror when the Lord receives him to his glory in heaven.
Isa 60:	<b>Overview</b><br>The glories of the church of God, when the fulness of the Gentilesshall come in. (Is. 60:1-8) and the Jews shall be converted andgathered from their dispersions. (Is. 60:9-14) and the kingdoms of thisworld shall become the kingdom of our Lord, and of his Christ. (Is.60:15-22)<br>Is. 60:1-8 As far as we have the knowledge of God in us, and the favourof God towards us, our light is come. And if God's glory is seen uponus to our honour, we ought, not only with our lips, but in our lives,to return its praise. We meet with nothing in the history of the Jewswhich can be deemed a fulfilment of the prophecy in this chapter; wemust conclude it relates principally to future events. It predicts thepurity and enlargement of the church. The conversion of souls is heredescribed. They fly to Christ, to the church, to the word andordinances, as doves to their own home; thither they fly for refuge andshelter, thither they fly for rest. What a pleasant sight to see poorsouls hastening to Christ!<br>Is. 60:9-14 God will be very gracious. We must begin with his promise,thence all mercies take rise. Many shall be brought into the church,even from far countries. Christ is always ready to receive all who cometo him; and the gate of mercy is always open, night and day. All thatare about the church shall be made serviceable to it. But those whowill not be subject to Christ's golden sceptre, to his word and Spirit,who will not be kept in by the laws and rules of his family, shall bebroken in pieces by his iron rod. The peculiar advantages of everynation, and of every description of men, shall join to beautify thechurch of Christ. We must suppose this to be accomplished in thebeauties of holiness, and the graces and comforts of the Spirit, withwhich gospel ordinances are adorned and enriched. Blessed be his name,the gates of Zion are ever open to returning sinners.<br>Is. 60:15-22 We must look for the full accomplishment in times andthings, exceeding those of the Old Testament church. The nations andtheir kings shall lay themselves out for the good of the church. Such asalvation, such a redemption, shall be wrought out for thee, asdiscovers itself to be the work of the Lord. Every thing shall bechanged for the better. In thy land shall no more be heard threats ofthose that do violence, nor complaints of those that suffer violence.Thy walls shall be means of safety, thy gates shall be written uponwith praises to God. In the close of this chapter are images andexpressions used in the description of the New Jerusalem, Rev. 21:23;22:5. Nothing can answer to this but some future glorious state of thechurch on earth, or the state of the church triumphant in heaven. Thosethat make God their only light, shall have him their all-sufficientlight. And the happiness shall know no change or alloy. No people onearth are all righteous; but there are no mixtures in heaven. Theyshall be wholly righteous. The spirits of just men shall there be madeperfect. The glory of the church shall be to the honour of God. When itshall be finished, it will appear a work of wonder. It may seem toodifficult to be brought about, but the God of almighty power hasundertaken it. It may seem to be delayed and put off; but the Lord willhasten it in the time appointed by his wisdom, though not in the timeprescribed by our folly. Let this hope cheer us under all difficulties,and stir us up to all diligence, that we may have an abundant entranceinto this everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.
Isa 61:	<b>Overview</b><br>The Messiah, his character and office. (Is. 61:1-3) His promises of thefuture blessedness of the church. (Is. 61:4-9) The church praises Godfor these mercies. (Is. 61:10,11)<br>Is. 61:1-3 The prophets had the Holy Spirit of God at times, teachingthem what to say, and causing them to say it; but Christ had the Spiritalways, without measure, to qualify him, as man, for the work to whichhe was appointed. The poor are commonly best disposed to receive thegospel, James 2:5; and it is only likely to profit us when receivedwith meekness. To such as are poor in spirit, Christ preached goodtidings when he said, Blessed are the meek. Christ's satisfaction isaccepted. By the dominion of sin in us, we are bound under the power ofSatan; but the Son is ready, by his Spirit, to make us free; and thenwe shall be free indeed. Sin and Satan were to be destroyed; and Christtriumphed over them on his cross. But the children of men, who standout against these offers, shall be dealt with as enemies. Christ was tobe a Comforter, and so he is; he is sent to comfort all who mourn, andwho seek to him, and not to the world, for comfort. He will do all thisfor his people, that they may abound in the fruits of righteousness, asthe branches of God's planting. Neither the mercy of God, the atonementof Christ, nor the gospel of grace, profit the self-sufficient andproud. They must be humbled, and led to know their own character andwants, by the Holy Spirit, that they may see and feel their need of thesinner's Friend and Saviour. His doctrine contains glad tidings indeedto those who are humbled before God.<br>Is. 61:4-9 Promises are here made to the Jews returned out ofcaptivity, which extend to all those who, through grace, are deliveredout of spiritual thraldom. An unholy soul is like a city that is brokendown, and has no walls, like a house in ruins; but by the power ofChrist's gospel and grace, it is fitted to be a habitation of God,through the Spirit. When, by the grace of God, we attain to holyindifference as to the affairs of this world; when, though our handsare employed about them, our hearts are not entangled with them, butpreserved entire for God and his service, then the sons of the alienare our ploughmen and vine-dressers. Those whom He sets at liberty, hesets to work. His service is perfect freedom; it is the greatesthonour. All believers are made, to our God, kings and priests; andalways ought to conduct themselves as such. Those who have the Lord fortheir portion, have reason to say, that they have worthy portion, andto rejoice in it. In the fulness of heaven's joys we shall receive morethan double for all our services and sufferings. God desires truth, andtherefore hates all injustice. Nor will it justify any man's robbery tosay, it was for burnt-offerings; and that robbery is most hateful whichis under this pretence. Let the children of godly parents be such, thatall may see the fruits of a good education; an answer to the prayersfor them, in the fruit of God's blessing.<br>Is. 61:10,11 Those only shall be clothed with the garments of salvationhereafter, that are covered with the robe of Christ's righteousnessnow, and by the sanctification of the Spirit have God's image renewedupon them. These blessings shall spring forth for ages to come, as thefruits of the earth. So duly, so constantly, and with such advantage tomankind, will the Lord God cause righteousness and praise to springforth. They shall spread far; the great salvation shall be publishedand proclaimed, to the ends of the earth. Let us be earnest in prayer,that the Lord God may cause that righteousness to spring forth amongus, which constitutes the excellence and glory of the Christianprofession.
Isa 62:	<b>Overview</b><br>God's care of his church and people. (Is. 62:1-5) The office ofministers in preaching the gospel. (Is. 62:6-9) Every hinderance shallbe removed from the way of salvation. (Is. 62:10-12)<br>Is. 62:1-5 The Son of God here assures his church of his unfailinglove, and his pleading for her under all trails and difficulties. Sheshall be called by a new name, a pleasant name, such as she was nevercalled by before. The state of true religion in the world, before thepreaching of the gospel, no man seemed to have any real concern for.God, by his grace, has wrought that in his church, which makes her hisdelight. Let us thence learn motives to holiness. If the Lord rejoicesover us, we should rejoice in his service.<br>Is. 62:6-9 God's professing people must be a praying people. He is notdispleased with us for being earnest, as men commonly are; he bids usto cry after him, and give him no rest, Luke 11:5,6. It is a sign thatGod is coming to a people in mercy, when he pours out a spirit ofprayer upon them. See how uncertain our creature-comforts are. See alsoGod's mercy in giving plenty, and peace to enjoy it. Let us delight inattending the courts of the Lord, that we may enjoy the consolations ofhis Spirit.<br>Is. 62:10-12 Way shall be made for Christ's salvation; all difficultiesshall be removed. He brings a reward of comfort and peace with him; buta work of humiliation and reformation before him; and they shall becalled, The holy people, and, The redeemed of the Lord. Holiness putshonour and beauty upon any place or person, makes them admired,beloved, and sought after. Many events may have been part fulfilmentsof this, as earnests of more glorious times yet to come. The closeconnexion between the blessedness of the Jews and of the Gentiles, runsthrough the Scriptures. The Lord Jesus will complete his work, and henever will forsake one whom he has redeemed and sanctified.
Isa 63:	<b>Overview</b><br>Christ's victory over his enemies. (Is. 63:1-6) His mercy toward hischurch. (Is. 63:7-14) The prayer of the church. (Is. 63:15-19)<br>Is. 63:1-6 The prophet, in vision, beholds the Messiah returning intriumph from the conquest of his enemies, of whom Edom was a type.Travelling, not as wearied by the combat, but, in the greatness of hisstrength, prepared to overcome every opposing power. Messiah declaresthat he had been treading the wine-press of the wrath of God, Rev.14:19; 19:13, and by his own power, without any human help, he hadcrushed his obstinate opposers, for the day of vengeance was determinedon, being the appointed season for rescuing his church. Once, heappeared on earth in apparent weakness, to pour out his precious bloodas an atonement for our sins; but he will in due time appear in thegreatness of his strength. The vintage ripens apace; the day ofvengeance, fixed and determined on, approaches apace; let sinners seekto be reconciled to their righteous Judge, ere he brings down theirstrength to the earth. Does Christ say, "I come quickly?" let ourhearts reply, "Even so, come; let the year of the redeemed come."<br>Is. 63:7-14 The latter part of this chapter, and the whole of the next,seem to express the prayers of the Jews on their conversation. Theyacknowledge God's great mercies and favours to their nation. Theyconfess their wickedness and hardness of heart; they entreat hisforgiveness, and deplore the miserable condition under which they haveso long suffered. The only-begotten Son of the Father became the Angelor Messenger of his love; thus he redeemed and bare them withtenderness. Yet they murmured, and resisted his Holy Spirit, despisingand persecuting his prophets, rejecting and crucifying the promisedMessiah. All our comforts and hopes spring from the loving-kindness ofthe Lord, and all our miseries and fears from our sins. But he is theSaviour, and when sinners seek after him, who in other ages glorifiedhimself by saving and feeding his purchased flock, and leading themsafely through dangers, and has given his Holy Spirit to prosper thelabours of his ministers, there is good ground to hope they arediscovering the way of peace.<br>Is. 63:15-19 They beseech him to look down on the abject condition oftheir once-favoured nation. Would it not be glorious to his name toremove the veil from their hearts, to return to the tribes of hisinheritance? The Babylonish captivity, and the after-deliverance of theJews, were shadows of the events here foretold. The Lord looks downupon us in tenderness and mercy. Spiritual judgments are more to bedreaded than any other calamities; and we should most carefully avoidthose sins which justly provoke the Lord to leave men to themselves andto their deceiver. "Our Redeemer from everlasting" is thy name; thypeople have always looked upon thee as the God to whom they mightappeal. The Lord will hear the prayers of those who belong to him, anddeliver them from those not called by his name.
Isa 64:	<b>Overview</b><br>The church prays that God's power may be manifested. (Is. 64:1-5) Aconfession of sin, and afflictions bewailed. (Is. 64:6-12)<br>Is. 64:1-5 They desire that God would manifest himself to them and forthem, so that all may see it. This is applicable to the second comingof Christ, when the Lord himself shall descend from heaven. They pleadwhat God had used to do, and had declared his gracious purpose to do,for his people. They need not fear being disappointed of it, for it issure; or disappointed in it, for it is sufficient. The happiness of hispeople is bound up in what God has designed for them, and is preparingfor them, and preparing them for; what he has done or will do. Can webelieve this, and then think any thing too great to expect from histruth, power, and love? It is spiritual and cannot be comprehended byhuman understanding. It is ever ready. See what communion there isbetween a gracious God and a gracious soul. We must make conscience ofdoing our duty in every thing the Lord our God requires. Thou meetesthim; this speaks his freeness and forwardness in doing them good.Though God has been angry with us for our sins, and justly, yet hisanger has soon ended; but in his favour is life, which goes on andcontinues, and on that we depend for our salvation.<br>Is. 64:6-12 The people of God, in affliction, confess and bewail theirsins, owning themselves unworthy of his mercy. Sin is that abominablething which the Lord hates. Our deeds, whatever they may seem to be, ifwe think to merit by them at God's hand, are as rags, and will notcover us; filthy rags, and will but defile us. Even our few good worksin which there is real excellence, as fruits of the Spirit, are sodefective and defiled as done by us, that they need to be washed in thefountain open for sin and uncleanness. It bodes ill when prayer is keptback. To pray, is by faith to take hold of the promises the Lord hasmade of his good-will to us, and to plead them; to take hold of him,earnestly begging him not to leave us; or soliciting his return. Theybrought their troubles upon themselves by their own folly. Sinners areblasted, and then carried away, by the wind of their own iniquity; itwithers and then ruins them. When they made themselves as an uncleanthing, no wonder that God loathed them. Foolish and careless as we are,poor and despised, yet still Thou art our Father. It is the wrath of aFather we are under, who will be reconciled; and the relief our caserequires is expected only from him. They refer themselves to God. Theydo not say, "Lord, rebuke us not," for that may be necessary; but, "Notin thy displeasure." They state their lamentable condition. See whatruin sin brings upon a people; and an outward profession of holinesswill be no defence against it. God's people presume not to tell himwhat he shall say, but their prayer is, Speak for the comfort andrelief of thy people. How few call upon the Lord with their wholehearts, or stir themselves to lay hold upon him! God may delay for atime to answer our prayers, but he will, in the end, answer those whocall on his name and hope in his mercy.
Isa 65:	<b>Overview</b><br>The calling of the Gentiles, and the rejection of the Jews. (Is.65:1-7) The Lord would preserve a remnant. (Is. 65:8-10) Judgments uponthe wicked. (Is. 65:11-16) The future happy and flourishing state ofthe church. (Is. 65:17-25)<br>Is. 65:1-7 The Gentiles came to seek God, and find him, because theywere first sought and found of him. Often he meets some thoughtlesstrifler or profligate opposer, and says to him, Behold me; and a speedychange takes place. All the gospel day, Christ waited to be gracious.The Jews were bidden, but would not come. It is not without cause theyare rejected of God. They would do what most pleased them. Theygrieved, they vexed the Holy Spirit. They forsook God's temple, andsacrificed in groves. They cared not for the distinction between cleanand unclean meats, before it was taken away by the gospel. Perhaps thisis put for all forbidden pleasures, and all that is thought to begotten by sin, that abominable thing which the Lord hates. Christdenounced many woes against the pride and hypocrisy of the Jews. Theproof against them is plain. And let us watch against pride andself-preference, remembering that every sin, and the most secretthoughts of man's heart, are known and will be judged by God.<br>Is. 65:8-10 In the bunch of unripe grapes, at present of no value, thenew wine is contained. The Jews have been kept a distinct people, thatall may witness the fulfilment of ancient prophecies and promises.God's chosen, the spiritual seed of praying Jacob, shall inherit hismountains of bliss and joy, and be carried safe to them through thevale of tears. All things are for the display of God's glory in theredemption of sinners.<br>Is. 65:11-16 Here the different states of the godly and wicked, of theJews who believed, and of those who persisted in unbelief, are setagainst one another. They prepared a table for that troop of deitieswhich the heathen worship, and poured out drink-offerings to thatcountless number. Their worshippers spared no cost to honour them,which should shame the worshippers of the true God. See the malignityof sin; it is doing by choice what we know will displease God. In everyage and nation, the Lord leaves those who persist in doing evil, anddespise the call of the gospel. God's servants shall have the bread oflife, and shall want nothing good for them. But those who forsake theLord, shall be ashamed of vain confidence in their own righteousness,and the hopes they built thereon. Wordly people bless themselves in theabundance of this world's goods; but God's servants bless themselves inhim. He is their strength and portion. They shall honour him as the Godof truth. And it was promised that in him should all the families ofthe earth be blessed. They shall think themselves happy in having himfor their God, who made them forget their troubles.<br>Is. 65:17-25 In the grace and comfort believers have in and fromChrist, we are to look for this new heaven and new earth. The formerconfusions, sins and miseries of the human race, shall be no moreremembered or renewed. The approaching happy state of the church isdescribed under a variety of images. He shall be thought to die in hisyouth, and for his sins, who only lives to the age of a hundred years.The event alone can determine what is meant; but it is plain thatChristianity, if universal, would so do away violence and evil, asgreatly to lengthen life. In those happy days, all God's people shallenjoy the fruit of their labours. Nor will children then be the troubleof their parents, or suffer trouble themselves. The evil dispositionsof sinners shall be completely moritified; all shall live in harmony.Thus the church on earth shall be full of happiness, like heaven. Thisprophecy assures the servants of Christ, that the time approaches,wherein they shall be blessed with the undisturbed enjoyment of allthat is needful for their happiness. As workers together with God, letus attend his ordinances, and obey his commands.
Isa 66:	<b>Overview</b><br>God looks at the heart, and vengeance is threatened for guilt. (Is.66:1-4) The increase of the church, when Jew and Gentile shall begathered to the Redeemer. (Is. 66:5-14) Every enemy of the church shallbe destroyed, and the final ruin of ungodly men shall be seen. (Is.66:15-24)<br>Is. 66:1-4 The Jews gloried much in their temple. But what satisfactioncan the Eternal Mind take in a house made with men's hands? God has aheaven and an earth of his own making, and temples of man's making; buthe overlooks them, that he may look with favour to him who is poor inspirit and serious, self-abasing and self-denying; whose heart trulysorrows for sin: such a heart is a living temple for God. The sacrificeof the wicked is not only unacceptable, but a great offence to God. Andhe that now offers a sacrifice after the law, does in effect set asideChrist's sacrifice. He that burns incense, puts contempt upon theincense of Christ's intercession, and is as if he blessed an idol. Menshall be deceived by the vain confidences with which they deceivethemselves. Unbelieving hearts, and unpurified consciences, need nomore to make them miserable, than to have their own fears brought uponthem. Whatever men put in the place of the priesthood, atonement, andintercession of Christ, will be found hateful to God.<br>Is. 66:5-14 The prophet turns to those that trembled at God's word, tocomfort and encourage them. The Lord will appear, to the joy of thehumble believer, and to the confusion of hypocrites and persecutors.When the Spirit was poured out, and the gospel went forth from Zion,multitudes were converted in a little time. The word of God, especiallyhis promises, and ordinances, are the consolations of the church. Thetrue happiness of all Christians is increased by every convert broughtto Christ. The gospel brings with it, wherever it is received in itspower, such a river of peace, as will carry us to the ocean ofboundless and endless bliss. Divine comforts reach the inward man; thejoy of the Lord will be the strength of the believer. Both God's mercyand justice shall be manifested, and for ever magnified.<br>Is. 66:15-24 A prophetic declaration is given of the Lord's vengeanceon all enemies of his church, especially that of all antichristianopposers of the gospel in the latter days. Is. 66:19,20, set forth theabundance of means for conversion of sinners. These expressions arefigurative, and express the plentiful and gracious helps for bringingGod's elect home to Christ. All shall be welcome; and nothing shall bewanting for their assistance and encouragement. A gospel ministry shallbe set up in the church; they would have solemn worship before theLord. In the last verse the nature of the punishment of sinners in theworld to come is represented. Then shall the righteous and wicked beseparated. Our Saviour applies this to the everlasting misery andtorment of impenitent sinners in the future state. To the honour ofthat free grace which thus distinguishes them, let the redeemed of theLord, with humility, and not without holy trembling, sing triumphantsongs. With this affecting representation of the opposite states of therighteous and wicked, characters which include the whole human race,Isaiah concludes his prophecies. May God grant, for Christ's sake, thatour portion may be with those who fear and love his name, who cleave tohis truths, and persevere in every good work, looking to receive fromthe Lord Jesus Christ the gracious invitation, Come, ye blessed of myFather, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of theworld.
Jer 1:	<b>Overview</b><br>Jeremiah's call to the prophetic office. (Jer. 1:1-10) A vision of analmond-tree and of a seething-pot, Divine protection is promised. (Jer.1:11-19)<br>Jer. 1:1-10 Jeremiah's early call to the work and office of a prophetis stated. He was to be a prophet, not to the Jews only, but to theneighbouring nations. He is still a prophet to the whole world, and itwould be well if they would attend to these warnings. The Lord whoformed us, knows for what particular services and purposes he intendedus. But unless he sanctify us by his new-creating Spirit, we shallneither be fit for his holy service on earth, nor his holy happiness inheaven. It becomes us to have low thoughts of ourselves. Those who areyoung, should consider that they are so, and not venture beyond theirpowers. But though a sense of our own weakness and insufficiency shouldmake us go humbly about our work, it should not make us draw back whenGod calls us. Those who have messages to deliver from God, must notfear the face of man. The Lord, by a sign, gave Jeremiah such a gift aswas necessary. God's message should be delivered in his own words.Whatever wordly wise men or politicians may think, the safety ofkingdoms is decided according to the purpose and word of God.<br>Jer. 1:11-19 God gave Jeremiah a view of the destruction of Judah andJerusalem by the Chaldeans. The almond-tree, which is more forward inthe spring than any other, represented the speedy approach ofjudgments. God also showed whence the intended ruin should arise.Jeremiah saw a seething-pot boiling, representing Jerusalem and Judahin great commotion. The mouth or face of the furnace or hearth, wastoward the north; from whence the fire and fuel were to come. Thenorthern powers shall unite. The cause of these judgments was the sinof Judah. The whole counsel of God must be declared. The fear of God isthe best remedy against the fear of man. Better to have all men ourenemies than God our enemy; those who are sure they have God with them,need not, ought not to fear, whoever is against them. Let us pray thatwe may be willing to give up personal interests, and that nothing maymove us from our duty.
Jer 2:	<b>Overview</b><br>God expostulates with his people. (Jer. 2:1-8) Their revolt beyondexample. (Jer. 2:9-13) Guilt the cause of sufferings. (Jer. 2:14-19)The sins of Judah. (Jer. 2:20-28) Their false confidence. (Jer.2:29-37)<br>Jer. 2:1-8 Those who begin well, but do not persevere, will justly beupbraided with their hopeful and promising beginnings. Those who desertreligion, commonly oppose it more than those who never knew it. Forthis they could have no excuse. God's spiritual Israel must own theirobligations to him for safe conduct through the wilderness of thisworld, so dangerous to the soul. Alas, that many, who once appeareddevoted to the Lord, so live that their professions aggravate theircrimes! Let us be careful that we do not lose in zeal and fervency, aswe gain knowledge.<br>Jer. 2:9-13 Before God punishes sinners, he pleads with them, to bringthem to repentance. He pleads with us, what we should plead withourselves. Be afraid to think of the wrath and curse which will be theportion of those who throw themselves out of God's grace and favour.Grace in Christ is compared to water from a fountain, it being coolingand refreshing, cleansing and making fruitful: to living water, becauseit quickens dead sinners, revives drooping saints, supports andmaintains spiritual life, and issues in eternal life, and isever-flowing. To forsake this Fountain is the first evil; this is donewhen the people of God neglect his word and ordinances. They hewed themout broken cisterns, that could hold no water. Such are the world, andthe things in it; such are the inventions of men when followed anddepended on. Let us, with purpose of heart, cleave to the Lord only;whither else shall we go? How prone are we to forego the consolationsof the Holy Spirit, for the worthless joys of the enthusiast andhypocrite!<br>Jer. 2:14-19 Is Israel a servant? No, they are the seed of Abraham. Wemay apply this spiritually: Is the soul of man a slave? No, it is not;but has sold its own liberty, and enslaved itself to divers lusts andpassions. The Assyrian princes, like lions, prevailed against Israel.People from Egypt destroyed their glory and strength. They broughtthese calamities on themselves by departing from the Lord. The use andapplication of this is, Repent of thy sin, that thy correction may notbe thy ruin. What has a Christian to do in the ways of forbiddenpleasure or vain sinful mirth, or with the pursuits of covetousness andambition?<br>Jer. 2:20-28 Notwithstanding all their advantages, Israel had becomelike the wild vine that bears poisonous fruit. Men are often as muchunder the power of their unbridled desires and their sinful lusts, asthe brute beasts. But the Lord here warns them not to weary themselvesin pursuits which could only bring distress and misery. As we must notdespair of the mercy of God, but believe that to be sufficient for thepardon of our sins, so neither must we despair of the grace of God, butbelieve that it is able to subdue our corruptions, though ever sostrong.<br>Jer. 2:29-37 The nation had not been wrought upon by the judgements ofGod, but sought to justify themselves. The world is, to those who makeit their home and their portion, a wilderness and a land of darkness;but those who dwell in God, have the lines fallen to them in pleasantplaces. Here is the language of presumptuous sinners. The Jews had longthrown off serious thoughts of God. How many days of our lives passwithout suitable remembrance of him! The Lord was displeased with theirconfidences, and would not prosper them therein. Men employ all theiringenuity, but cannot find happiness in the way of sin, or excuse forit. They may shift from one sin to another, but none ever hardenedhimself against God, or turned from him, and prospered.
Jer 3:	<b>Overview</b><br>Exhortations to repentance. (Jer. 3:1-5) Judah more guilty than Israel.(Jer. 3:6-11) But pardon is promised. (Jer. 3:12-20) The children ofIsrael express their sorrow and repentance. (Jer. 3:21-25)<br>Jer. 3:1-5 In repentance, it is good to think upon the sins of which wehave been guilty, and the places and companies where they have beencommitted. How gently the Lord had corrected them! In receivingpenitents, he is God, and not man. Whatever thou hast said or donehitherto, wilt thou not from this time apply to me? Will not this graceof God overcome thee? Now pardon is proclaimed, wilt thou not take thebenefit? They will hope to find in him the tender compassions of aFather towards a returning prodigal. They will come to him as the Guideof their youth: youth needs a guide. Repenting sinners may encouragethemselves that God will not keep his anger to the end. All God'smercies, in every age, suggest encouragement; and what can be sodesirable for the young, as to have the Lord for their Father, and theGuide of their youth? Let parents daily direct their children earnestlyto seek this blessing.<br>Jer. 3:6-11 If we mark the crimes of those who break off from areligious profession, and the consequences, we see abundant reason toshun evil ways. It is dreadful to be proved more criminal than thosewho have actually perished in their sins; yet it will be small comfortin everlasting punishment, for them to know that others were viler thanthey.<br>Jer. 3:12-20 See God's readiness to pardon sin, and the blessingsreserved for gospel times. These words were proclaimed toward thenorth; to Israel, the ten tribes, captive in Assyria. They are directedhow to return. If we confess our sins, the Lord is faithful and just toforgive them. These promises are fully to come to pass in the bringingback the Jews in after-ages. God will graciously receive those thatreturn to him; and by his grace, he takes them out from among the rest.The ark of the covenant was not found after the captivity. The whole ofthat dispensation was to be done away, which took place after themultitude of believers had been greatly increased by the conversion ofthe Gentiles, and of the Israelites scattered among them. A happy stateof the church is foretold. He can teach all to call him Father; butwithout thorough change of heart and life, no man can be a child ofGod, and we have no security for not departing from Him.<br>Jer. 3:21-25 Sin is turning aside to crooked ways. And forgetting theLord our God is at the bottom of all sin. By sin we bring ourselvesinto trouble. The promise to those that return is, God will heal theirbackslidings, by his pardoning mercy, his quieting peace, and hisrenewing grace. They come devoting themselves to God. They comedisclaiming all expectations of relief and succour from any but theLord. Therefore they come depending upon him only. He is the Lord, andhe only can save. It points out the great salvation from sin JesusChrist wrought out for us. They come justifying God in their troubles,and judging themselves for their sins. True penitents learn to call sinshame, even the sin they have been most pleased with. True penitentslearn to call sin death and ruin, and to charge upon it all theysuffer. While men harden themselves in sin, contempt and misery aretheir portion: for he that covereth his sins shall not prosper, but hethat confesseth and forsaketh them, shall find mercy.
Jer 4:	<b>Overview</b><br>Exhortations and promises. (Jer. 4:1-2) Judah exhorted to repentance.(Jer. 4:3-4) Judgements denounced. (Jer. 4:5-18) The approaching ruinof Judah. (Jer. 4:19-31)<br>Jer. 4:1,2 The first two verses should be read with the last chapter.Sin must be put away out of the heart, else it is not put away out ofGod's sight, for the heart is open before him.<br>Jer. 4:3,4 An unhumbled heart is like ground untilled. It is groundwhich may be improved; it is our ground let out to us; but it isfallow; it is over-grown with thorns and weeds, the natural product ofthe corrupt heart. Let us entreat the Lord to create in us a cleanheart, and to renew a right spirit within us; for except a man be bornagain, he cannot enter into the kingdom of heaven.<br>Jer. 4:5-18 The fierce conqueror of the neighbouring nations was tomake Judah desolate. The prophet was afflicted to see the people lulledinto security by false prophets. The approach of the enemy isdescribed. Some attention was paid in Jerusalem to outward reformation;but it was necessary that their hearts should be washed, in theexercise of true repentance and faith, from the love and pollution ofsin. When lesser calamities do not rouse sinners and reform nations,sentence will be given against them. The Lord's voice declares thatmisery is approaching, especially against wicked professors of thegospel; when it overtakes them, it will be plainly seen that the fruitof wickedness is bitter, and the end is fatal.<br>Jer. 4:19-31 The prophet had no pleasure in delivering messages ofwrath. He is shown in a vision the whole land in confusion. Comparedwith what it was, every thing is out of order; but the ruin of theJewish nation would not be final. Every end of our comforts is not afull end. Though the Lord may correct his people very severely, yet hewill not cast them off. Ornaments and false colouring would be of noavail. No outward privileges or profession, no contrivances wouldprevent destruction. How wretched the state of those who are likefoolish children in the concerns of their souls! Whatever we areignorant of, may the Lord make of good understanding in the ways ofgodliness. As sin will find out the sinner, so sorrow will, sooner orlater, find out the secure.
Jer 5:	<b>Overview</b><br>The Jews' profession of religion was hypocritical. (Jer. 5:1-9) Thecruel proceedings of their enemies. (Jer. 5:10-18) Their apostacy andidolatry. (Jer. 5:19-31)<br>Jer. 5:1-9 None could be found who behaved as upright and godly men.But the Lord saw the true character of the people through all theirdisguises. The poor were ignorant, and therefore they were wicked. Whatcan be expected but works of darkness, from people that know nothing ofGod and religion? There are God's poor, who, notwithstanding poverty,know the way of the Lord, walk in it, and do their duty; but these werewillingly ignorant, and their ignorance would not be their excuse. Therich were insolent and haughty, and the abuse of God's favours madetheir sin worse.<br>Jer. 5:10-18 Multitudes are ruined by believing that God will not be sostrict as his word says he will; by this artifice Satan undid mankind.Sinners are not willing to own any thing to be God's word, that tendsto part them from, or to disquiet them in, their sins. Mocking andmisusing the Lord's messengers, filled the measure of their iniquity.God can bring trouble upon us from places and causes very remote. Hehas mercy in store for his people, therefore will set bounds to thisdesolating judgment. Let us not overlook the "nevertheless," Jer. 5:18.This is the Lord's covenant with Israel. He thereby proclaims hisholiness, and his utter displeasure against sin while sparing thesinner, Ps. 89:30-35.<br>Jer. 5:19-31 Unhumbled hearts are ready to charge God with being unjustin their afflictions. But they may read their sin in their punishment.If men will inquire wherefore the Lord doeth hard things unto them, letthem think of their sins. The restless waves obeyed the Divine decree,that they should not pass the sandy shores, which were as much arestraint as lofty mountains; but they burst all restraints of God'slaw, and were wholly gone into wickedness. Neither did they considertheir interest. While the Lord, year after year, reserves to us theappointed weeks of harvest, men live on his bounty; yet they transgressagainst him. Sin deprives us of God's blessings; it makes the heaven asbrass, and the earth as iron. Certainly the things of this world arenot the best things; and we are not to think, that, because evil menprosper, God allows their practices. Though sentence against evil worksis not executed speedily, it will be executed. Shall I not visit forthese things? This speaks the certainty and the necessity of God'sjudgments. Let those who walk in bad ways consider that an end willcome, and there will be bitterness in the latter end.
Jer 6:	<b>Overview</b><br>The invasion of Judea. (Jer. 6:1-8) The justice of God's proceedings.(Jer. 6:9-17) All methods used to amend them had been without success.(Jer. 6:18-30)<br>Jer. 6:1-8 Whatever methods are used, it is vain to contend with God'sjudgments. The more we indulge in the pleasures of this life, the morewe unfit ourselves for the troubles of this life. The Chaldean armyshall break in upon the land of Judah, and in a little time devour all.The day is coming, when those careless and secure in sinful ways willbe visited. It is folly to trifle when we have eternal salvation towork out, and the enemies of that salvation to fight against. But theywere thus eager, not that they might fulfil God's counsels, but thatthey might fill their own treasures; yet God thereby served his ownpurposes. The corrupt heart of man, in its natural state, casts outevil thoughts, just as a fountain casts out her waters. It is alwaysflowing, yet always full. The God of mercy is loth to depart even froma provoking people, and is earnest with them, that by repentance andreformation, they may prevent things from coming to extremity.<br>Jer. 6:9-17 When the Lord arises to take vengeance, no sinners of anyage or rank, or of either sex escape. They were set upon the world, andwholly carried away by the love of it. If we judge of this sin by God'sword, we find multitudes in every station and rank given up to it.Those are to be reckoned our worst and most dangerous enemies, whoflatter us in a sinful way. Oh that men would be wise for their souls!Ask for the old paths; the way of godliness and righteousness hasalways been the way God has owned and blessed. Ask for the old pathsset forth by the written word of God. When you have found the good way,go on in it, you will find abundant recompence at your journey's end.But if men will not obey the voice of God and flee to his appointedRefuge, it will plainly appear at the day of judgment, that they areruined because they reject God's word.<br>Jer. 6:18-30 God rejects their outward services, as worthless to atonefor their sins. Sacrifice and incense were to direct them to aMediator; but when offered to purchase a license to go on in sin, theyprovoke God. The sins of God's professing people make them an easy preyto their enemies. They dare not show themselves. Saints may rejoice inhope of God's mercies, though they see them only in the promise:sinners must mourn for fear of God's judgments, though they see themonly in the threatenings. They are the worst of revolters, and are allcorrupters. Sinners soon become tempters. They are compared to oresupposed to have good metal in it, but which proves all dross. Nothingwill prevail to part between them and their sins. Reprobate silvershall they be called, useless and worthless. When warnings,corrections, rebukes, and all means of grace, leave men unrenewed, theywill be left, as rejected of God, to everlasting misery. Let us pray,then, that we may be refined by the Lord, as silver is refined.
Jer 7:	<b>Overview</b><br>Confidence in the temple is vain. (Jer. 7:1-16) The provocation bypersisting in idolatry. (Jer. 7:17-20) God justifies his dealings withthem. (Jer. 7:21-28) And threatens vengeance. (Jer. 7:29-34)<br>Jer. 7:1-16 No observances, professions, or supposed revelations, willprofit, if men do not amend their ways and their doings. None can claiman interest in free salvation, who allow themselves in the practice ofknown sin, or live in the neglect of known duty. They thought that thetemple they profaned would be their protection. But all who continue insin because grace has abounded, or that grace may abound, make Christthe minister of sin; and the cross of Christ, rightly understood, formsthe most effectual remedy to such poisonous sentiments. The Son of Godgave himself for our transgressions, to show the excellence of theDivine law, and the evil of sin. Never let us think we may dowickedness without suffering for it.<br>Jer. 7:17-20 The Jews took pride in showing zeal for their idols. Letus learn to be earnest in the service of our God, even from this badexample. Let us think it an honour to be employed in any work for God.Let us be as diligent ourselves, and as careful to teach our childrenthe truths of God, as many are to teach the mysteries of iniquity. Thedirect tendency of this sin is malice against God, but it will hurtthemselves. And they shall find there is no escaping. God's wrath isfire unquenchable.<br>Jer. 7:21-28 God shows that obedience was required of them. That whichGod commanded was, Hearken diligently to the voice of the Lord thy God.The promise is very encouraging. Let God's will be your rule, and hisfavour shall be your happiness. God was displeased with disobedience.We understand the gospel as little as the Jews understood the law, ifwe think that even the sacrifice of Christ lessens our obligation toobey.<br>Jer. 7:29-34 In token both of sorrow and of slavery, Jerusalem must bedegraded, and separated from God, as she had been separated to him. Theheart is the place in which God has chosen to put his name; but if sinhas the innermost and uppermost place there, we pollute the temple ofthe Lord. The destruction of Jerusalem appears here very terrible. Theslain shall be many; they having made it the place of their sin. Evilpursues sinners, even after death. Those who will not, by the grace ofGod, be cured of vain mirth, shall, by the justice of God, be deprivedof all mirth. How many ruin their health and property withoutcomplaining, when engaged in Satan's service! May we learn to relishholy joys, and to sit loose to all others though lawful.
Jer 8:	<b>Overview</b><br>The remains of the dead exposed. (Jer. 8:1-3) The stupidity of thepeople, compared with the instinct of the brute creation. (Jer. 8:4-13)The alarm of the invasion, and lamentation. (Jer. 8:14-22)<br>Jer. 8:1-3 Though no real hurt can be done to a dead body, yet disgraceto the remains of wicked persons may alarm those yet alive; and thisreminds us that the Divine justice and punishments extend beyond thegrave. Whatever befalls us here, let us humble ourselves before God,and seek his mercy.<br>Jer. 8:4-13 What brought this ruin? 1. The people would not attend toreason; they would not act in the affairs of their souls with commonprudence. Sin is backsliding; it is going back from the way that leadsto life, to that which leads to destruction. 2. They would not attendto the warning of conscience. They did not take the first step towardsrepentance: true repentance begins in serious inquiry as to what wehave done, from conviction that we have done amiss. 3. They would notattend to the ways of providence, nor understand the voice of God inthem, Jer. 8:7. They know not how to improve the seasons of grace,which God affords. Many boast of their religious knowledge, yet, unlesstaught by the Spirit of God, the instinct of brutes is a more sureguide than their supposed wisdom. 4. They would not attend to thewritten word. Many enjoy abundance of the means of grace, have Biblesand ministers, but they have them in vain. They will soon be ashamed oftheir devices. The pretenders to wisdom were the priests and the falseprophets. They flattered people in sin, and so flattered them intodestruction, silencing their fears and complaints with, All is well.Selfish teachers may promise peace when there is no peace; and thus menencourage each other in committing evil; but in the day of visitationthey will have no refuge to flee unto.<br>Jer. 8:14-22 At length they begin to see the hand of God lifted up. Andwhen God appears against us, every thing that is against us appearsformidable. As salvation only can be found in the Lord, so the presentmoment should be seized. Is there no medicine proper for a sick anddying kingdom? Is there no skilful, faithful hand to apply themedicine? Yes, God is able to help and to heal them. If sinners die oftheir wounds, their blood is upon their own heads. The blood of Christis balm in Gilead, his Spirit is the Physician there, all-sufficient;so that the people may be healed, but will not. Thus men die unpardonedand unchanged, for they will not come to Christ to be saved.
Jer 9:	<b>Overview</b><br>The people are corrected, Jerusalem is destroyed. (Jer. 9:1-11) Thecaptives suffer in a foreign land. (Jer. 9:12-22) God'sloving-kindness, He threatens the enemies of his people. (Jer. 9:23-26)<br>Jer. 9:1-11 Jeremiah wept much, yet wished he could weep more, that hemight rouse the people to a due sense of the hand of God. But even thedesert, without communion with God, through Christ Jesus, and theinfluences of the Holy Spirit, must be a place for temptation and evil;while, with these blessings, we may live in holiness in crowded cities.The people accustomed their tongues to lies. So false were they, that abrother could not be trusted. In trading and bargaining they said anything for their own advantage, though they knew it to be false. But Godmarked their sin. Where no knowledge of God is, what good can beexpected? He has many ways of turning a fruitful land into barrennessfor the wickedness of those that dwell therein.<br>Jer. 9:12-22 In Zion the voice of joy and praise used to be heard,while the people kept close to God; but sin has altered the sound, itis now the voice of lamentation. Unhumbled hearts lament theircalamity, but not their sin, which is the cause of it. Let the doors beshut ever so fast, death steals upon us. It enters the palaces ofprinces and great men, though stately, strongly built, and guarded. Norare those more safe that are abroad; death cuts off even the childrenfrom without, and the young men from the streets. Hearken to the wordof the Lord, and mourn with godly sorrow. This alone can bring truecomfort; and it can turn the heaviest afflictions into preciousmercies.<br>Jer. 9:23-26 In this world of sin and sorrow, ending soon in death andjudgement, how foolish for men to glory in their knowledge, health,strength, riches, or in any thing which leaves them under the dominionof sin and the wrath of God! and of which an account must hereafter berendered; it will but increase their misery. Those are the true Israelwho worship God in the Spirit, rejoice in Christ Jesus, and have noconfidence in the flesh. Let us prize the distinction which comes fromGod, and will last for ever. Let us seek it diligently.
Jer 10:	<b>Overview</b><br>The absurdity of idolatry. (Jer. 10:1-16) Destruction denounced againstJerusalem. (Jer. 10:17-25)<br>Jer. 10:1-16 The prophet shows the glory of Israel's God, and exposesthe folly of idolaters. Charms and other attempts to obtainsupernatural help, or to pry into futurity, are copied from the wickedcustoms of the heathen. Let us stand in awe, and not dare provoke God,by giving that glory to another which is due to him alone. He is readyto forgive, and save all who repent and believe in the name of his SonJesus Christ. Faith learns these blessed truths from the word of God;but all knowledge not from that source, leads to doctrines of vanity.<br>Jer. 10:17-25 The Jews who continued in their own land, felt secure.But, sooner or later, sinners will find all things as the word of Godhas declared, and that its threatenings are not empty terrors.Submission will support the believer under every grief allotted to him;but what can render the load of Divine vengeance easy to be borne bythose who fall under it in sullen despair? Those cannot expect toprosper, who do not, by faith and prayer, take God with them in alltheir ways. The report of the enemy's approach was very dreadful. Yetthe designs which men lay deep, and think well formed, are dashed topieces in a moment. Events are often overruled, so as to be quitecontrary to what we intended and expected. If the Lord has directed oursteps into the ways of peace and righteousness, let us entreat him toenable us to walk therein. Say not, Lord, do not correct me; but, Lord,do not correct me in anger. We may bear the smart of God's rod, but wecannot bear the weight of his wrath. Those who restrain prayer, provethat they know not God; for those who know him will seek him, and seekhis favour. If even severe corrections lead sinners to be convinced ofwholesome truths, they will have abundant cause for gratitude. And theywill then humble themselves before the Lord.
Jer 11:	<b>Overview</b><br>The disobedient Jews reproved. (Jer. 11:1-10) Their utter ruin. (Jer.11:11-17) The people would be destroyed who sought the prophet's life.(Jer. 11:18-23)<br>Jer. 11:1-10 God never promised to bestow blessings on his rationalcreatures, while they persist in wilful disobedience. Pardon andacceptance are promised freely to all believers; but no man can besaved who does not obey the command of God to repent, to believe inChrist, to separate from sin and the world, to choose self-denial andnewness of life. In general, men will hearken to those who speak ofdoctrines, promises, and privileges; but when duties are mentioned,they will not bend their ear.<br>Jer. 11:11-17 Evil pursues sinners, and entangles them in snares, outof which they cannot free themselves. Now, in their distress, theirmany gods and many altars stand them in no stead. And those whose ownprayers will not be heard, cannot expect benefit from the prayers ofothers. Their profession of religion shall prove of no use. Whentrouble came upon them, they made this their confidence, but God hasrejected it. His altar shall yield them no satisfaction. Theremembrance of God's former favours to them shall be no comfort undertroubles; and his remembrance of them shall be no argument for theirrelief. Every sin against the Lord is a sin against ourselves, and soit will be found sooner or later.<br>Jer. 11:18-23 The prophet Jeremiah tells much concerning himself, thetimes he lived in being very troublesome. Those of his own city plottedhow they might cause his death. They thought to end his days, but heoutlived most of his enemies; they thought to blast his memory, but itlives to this day, and will be blessed while time lasts. God knows allthe secret designs of his and his people's enemies, and can, when hepleases, make them known. God's justice is a terror to the wicked, buta comfort to the godly. When we are wronged, we have a God to commitour cause to, and it is our duty to commit it to him. We should alsolook well to our own spirits, that we are not overcome with evil, butthat by patient continuance in praying for our enemies, and in kindnessto them, we may overcome evil with good.
Jer 12:	<b>Overview</b><br>Jeremiah complains of the prosperity of the wicked. (Jer. 12:1-6) Theheavy judgments to come upon the nation. (Jer. 12:7-13) Divine mercy tothem, and even to the nations around. (Jer. 12:14-17)<br>Jer. 12:1-6 When we are most in the dark concerning God'sdispensations, we must keep up right thoughts of God, believing that henever did the least wrong to any of his creatures. When we find it hardto understand any of his dealings with us, or others, we must look togeneral truths as our first principles, and abide by them: the Lord isrighteous. The God with whom we have to do, knows how our hearts aretoward him. He knows both the guile of the hypocrite and the sincerityof the upright. Divine judgments would pull the wicked out of theirpasture as sheep for the slaughter. This fruitful land was turned intobarrenness for the wickedness of those that dwelt therein. The Lordreproved the prophet. The opposition of the men of Anathoth was not soformidable as what he must expect from the rulers of Judah. Our griefthat there should be so much evil is often mixed with peevishness onaccount of the trials it occasions us. And in this our favoured day,and under our trifling difficulties, let us consider how we shouldbehave, if called to sufferings like those of saints in former ages.<br>Jer. 12:7-13 God's people had been the dearly-beloved of his soul,precious in his sight, but they acted so, that he gave them up to theirenemies. Many professing churches become like speckled birds,presenting a mixture of religion and the world, with its vain fashions,pursuits, and pollutions. God's people are as men wondered at, as aspeckled bird; but this people had by their own folly made themselvesso; and the beasts and birds are called to prey upon them. The wholeland would be made desolate. But until the judgments were actuallyinflicted, none of the people would lay the warning to heart. WhenGod's hand is lifted up, and men will not see, they shall be made tofeel. Silver and gold shall not profit in the day of the Lord's anger.And the efforts of sinners to escape misery, without repentance andworks answerable thereto, will end in confusion.<br>Jer. 12:14-17 The Lord would plead the cause of his people againsttheir evil neighbours. Yet he would afterwards show mercy to thosenations, when they should learn true religion. This seems to lookforward to the times when the fulness of the Gentiles shall come in.Those who would have their lot with God's people, and a last end liketheirs, must learn their ways, and walk in them.
Jer 13:	<b>Overview</b><br>The glory of the Jews should be marred. (Jer. 13:1-11) All ranks shouldsuffer misery, An earnest exhortation to repentance. (Jer. 13:12-17) Anawful message to Jerusalem and its king. (Jer. 13:18-27)<br>Jer. 13:1-11 It was usual with the prophets to teach by signs. And wehave the explanation, Jer. 13:9-11. The people of Israel had been toGod as this girdle. He caused them to cleave to him by the law he gavethem, the prophets he sent among them, and the favours he showed them.They had by their idolatries and sins buried themselves in foreignearth, mingled among the nations, and were so corrupted that they weregood for nothing. If we are proud of learning, power, and outwardprivileges, it is just with God to wither them. The minds of men shouldbe awakened to a sense of their guilt and danger; yet nothing will beeffectual without the influences of the Spirit.<br>Jer. 13:12-17 As the bottle was fitted to hold the wine, so the sins ofthe people made them vessels of wrath, fitted for the judgments of God;with which they should be filled till they caused each other'sdestruction. The prophet exhorts them to give glory to God, byconfessing their sins, humbling themselves in repentance, and returningto his service. Otherwise they would be carried into other countries inall the darkness of idolatry and wickedness. All misery, witnessed orforeseen, will affect a feeling mind, but the pious heart must mournmost over the afflictions of the Lord's flock.<br>Jer. 13:18-27 Here is a message sent to king Jehoiakim, and his queen.Their sorrows would be great indeed. Do they ask, Wherefore come thesethings upon us? Let them know, it is for their obstinacy in sin. Wecannot alter the natural colour of the skin; and so is it morallyimpossible to reclaim and reform these people. Sin is the blackness ofthe soul; it is the discolouring of it; we were shapen in it, so thatwe cannot get clear of it by any power of our own. But Almighty graceis able to change the Ethiopian's skin. Neither natural depravity, norstrong habits of sin, form an obstacle to the working of God, thenew-creating Spirit. The Lord asks of Jerusalem, whether she isdetermined not be made clean. If any poor slave of sin feels that hecould as soon change his nature as master his headstrong lusts, let himnot despair; for things impossible to men are possible with God. Let usthen seek help from Him who is mighty to save.
Jer 14:	<b>Overview</b><br>A drought upon the land of Judah. (Jer. 14:1-7) A confession of sin inthe name of the people. (Jer. 14:8-9) The Divine purpose to punish isdeclared. (Jer. 14:10-16) The people supplicate. (Jer. 14:17-22)<br>Jer. 14:1-9 The people were in tears. But it was rather the cry oftheir trouble, and of their sin, than of their prayer. Let us bethankful for the mercy of water, that we may not be taught to value itby feeling the want of it. See what dependence husbandmen have upon theDivine providence. They cannot plough nor sow in hope, unless God watertheir furrows. The case even of the wild beasts was very pitiable. Thepeople are not forward to pray, but the prophet prays for them. Sin ishumbly confessed. Our sins not only accuse us, but answer against us.Our best pleas in prayer are those fetched from the glory of God's ownname. We should dread God's departure, more than the removal of ourcreature-comforts. He has given Israel his word to hope in. It becomesus in prayer to show ourselves more concerned for God's glory than forour own comfort. And if we now return to the Lord, he will save us tothe glory of his grace.<br>Jer. 14:10-16 The Lord calls the Jews "this people," not "his people."They had forsaken his service, therefore he would punish them accordingto their sins. He forbade Jeremiah to plead for them. The falseprophets were the most criminal. The Lord pronounces condemnation onthem; but as the people loved to have it so, they were not to escapejudgments. False teachers encourage men to expect peace and salvation,without repentance, faith, conversion, and holiness of life. But thosewho believe a lie must not plead if for an excuse. They shall feel whatthey say they will not fear.<br>Jer. 14:17-22 Jeremiah acknowledged his own sins, and those of thepeople, but pleaded with the Lord to remember his covenant. In theirdistress none of the idols of the Gentiles could help them, nor couldthe heavens give rain of themselves. The Lord will always have a peopleto plead with him at his mercy-seat. He will heal every truly repentingsinner. Should he not see fit to hear our prayers on behalf of ourguilty land, he will certainly bless with salvation all who confesstheir sins and seek his mercy.
Jer 15:	<b>Overview</b><br>The destruction of the wicked described. (Jer. 15:1-9) The prophetlaments such messages, and is reproved. (Jer. 15:10-14) He supplicatespardon, and is promised protection. (Jer. 15:15-21)<br>Jer. 15:1-9 The Lord declares that even Moses and Samuel must havepleaded in vain. The putting of this as a case, though they shouldstand before him, shows that they do not, and that saints in heaven donot pray for saints on earth. The Jews were condemned to differentkinds of misery by the righteous judgment of God, and the remnant wouldbe driven away, like the chaff, into captivity. Then was the populouscity made desolate. Bad examples and misused authority often producefatal effects, even after men are dead, or have repented of theircrimes: this should make all greatly dread being the occasion of sin inothers.<br>Jer. 15:10-14 Jeremiah met with much contempt and reproach, when theyought to have blessed him, and God for him. It is a great andsufficient support to the people of God, that however troublesome theirway may be, it shall be well with them in their latter end. God turnsto the people. Shall the most hardy and vigorous of their efforts beable to contend with the counsel of God, or with the army of theChaldeans? Let them hear their doom. The enemy will treat the prophetwell. But the people who had great estates would be used hardly. Allparts of the country had added to the national guilt; and let each takeshame to itself.<br>Jer. 15:15-21 It is matter of comfort that we have a God, to whoseknowledge of all things we may appeal. Jeremiah pleads with God formercy and relief against his enemies, persecutors, and slanderers. Itwill be a comfort to God's ministers, when men despise them, if theyhave the testimony of their own consciences. But he complains, that hefound little pleasure in his work. Some good people lose much of thepleasantness of religion by the fretfulness and uneasiness of theirnatural temper, which they indulge. The Lord called the prophet tocease from his distrust, and to return to his work. If he attendedthereto, he might be assured the Lord would deliver him from hisenemies. Those who are with God, and faithful to him, he will deliverfrom trouble or carry through it. Many things appear frightful, whichdo not at all hurt a real believer in Christ.
Jer 16:	<b>Overview</b><br>Prohibitions given to the prophet. (Jer. 16:1-9) The justice of God inthese judgments. (Jer. 16:10-13) Future restoration of the Jews, andthe conversion of the Gentiles. (Jer. 16:14-21)<br>Jer. 16:1-9 The prophet must conduct himself as one who expected to seehis country ruined very shortly. In the prospect of sad times, he is toabstain from marriage, mourning for the dead, and pleasure. Those whowould convince others of the truths of God, must make it appear bytheir self-denial, that they believe it themselves. Peace, inward andoutward, family and public, is wholly the work of God, and from hisloving-kindness and mercy. When He takes his peace from any people,distress must follow. There may be times when it is proper to avoidthings otherwise our duty; and we should always sit loose to thepleasures and concerns of this life.<br>Jer. 16:10-13 Here seems to be the language of those who quarrel at theword of God, and instead of humbling and condemning themselves, justifythemselves, as though God did them wrong. A plain and full answer isgiven. They were more obstinate in sin than their fathers, walkingevery one after the devices of his heart. Since they will not hearken,they shall be hurried away into a far country, a land they know not. Ifthey had God's favour, that would make even the land of their captivitypleasant.<br>Jer. 16:14-21 The restoration from the Babylonish captivity would beremembered in place of the deliverance from Egypt; it also typifiedspiritual redemption, and the future deliverance of the church fromantichristian oppression. But none of the sins of sinners can be hiddenfrom God, or shall be overlooked by him. He will find out and raise upinstruments of his wrath, that shall destroy the Jews, by fraud likefishers, by force like hunters. The prophet, rejoicing at the hope ofmercy to come, addressed the Lord as his strength and refuge. Thedeliverance out of captivity shall be a figure of the great salvationto be wrought by the Messiah. The nations have often known the power ofJehovah in his wrath; but they shall know him as the strength of hispeople, and their refuge in time of trouble.
Jer 17:	<b>Overview</b><br>The fatal consequences of the idolatry of the Jews. (Jer. 17:1-4) Thehappiness of the man that trusts in God; the end of the oppositecharacter. (Jer. 17:5-11) The malice of the prophet's enemies. (Jer.17:12-18) The observance of the sabbath. (Jer. 17:19-27)<br>Jer. 17:1-4 The sins which men commit make little impression on theirminds, yet every sin is marked in the book of God; they are all sograven upon the table of the heart, that they will all be remembered bythe conscience. That which is graven in the heart will become plain inthe life; men's actions show the desires and purposes of their hearts.What need we have to humble ourselves before God, who are so vile inhis sight! How should we depend on his mercy and grace, begging of Godto search and prove us; not to suffer us to be deceived by our ownhearts, but to create in us a clean and holy nature by his Spirit!<br>Jer. 17:5-11 He who puts confidence in man, shall be like the heath ina desert, a naked tree, a sorry shrub, the product of barren ground,useless and worthless. Those who trust to their own righteousness andstrength, and think they can do without Christ, make flesh their arm,and their souls cannot prosper in graces or comforts. Those who makeGod their Hope, shall flourish like a tree always green, whose leafdoes not wither. They shall be fixed in peace and satisfaction of mind;they shall not be anxious in a year of drought. Those who make Godtheir Hope, have enough in him to make up the want of allcreature-comforts. They shall not cease from yielding fruit in holinessand good works. The heart, the conscience of man, in his corrupt andfallen state, is deceitful above all things. It calls evil good, andgood evil; and cries peace to those to whom it does not belong. Hereinthe heart is desperately wicked; it is deadly, it is desperate. Thecase is bad indeed, if the conscience, which should set right theerrors of other faculties, is a leader in the delusion. We cannot knowour own hearts, nor what they will do in an hour of temptation. Who canunderstand his errors? Much less can we know the hearts of others, ordepend upon them. He that believes God's testimony in this matter, andlearns to watch his own heart, will find this is a correct, though asad picture, and learns many lessons to direct his conduct. But much inour own hearts and in the hearts of others, will remain unknown. Yetwhatever wickedness there is in the heart, God sees it. Men may beimposed upon, but God cannot be deceived. He that gets riches, and notby right, though he may make them his hope, never shall have joy ofthem. This shows what vexation it is to a worldly man at death, that hemust leave his riches behind; but though the wealth will not follow toanother world, guilt will, and everlasting torment. The rich man takespains to get an estate, and sits brooding upon it, but never has anysatisfaction in it; by sinful courses it comes to nothing. Let us bewise in time; what we get, let us get it honestly; and what we have,use it charitably, that we may be wise for eternity.<br>Jer. 17:12-18 The prophet acknowledges the favour of God in setting upreligion. There is fulness of comfort in God, overflowing, ever-flowingfulness, like a fountain. It is always fresh and clear, likespring-water, while the pleasures of sin are puddle-waters. He prays toGod for healing, saving mercy. He appeals to God concerning hisfaithful discharge of the office to which he was called. He humbly begsthat God would own and protect him in the work to which he had plainlycalled him. Whatever wounds or diseases we find to be in our hearts andconsciences, let us apply to the Lord to heal us, to save us, that oursouls may praise his name. His hands can bind up the troubledconscience, and heal the broken heart; he can cure the worst diseasesof our nature.<br>Jer. 17:19-27 The prophet was to lay before the rulers and the peopleof Judah, the command to keep holy the sabbath day. Let them strictlyobserve the fourth command. If they obeyed this word, their prosperityshould be restored. It is a day of rest, and must not be made a day oflabour, unless in cases of necessity. Take heed, watch against theprofanation of the sabbath. Let not the soul be burdened with the caresof this world on sabbath days. The streams of religion run deep orshallow, according as the banks of the sabbath are kept up orneglected. The degree of strictness with which this ordinance isobserved, or the neglect shown towards it, is a good test to find thestate of spiritual religion in any land. Let all; by their own example,by attention to their families, strive to check this evil, thatnational prosperity may be preserved, and, above all, that souls may besaved.
Jer 18:	<b>Overview</b><br>God's power over his creatures is represented by the potter. (Jer.18:1-10) The Jews exhorted to repentance, and judgments foretold. (Jer.18:11-17) The prophet appeals to God. (Jer. 18:18-23)<br>Jer. 18:1-10 While Jeremiah looks upon the potter's work, God dartsinto his mind two great truths. God has authority, and power, to formand fashion kingdoms and nations as he pleases. He may dispose of us ashe thinks fit; and it would be as absurd for us to dispute this, as forthe clay to quarrel with the potter. But he always goes by fixed rulesof justice and goodness. When God is coming against us in judgments, wemay be sure it is for our sins; but sincere conversion from the evil ofsin will prevent the evil of punishment, as to persons, and tofamilies, and nations.<br>Jer. 18:11-17 Sinners call it liberty to live at large; whereas for aman to be a slave to his lusts, is the very worst slavery. They forsookGod for idols. When men are parched with heat, and meet with cooling,refreshing streams, they use them. In these things men will not leave acertainty for an uncertainty; but Israel left the ancient pathsappointed by the Divine law. They walked not in the highway, in whichthey might travel safely, but in a way in which they must stumble: suchwas the way of idolatry, and such is the way of iniquity. This madetheir land desolate, and themselves miserable. Calamities may be borne,if God smile upon us when under them; but if he is displeased, andrefuses his help, we are undone. Multitudes forget the Lord and hisChrist, and wander from the ancient paths, to walk in ways of their owndevising. But what will they do in the day of judgment!<br>Jer. 18:18-23 When the prophet called to repentance, instead of obeyingthe call, the people devised devices against him. Thus do sinners dealwith the great Intercessor, crucifying him afresh, and speaking againsthim on earth, while his blood is speaking for them in heaven. But theprophet had done his duty to them; and the same will be our rejoicingin a day of evil.
Jer 19:	<b>Overview</b><br>By the type of breaking an earthen vessel, Jeremiah is to predict thedestruction of Judah.<br>Jer. 19:1-9 The prophet must give notice of ruin coming upon Judah andJerusalem. Both rulers and ruled must attend to it. That place whichholiness made the joy of the whole earth, sin made the reproach andshame of the whole earth. There is no fleeing from God's justice, butby fleeing to his mercy.<br>Jer. 19:10-15 The potter's vessel, after it is hardened, can never bepieced again when it is broken. And as the bottle was broken, so shallJudah and Jerusalem be broken by the Chaldeans. No human hand canrepair it; but if they return to the Lord he will heal. As they filledTophet with the slain sacrificed to their idols, so will God fill thewhole city with the slain that shall fall as sacrifices to his justice.Whatever men may think, God will appear as terrible against sin andsinners as the Scriptures state; nor shall the unbelief of men make hispromise or his threatenings of no effect. The obstinacy of sinners insinful ways, is their own fault; if they are deaf to the word of God,it is because they have stopped their ears. We have need to pray thatGod, by his grace, would deliver us from hardness of heart, andcontempt of his word and commandments.
Jer 20:	<b>Overview</b><br>The doom of Pashur, who ill-treated the prophet. (Jer. 20:1-6) Jeremiahcomplains of hard usage. (Jer. 20:7-13) He regrets his ever having beenborn. (Jer. 20:14-18)<br>Jer. 20:1-6 Pashur smote Jeremiah, and put him in the stocks. Jeremiahwas silent till God put a word into his mouth. To confirm this, Pashurhas a name given him, "Fear on every side." It speaks a man not only indistress, but in despair; not only in danger, but in fear on everyside. The wicked are in great fear where no fear is, for God can makethe most daring sinner a terror to himself. And those who will not hearof their faults from God's prophets, shall be made to hear them fromtheir consciences. Miserable is the man thus made a terror to himself.His friends shall fail him. God lets him live miserably, that he may bea monument of Divine justice.<br>Jer. 20:7-13 The prophet complains of the insult and injury heexperienced. But Jer. 20:7 may be read, Thou hast persuaded me, and Iwas persuaded. Thou wast stronger than I; and didst overpower me by theinfluence of thy Spirit upon me. So long as we see ourselves in the wayof God, and of duty, it is weakness and folly, when we meet withdifficulties and discouragements, to wish we had never set out in it.The prophet found the grace of God mighty in him to keep him to hisbusiness, notwithstanding the temptation he was in to throw it up.Whatever injuries are done to us, we must leave them to that God towhom vengeance belongs, and who has said, I will repay. So full was heof the comfort of God's presence, the Divine protection he was under,and the Divine promise he had to depend upon, that he stirred uphimself and others to give God the glory. Let the people of God opentheir cause before Him, and he will enable them to see deliverance.<br>Jer. 20:14-18 When grace has the victory, it is good to be ashamed ofour folly, to admire the goodness of God, and be warned to guard ourspirits another time. See how strong the temptation was, over which theprophet got the victory by Divine assistance! He is angry that hisfirst breath was not his last. While we remember that these wishes arenot recorded for us to utter the like, we may learn good lessons fromthem. See how much those who think they stand, ought to take heed lestthey fall, and to pray daily, Lead us not into temptation. How frail,changeable, and sinful is man! How foolish and unnatural are thethoughts and wishes of our hearts, when we yield to discontent! Let usconsider Him who endured the contradiction of sinners against himself,lest we should be at any time weary and faint in our minds under ourlesser trials.
Jer 21:	<b>Overview</b><br>The only way of deliverance is to be surrendering to the Babylonians.(Jer. 21:1-10) The wickedness of the king and his household. (Jer.21:11-14)<br>Jer. 21:1-10 When the siege had begun, Zedekiah sent to ask of Jeremiahrespecting the event. In times of distress and danger, men often seekthose to counsel and pray for them, whom, at other times, they despiseand oppose; but they only seek deliverance from punishment. Whenprofessors continue in disobedience, presuming upon outward privileges,let them be told that the Lord will prosper his open enemies againstthem. As the king and his princes would not surrender, the people areexhorted to do so. No sinner on earth is left without a Refuge, whoreally desires one; but the way of life is humbling, it requiresself-denial, and exposes to difficulties.<br>Jer. 21:11-14 The wickedness of the king and his family was the worsebecause of their relation to David. They were urged to act withjustice, at once, lest the Lord's anger should be unquenchable. If Godbe for us, who can be against us? But if he be against us, who can doany thing for us?
Jer 22:	<b>Overview</b><br>Justice is recommended, and destruction threatened in case ofdisobedience. (Jer. 22:1-9) The captivity of Jehoiakim, and the end ofJeconiah. (Jer. 22:10-19) The doom of the royal family. (Jer. 22:20-30)<br>Jer. 22:1-9 The king of Judah is spoken to, as sitting upon the throneof David, the man after God's own heart. Let him follow his example,that he may have the benefit of the promises made to him. The way topreserve a government, is to do the duty of it. But sin will be theruin of the houses of princes, as well as of meaner men. And who cancontend with destroyers of God's preparing? God destroys neitherpersons, cities, nor nations, except for sin; even in this world heoften makes it plain for what crimes he sends punishment; and it willbe clear at the day of judgement.<br>Jer. 22:10-19 Here is a sentence of death upon two kings, the wickedsons of a very pious father. Josiah was prevented from seeing the evilto come in this world, and removed to see the good to come in the otherworld; therefore, weep not for him, but for his son Shallum, who islikely to live and die a wretched captive. Dying saints may be justlyenvied, while living sinners are justly pitied. Here also is the doomof Jehoiakim. No doubt it is lawful for princes and great men to build,beautify, and furnish houses; but those who enlarge their houses, andmake them sumptuous, need carefully to watch against the workings ofvain-glory. He built his houses by unrighteousness, with money gottenunjustly. And he defrauded his workmen of their wages. God notices thewrong done by the greatest to poor servants and labourers, and willrepay those in justice, who will not, in justice, pay those whom theyemploy. The greatest of men must look upon the meanest as theirneighbours, and be just to them accordingly. Jehoiakim was unjust, andmade no conscience of shedding innocent blood. Covetousness, which isthe root of all evil, was at the bottom of all. The children whodespise their parents' old fashions, commonly come short of their realexcellences. Jehoiakim knew that his father found the way of duty to bethe way of comfort, yet he would not tread in his steps. He shall dieunlamented, hateful for oppression and cruelty.<br>Jer. 22:20-30 The Jewish state is described under a threefoldcharacter. Very haughty in a day of peace and safety. Very fearful onalarm of trouble. Very much cast down under pressure of trouble. Manynever are ashamed of their sins till brought by them to the lastextremity. The king shall close his days in bondage. Those that thinkthemselves as signets on God's right hand, must not be secure, but fearlest they should be plucked thence. The Jewish king and his familyshall be carried to Babylon. We know where we were born, but where weshall die we know not; it is enough that our God knows. Let it be ourcare that we die in Christ, then it will be well with us wherever wedie, thought it may be in a far country. The Jewish king shall bedespised. Time was when he was delighted in; but all those in whom Godhas no pleasure, some time or other, will be so lowered, that men willhave no pleasure in them. Whoever are childless, it is the Lord thatwrites them so; and those who take no care to do good in their days,cannot expect to prosper. How little is earthly grandeur to be dependedupon, or flourishing families to be rejoiced in! But those who hear thevoice of Christ, and follow him, have eternal life, and shall neverperish, neither shall any enemy pluck them out of his almighty hands.
Jer 23:	<b>Overview</b><br>The restoration of the Jews to their own land. (Jer. 23:1-8) Thewickedness of the priests and prophets of Judah, The people exhortednot to listen to false promises. (Jer. 23:9-22) The pretenders toinspiration threatened. (Jer. 23:23-32) Also the scoffers at trueprophecy. (Jer. 23:33-40)<br>Jer. 23:1-8 Woe be to those who are set to feed God's people, but takeno concern to do them good! Here is a word of comfort to the neglectedsheep. Though only a remnant of God's flock is left, he will find themout, and they shall be brought to their former habitations. Christ isspoken of as a branch from David's family. He is righteous himself, andthrough him all his people are made righteous. Christ shall break theusurped power of Satan. All the spiritual seed of believing Abraham andpraying Jacob shall be protected, and shall be saved from the guilt anddominion of sin. In the days of Christ's government in the soul, thesoul dwells at ease. He is here spoken of as "the Lord ourRighteousness." He is so our Righteousness as no creature could be. Hisobedience unto death is the justifying righteousness of believers, andtheir title to heavenly happiness. And their sanctification, as thesource of all their personal obedience is the effect of their unionwith him, and of the supply of this Spirit. By this name every truebeliever shall call him, and call upon him. We have nothing to pleadbut this, Christ has died, yea, rather is risen again; and we havetaken him for our Lord. This righteousness which he has wrought out tothe satisfaction of law and justice, becomes ours; being a free giftgiven to us, through the Spirit of God, who puts it upon us, clothes uswith it, enables us to lay hold upon it, and claim an interest in it."The Lord our Righteousness" is a sweet name to a convinced sinner; toone that has felt the guilt of sin in his conscience; seen his need ofthat righteousness, and the worth of it. This great salvation is farmore glorious than all former deliverances of his church. May our soulsbe gathered to Him, and be found in him.<br>Jer. 23:9-22 The false prophets of Samaria had deluded the Israelitesinto idolatries; yet the Lord considered the false prophets ofJerusalem as guilty of more horrible wickedness, by which the peoplewere made bold in sin. These false teachers would be compelled tosuffer the most bitter part of the Lord's indignation. They madethemselves believe that there was no harm in sin, and practisedaccordingly; then they made others believe so. Those who are resolvedto go on in evil ways, will justly be given up to believe strongdelusions. But which of them had received any revelation of God, orunderstood any thing of his word? There was a time coming when theywould reflect on their folly and unbelief with remorse. The teachingand example of the true prophets led men to repentance, faith, andrighteousness. The false prophets led men to rest in forms and notions,and to be quiet in their sins. Let us take heed that we do not followunrighteousness.<br>Jer. 23:23-32 Men cannot be hidden from God's all-seeing eye. Will theynever see what judgments they prepare for themselves? Let them considerwhat a vast difference there is between these prophecies and thosedelivered by the true prophets of the Lord. Let them not call theirfoolish dreams Divine oracles. The promises of peace these prophetsmake are no more to be compared to God's promises than chaff to wheat.The unhumbled heart of man is like a rock; if not melted by the word ofGod as a fire, it will be broken to pieces by it as a hammer. How canthey be long safe, or at all easy, who have a God of almighty poweragainst them? The word of God is no smooth, lulling, deceitful message.And by its faithfulness it may certainly be distinguished from falsedoctrines.<br>Jer. 23:33-40 Those are miserable indeed who are forsaken and forgottenof God; and men's jesting at God's judgments will not baffle them. Godhad taken Israel to be a people near to him, but they shall now be castout of his presence. It is a mark of great and daring impiety for mento jest with the words of God. Every idle and profane word will add tothe sinner's burden in the day of judgment, when everlasting shame willbe his portion.
Jer 24:	<b>Overview</b><br>Good and bad figs represent the Jews in captivity, and those who remainin their own land.<br>The prophet saw two baskets of figs set before the temple, as offeringsof first-fruits. The figs in one basket were very good, those in theother basket very bad. What creature viler than a wicked man? and whatmore valuable than a godly man? This vision was to raise the spirits ofthose gone into captivity, by assuring them of a happy return; and tohumble and awaken the proud and secure spirits of those yet inJerusalem, by assuring them of a miserable captivity. The good figsrepresents the pious captives. We cannot determine as to God's love orhatred by what is before us. Early suffering sometimes proves for thebest. The sooner the child is corrected, the better effect thecorrection is likely to have. Even this captivity was for their good;and God's intentions never are in vain. By afflictions they wereconvinced of sin, humbled under the hand of God, weaned from the world,taught to pray, and turned from sins, particularly from idolatry. Godpromises that he will own them in captivity. The Lord will own thosewho are his, in all conditions. God assures them of his protection introuble, and a glorious deliverance in due time. When our troubles aresanctified to us, we may be sure that they will end well. They shallreturn to him with their whole heart. Thus they should have liberty toown him for their God, to pray to him, and expect blessings from him.The bad figs were Zedekiah and those of his party yet in the land.These should be removed for their hurt, and forsaken of all mankind.God has many judgments, and those that escape one, may expect another,till they are brought to repent. Doubtless, this prophecy had itsfulfilment in that age; but the Spirit of prophecy may here lookforward to the dispersion of the unbelieving Jews, in all the nationsof the earth. Let those who desire blessings from the Lord, beg that hewill give them a heart to know him.
Jer 25:	<b>Overview</b><br>The Jews rebuked for not obeying calls to repentance. (Jer. 25:1-7)Their captivity during seventy years is expressly foretold. (Jer.25:8-14) Desolations upon the nations shown by the emblem of a cup ofwrath. (Jer. 25:15-29) The judgments again declared. (Jer. 25:30-38)<br>Jer. 25:1-7 The call to turn from evil ways to the worship and serviceof God, and for sinners to trust in Christ, and partake of hissalvation, concerns all men. God keeps an account how long we possessthe means of grace; and the longer we have them, the heavier will ouraccount be if we have not improved them. Rising early, points out theearnest desire that this people should turn and live. Personal andparticular reformation must be insisted on as necessary to a nationaldeliverance; and every one must turn from his own evil way. Yet all wasto no purpose. They would not take the right and only method to turnaway the wrath of God.<br>Jer. 25:8-14 The fixing of the time during which the Jewish captivityshould last, would not only confirm the prophecy, but also comfort thepeople of God, and encourage faith and prayer. The ruin of Babylon isforetold: the rod will be thrown into the fire when the correcting workis done. When the set time to favour Zion is come, Babylon shall bepunished for their iniquity, as other nations have been punished fortheir sins. Every threatening of the Scripture will certainly beaccomplished.<br>Jer. 25:15-29 The evil and the good events of life are oftenrepresented in Scripture as cups. Under this figure is represented thedesolation then coming upon that part of the world, of whichNebuchadnezzar, who had just began to reign and act, was to be theinstrument; but this destroying sword would come from the hand of God.The desolations the sword should make in all these kingdoms, arerepresented by the consequences of excessive drinking. This may make usloathe the sin of drunkenness, that the consequences of it are used toset forth such a woful condition. Drunkenness deprives men of the useof their reason, makes men as mad. It takes from them the valuableblessing, health; and is a sin which is its own punishment. This mayalso make us dread the judgments of war. It soon fills a nation withconfusion. They will refuse to take the cup at thy hand. They will notbelieve Jeremiah; but he must tell them it is the word of the Lord ofhosts, and it is in vain for them to struggle against Almighty power.And if God's judgments begin with backsliding professors, let not thewicked expect to escape.<br>Jer. 25:30-38 The Lord has just ground of controversy with every nationand every person; and he will execute judgment on all the wicked. Whocan avoid trembling when God speaks in displeasure? The days are fullycome; the time fixed in the Divine counsels, which will make thenations wholly desolate. The tender and delicate shall share the commoncalamity. Even those who used to live in peace, and did nothing toprovoke, shall not escape. Blessed be God, there is a peaceablehabitation above, for all the sons of peace. The Lord will preserve hischurch and all believers in all changes; for nothing can separate themfrom his love.
Jer 26:	<b>Overview</b><br>The destruction of the temple and city foretold. (Jer. 26:1-6)Jeremiah's life is threatened. (Jer. 26:7-15) He is defended by theelders. (Jer. 26:16-24)<br>Jer. 26:1-6 God's ambassadors must not seek to please men, or to savethemselves from harm. See how God waits to be gracious. If theypersisted in disobedience, it would ruin their city and temple. Can anything else be expected? Those who will not be subject to the commandsof God, make themselves subject to the curse of God.<br>Jer. 26:7-15 The priests and prophets charged Jeremiah as deservingdeath, and bore false witness against him. The elders of Israel came toinquire into this matter. Jeremiah declares that the Lord sent him toprophesy thus. As long as ministers keep close to the word they havefrom God, they need not fear. And those are very unjust who complain ofministers for preaching of hell and damnation; for it is from a desireto bring them to heaven and salvation. Jeremiah warns them of theirdanger if they go on against him. All men may know, that to hurt, orput to death, or to show hatred to their faithful reprovers, willhasten and increase their own punishment.<br>Jer. 26:16-24 When secure sinners are threatened with taking away theSpirit of God, and the kingdom of God, it is what is warranted from theword of God. Hezekiah who protected Micah, prospered. Did Jehoiakim,who slew Urijah, prosper? The examples of bad men, and the badconsequences of their sins, should deter from what is evil. Urijah wasfaithful in delivering his message, but faulty in leaving his work. Andthe Lord was pleased to permit him to lose his life, while Jeremiah wasprotected in danger. Those are safest who most simply trust in theLord, whatever their outward circumstances may be; and that He has allmen's hearts in his hands, encourages us to trust him in the way ofduty. He will honour and recompense those who show kindness to such asare persecuted for his sake.
Jer 27:	<b>Overview</b><br>The neighbouring nations to be subdued. (Jer. 27:1-11) Zedekiah iswarned to yield. (Jer. 27:12-18) The vessels of the temple to becarried to Babylon, but afterwards to be restored. (Jer. 27:19-22)<br>Jer. 27:1-11 Jeremiah is to prepare a sign that all the neighbouringcountries would be made subject to the king of Babylon. God asserts hisright to dispose of kingdoms as he pleases. Whatever any have of thegood things of this world, it is what God sees fit to give; we shouldtherefore be content. The things of this world are not the best things,for the Lord often gives the largest share to bad men. Dominion is notfounded in grace. Those who will not serve the God who made them, shalljustly be made to serve their enemies that seek to ruin them. Jeremiahurges them to prevent their destruction, by submission. A meek spirit,by quiet submission to the hardest turns of providence, makes the bestof what is bad. Many persons may escape destroying providences, bysubmitting to humbling providences. It is better to take up a lightcross in our way, than to pull a heavier on our own heads. The poor inspirit, the meek and humble, enjoy comfort, and avoid many miseries towhich the high-spirited are exposed. It must, in all cases, be ourinterest to obey God's will.<br>Jer. 27:12-18 Jeremiah persuades the king of Judah to surrender to theking of Babylon. Is it their wisdom to submit to the heavy iron yoke ofa cruel tyrant, that they may secure their lives; and is it not muchmore our wisdom to submit to the pleasant and easy yoke of our Lord andMaster, Jesus Christ, that we may secure our souls? It were well ifsinners would be afraid of the destruction threatened against all whowill not have Christ to reign over them. Why should they die the seconddeath, infinitely worse than that by sword and famine, when they maysubmit and live? And those who encourage sinners to go on in sinfulways, will perish with them.<br>Jer. 27:19-22 Jeremiah assures them that the brazen vessels should goafter the golden ones. All shall be carried to Babylon. But heconcludes with a gracious promise, that the time would come when theyshould be brought back. Though the return of the prosperity of thechurch does not come in our time, we must not despair, for it will comein God's time.
Jer 28:	<b>Overview</b><br>A false prophet opposes Jeremiah. (Jer. 28:1-9) The false prophetwarned of his approaching death. (Jer. 28:10-17)<br>Jer. 28:1-9 Hananiah spoke a false prophecy. Here is not a word of goodcounsel urging the Jews to repent and return to God. He promisestemporal mercies, in God's name, but makes no mention of the spiritualmercies which God always promised with earthly blessings. This was notthe first time Jeremiah had prayed for the people, though he prophesiedagainst them. He appeals to the event, to prove Hananiah's falsehood.The prophet who spake only of peace and prosperity, without adding thatthey must not by wilful sin stop God's favours, will be proved a falseprophet. Those who do not declare the alarming as well as theencouraging parts of God's word, and call men to repentance, and faith,and holiness, tread in the steps of the false prophets. The gospel ofChrist encourages men to do works meet for repentance, but gives noencouragement to continue in sin.<br>Jer. 28:10-17 Hananiah is sentenced to die, and Jeremiah, when he hasreceived direction from God, boldly tells him so; but not before hereceived that commission. Those have much to answer for, who tellsinners that they shall have peace, though they harden their hearts incontempt of God's word. The servant of God must be gentle to all men.He must give up even his right, and leave the Lord to plead his cause.Every attempt of ungodly men to make vain the purposes of God, will addto their miseries.
Jer 29:	<b>Overview</b><br>Two letters to the captives in Babylon; In the first, they arerecommended to be patient and composed. (Jer. 29:1-19) In the second,judgments are denounced against the false prophets who deceived them.(Jer. 29:20-32)<br>Jer. 29:1-7 The written word of God is as truly given by inspiration ofGod as his spoken word. The zealous servant of the Lord will use everymeans to profit those who are far off, as well as those who are nearhim. The art of writing is very profitable for this end; and by the artof printing it is rendered most beneficial for circulating theknowledge of the word of God. God's sending to the captives by thisletter would show that he had not forsaken them, though he wasdispleased, and corrected them. If they live in the fear of God, theymay live comfortably in Babylon. In all conditions of life, it is ourwisdom and duty not to throw away the comfort of what we may have,because we have not all we would have. They are directed to seek thegood of the country where they were captives. While the king of Babylonprotected them, they must live quiet and peaceable lives under him, inall godliness and honesty; patiently leaving it to God to workdeliverance for them in due time.<br>Jer. 29:8-19 Let men beware how they call those prophets whom theychoose after their own fancies, and how they consider their fancies anddreams to be revelations from God. False prophets flatter people intheir sins, because they love to be flattered; and they speak smoothlyto their prophets, that their prophets may speak smoothly to them. Godpromises that they should return after seventy years were accomplished.By this it appears, that the seventy years of the captivity are not tobe reckoned from the last captivity, but the first. It will be thebringing to pass of God's good word to them. This shall form God'spurposes. We often do not know our own minds, but the Lord is never atan uncertainty. We are sometimes ready to fear that God's designs areall against us; but as to his own people, even that which seems evil,is for good. He will give them, not the expectations of their fears, orthe expectations of their fancies, but the expectations of their faith;the end he has promised, which will be the best for them. When the Lordpours out an especial spirit of prayer, it is a good sign that he iscoming toward us in mercy. Promises are given to quicken and encourageprayer. He never said, Seek ye me in vain. Those who remained atJerusalem would be utterly destroyed, notwithstanding what the falseprophets said to the contrary. The reason has often been given, and itjustifies the eternal ruin of impenitent sinners; Because they have nothearkened to my words; I called, but they refused.<br>Jer. 29:20-32 Jeremiah foretells judgments upon the false prophets, whodeceived the Jews in Babylon. Lying was bad; lying to the people of theLord, to delude them into a false hope, was worse; but pretending torest their own lies upon the God of truth, was worst of all. Theyflattered others in their sins, because they could not reprove themwithout condemning themselves. The most secret sins are known to God;and there is a day coming when he will bring to light all the hiddenworks of darkness. Shemaiah urges the priests to persecute Jeremiah.Their hearts are wretchedly hardened who justify doing mischief byhaving power to do it. They were in a miserable thraldom for mockingthe messengers of the Lord, and misusing his prophets; yet in theirdistress they trespass still more against the Lord. Afflictions willnot of themselves cure men of their sins, unless the grace of God workswith them. Those who slight the blessings, deserve to lose the benefitof God's word, like Shemaiah. The accusations against many activeChristians in all ages, amount to no more than this, that theyearnestly counsel men to attend to their true interest and duties, andto wait for the performance of God's promises in his appointed way.
Jer 30:	<b>Overview</b><br>Troubles which shall be before the restoration of Israel. (Jer.30:1-11) Encouragement to trust Divine promises. (Jer. 30:12-17) Theblessings under Christ, and the wrath on the wicked. (Jer. 30:18-24)<br>Jer. 30:1-11 Jeremiah is to write what God had spoken to him. The verywords are such as the Holy Ghost teaches. These are the words Godordered to be written; and promises written by his order, are truly hisword. He must write a description of the trouble the people were nowin, and were likely to be in. A happy end should be put to thesecalamities. Though the afflictions of the church may last long, theyshall not last always. The Jews shall be restored again. They shallobey, or hearken to the Messiah, the Christ, the Son of David, theirKing. The deliverance of the Jews from Babylon, is pointed out in theprophecy, but the restoration and happy state of Israel and Judah, whenconverted to Christ their King, are foretold; also the miseries of thenations before the coming of Christ. All men must honour the Son asthey honour the Father, and come into the service and worship of God byhim. Our gracious Lord pardons the sins of the believer, and breaks offthe yoke of sin and Satan, that he may serve God without fear, inrighteousness and true holiness before him all the remainder of hisdays, as the redeemed subject of Christ our King.<br>Jer. 30:12-17 When God is against a people, who will be for them? Whocan be for them, so as to do them any kindness? Incurable griefs areowing to incurable lusts. Yet, though the captives suffered justly, andcould not help themselves, the Lord intended to appear for them, and topunish their oppressors; and he will still do so. But every effort toheal ourselves must prove fruitless, so long as we neglect the heavenlyAdvocate and sanctifying Spirit. The dealings of His grace with everytrue convert, and every returning backslider, are the same in effect ashis proceedings to the Jews.<br>Jer. 30:18-24 We have here further intimations of the favour of God forthem after the days of their calamity have expired. The proper work andoffice of Christ, as Mediator, is to draw near unto God, for us, as theHigh Priest of our profession. His own undertaking, in compliance withhis Father's will, and in compassion to fallen man, engaged him. JesusChrist was, in all this, truly wonderful. They shall be taken againinto covenant with the Lord, according to the covenant made with theirfathers. "I will be your God:" it is his good-will to us, which is thesummary of that part of the covenant. The wrath of God against thewicked is very terrible, like a whirlwind. The purposes of his wrath,as well as the purposes of his love, will all be fulfilled. God willcomfort all that turn to him; but those who approach him must havetheir hearts engaged to do it with reverence, devotion, and faith. Howwill they escape who neglect so great salvation?
Jer 31:	<b>Overview</b><br>The restoration of Israel. (Jer. 31:1-9) Promises of guidance andhappiness; Rachel lamenting. (Jer. 31:10-17) Ephraim laments hiserrors. (Jer. 31:18-20) The promised Saviour. (Jer. 31:21-26) God'scare over the church. (Jer. 31:27-34) Peace and prosperity in gospeltime. (Jer. 31:35-40)<br>Jer. 31:1-9 God assures his people that he will again take them intocovenant relation to himself. When brought very low, and difficultiesappear, it is good to remember that it has been so with the churchformerly. But it is hard under present frowns to take comfort fromformer smiles; yet it is the happiness of those who, through grace, areinterested in the love of God, that it is an everlasting love, fromeverlasting in the counsels, to everlasting in the continuance. Thosewhom God loves with this love, he will draw to himself, by theinfluences of his Spirit upon their souls. When praising God for whathe has done, we must call upon him for the favours his church needs andexpects. When the Lord calls, we must not plead that we cannot come;for he that calls us, will help us, will strengthen us. The goodness ofGod shall lead them to repentance. And they shall weep for sin withmore bitterness, and more tenderness, when delivered out of theircaptivity, than when groaning under it. If we take God for our Father,and join the church of the first-born, we shall want nothing that isgood for us. These predictions doubtless refer also to a futuregathering of the Israelites from all quarters of the globe. And theyfiguratively describe the conversion of sinners to Christ, and theplain and safe way in which they are led.<br>Jer. 31:10-17 He that scattered Israel, knows where to find them. It iscomfortable to observe the goodness of the Lord in the gifts ofprovidence. But our souls are never valuable as gardens, unless wateredwith the dews of God's Spirit and grace. A precious promise follows,which will not have full accomplishment except in the heavenly Zion.Let them be satisfied of God's loving-kindness, and they will besatisfied with it, and desire no more to make them happy. Rachel isrepresented as rising from her grave, and refusing to be comforted,supposing her offspring rooted out. The murder of the children atBethlehem, by Herod, Matt. 2:16-18, in some degree fulfilled thisprediction, but could not be its full meaning. If we have hope in theend, concerning an eternal inheritance, for ourselves and thosebelonging to us, all temporal afflictions may be borne, and will be forour good.<br>Jer. 31:18-20 Ephraim (the ten tribes) is weeping for sin. He is angryat himself for his sin, and folly, and frowardness. He finds he cannot,by his own power, keep himself close with God, much less bring himselfback when he is revolted. Therefore he prays, Turn thou me, and I shallbe turned. His will was bowed to the will of God. When the teaching ofGod's Spirit went with the corrections of his providence, then the workwas done. This is our comfort in affliction, that the Lord thinks uponus. God has mercy in store, rich mercy, sure mercy, suitable mercy, forall who seek him in sincerity.<br>Jer. 31:21-26 The way from the bondage of sin to the liberty of God'schildren, is a high-way. It is plain, it is safe; yet none are likelyto walk in it, unless they set their hearts towards it. They areencouraged by the promise of a new, unheard-of, extraordinary thing; acreation, a work of Almighty power; the human nature of Christ, formedand prepared by the power of the Holy Ghost: and this is here mentionedas an encouragement to the Jews to return to their own land. And acomfortable prospect is given them of a happy settlement there.Godliness and honesty God has joined: let no man think to put themasunder, or to make the one atone for the want of the other. In thelove and favour of God the weary soul shall find rest, and thesorrowful shall find joy. And what can we see with more satisfactionthan the good of Jerusalem, and peace upon Israel?<br>Jer. 31:27-34 The people of God shall become numerous and prosperous.In Heb. 8:8,9, this place is quoted as the sum of the covenant of gracemade with believers in Jesus Christ. Not, I will give them a new law;for Christ came not to destroy the law, but to fulfil it; but the lawshall be written in their hearts by the finger of the Spirit, asformerly written in the tables of stone. The Lord will, by his grace,make his people willing people in the day of his power. All shall knowthe Lord; all shall be welcome to the knowledge of God, and shall havethe means of that knowledge. There shall be an outpouring of the HolySpirit, at the time the gospel is published. No man shall finallyperish, but for his own sins; none, who is willing to accept ofChrist's salvation.<br>Jer. 31:35-40 As surely as the heavenly bodies will continue theirsettled course, according to the will of their Creator, to the end oftime, and as the raging sea obeys him, so surely will the Jews becontinued a separate people. Words can scarcely set forth more stronglythe restoration of Israel. The rebuilding of Jerusalem, and itsenlargement and establishment, shall be an earnest of the great thingsGod will do for the gospel church. The personal happiness of every truebeliever, as well as the future restoration of Israel, is secured bypromise, covenant, and oath. This Divine love passes knowledge; and tothose who take hold upon it, every present mercy is an earnest ofsalvation.
Jer 32:	<b>Overview</b><br>Jeremiah buys a field. (Jer. 32:1-15) The prophet's prayer. (Jer.32:16-25) God declares that he will give up his people, but promises torestore them. (Jer. 32:26-44)<br>Jer. 32:1-15 Jeremiah, being in prison for his prophecy, purchased apiece of ground. This was to signify, that though Jerusalem wasbesieged, and the whole country likely to be laid waste, yet the timewould come, when houses, and fields, and vineyards, should be againpossessed. It concerns ministers to make it appear that they believewhat they preach to others. And it is good to manage even our worldlyaffairs in faith; to do common business with reference to theprovidence and promise of God.<br>Jer. 32:16-25 Jeremiah adores the Lord and his infinite perfections.When at any time we are perplexed about the methods of Providence, itis good for us to look to first principles. Let us consider that God isthe fountain of all being, power, and life; that with him no difficultyis such as cannot be overcome; that he is a God of boundless mercy;that he is a God of strict justice; and that he directs every thing forthe best. Jeremiah owns that God was righteous in causing evil to comeupon them. Whatever trouble we are in, personal or public, we maycomfort ourselves that the Lord sees it, and knows how to remedy it. Wemust not dispute God's will, but we may seek to know what it means.<br>Jer. 32:26-44 God's answer discovers the purposes of his wrath againstthat generation of the Jews, and the purposes of his grace concerningfuture generations. It is sin, and nothing else, that ruins them. Therestoration of Judah and Jerusalem is promised. This people were now atlength brought to despair. But God gives hope of mercy which he had instore for them hereafter. Doubtless the promises are sure to allbelievers. God will own them for his, and he will prove himself theirs.He will give them a heart to fear him. All true Christians shall have adisposition to mutual love. Though they may have different views aboutlesser things, they shall all be one in the great things of God; intheir views of the evil of sin, and the low estate of fallen man, theway of salvation through the Saviour, the nature of true holiness, thevanity of the world, and the importance of eternal things. Whom Godloves, he loves to the end. We have no reason to distrust God'sfaithfulness and constancy, but only our own hearts. He will settlethem again in Canaan. These promises shall surely be performed.Jeremiah's purchase was the pledge of many a purchase that should bemade after the captivity; and those inheritances are but faintresemblances of the possessions in the heavenly Canaan, which are keptfor all who have God's fear in their hearts, and do not depart fromhim. Let us then bear up under our trials, assured we shall obtain allthe good he has promised us.
Jer 33:	<b>Overview</b><br>The restoration of the Jews. (Jer. 33:1-13) The Messiah promised;happiness of his times. (Jer. 33:14-26)<br>Jer. 33:1-13 Those who expect to receive comforts from God, must callupon him. Promises are given, not to do away, but to quicken andencourage prayer. These promises lead us to the gospel of Christ; andin that God has revealed truth to direct us, and peace to make us easy.All who by sanctifying grace are cleansed from the filth of sin, bypardoning mercy are freed from the guilt. When sinners are thusjustified, washed, and sanctified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and bythe Holy Spirit, they are enabled to walk before God in peace andpurity. Many are led to perceive the real difference between the peopleof God and the world around them, and to fear the Divine wrath. It ispromised that the people who were long in sorrow, shall again be filledwith joy. Where the Lord gives righteousness and peace, he will giveall needful supplies for temporal wants; and all we have will becomforts, as sanctified by the word and by prayer.<br>Jer. 33:14-26 To crown the blessings God has in store, here is apromise of the Messiah. He imparts righteousness to his church, for heis made of God to us righteousness; and believers are made therighteousness of God in him. Christ is our Lord God, our righteousness,our sanctification, and our redemption. His kingdom is an everlastingkingdom. But in this world prosperity and adversity succeed each other,as light and darkness, day and night. The covenant of priesthood shallbe secured. And all true believers are a holy priesthood, a royalpriesthood, they offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God;themselves, in the first place, as living sacrifices. The promises ofthat covenant shall have full accomplishment in the gospel Israel. InGal. 6:16, all that walk according to the gospel rule, are made to bethe Israel of God, on whom shall be peace and mercy. Let us not despisethe families which were of old the chosen people of God, though for atime they seem to be cast off.
Jer 34:	<b>Overview</b><br>Zedekiah's death at Babylon foretold. (Jer. 34:1-7) The Jews reprovedfor compelling their poor brethren to return to unlawful bondage. (Jer.34:8-22)<br>Jer. 34:1-7 Zedekiah is told that the city shall be taken, and that heshall die a captive, but he shall die a natural death. It is better tolive and die penitent in a prison, than to live and die impenitent in apalace.<br>Jer. 34:8-22 A Jew should not be held in servitude above seven years.This law they and their fathers had broken. And when there was somehope that the siege was raised, they forced the servants they hadreleased into their services again. Those who think to cheat God bydissembled repentance and partial reformation, put the greatest cheatupon their own souls. This shows that liberty to sin, is really onlyliberty to have the sorest judgments. It is just with God to disappointexpectations of mercy, when we disappoint the expectations of duty. Andwhen reformation springs only from terror, it is seldom lasting. Solemnvows thus entered into, profane the ordinances of God; and the mostforward to bind themselves by appeals to God, are commonly most readyto break them. Let us look to our hearts, that our repentance may bereal, and take care that the law of God regulates our conduct.
Jer 35:	<b>Overview</b><br>The obedience of the Rechabites. (Jer. 35:1-11) The Jews' disobedienceto the Lord. (Jer. 35:12-19)<br>Jer. 35:1-11 Jonadab was famous for wisdom and piety. He lived nearly300 years before, II Kin. 10:15. Jonadab charged his posterity not todrink wine. He also appointed them to dwell in tents, or movabledwelling: this would teach them not to think of settling any where inthis world. To keep low, would be the way to continue long in the landwhere they were strangers. Humility and contentment are always the bestpolicy, and men's surest protection. Also, that they might not run intounlawful pleasures, they were to deny themselves even lawful delights.The consideration that we are strangers and pilgrims should oblige usto abstain from all fleshly lusts. Let them have little to lose, andthen losing times would be the less dreadful: let them sit loose towhat they had, and then they might with less pain be stript of it.Those are in the best frame to meet sufferings who live a life ofself-denial, and who despise the vanities of the world. Jonadab'sposterity observed these rules strictly, only using proper means fortheir safety in a time of general suffering.<br>Jer. 35:12-19 The trial of the Rechabites' constancy was for a sign; itmade the disobedience of the Jews to God the more marked. TheRechabites were obedient to one who was but a man like themselves, andJonadab never did for his seed what God has done for his people. Mercyis promised to the Rechabites. We are not told respecting theperformance of this promise; but doubtless it was performed, andtravellers say the Rechabites may be found a separate people to thisday. Let us follow the counsels of our pious forefathers, and we shallfind good in so doing.
Jer 36:	<b>Overview</b><br>Baruch is to write the prophecies of Jeremiah. (Jer. 36:1-8) Theprinces advise them to hide themselves. (Jer. 36:9-19) The king havingheard a part, burns the roll. (Jer. 36:20-32)<br>Jer. 36:1-8 The writing of the Scriptures was by Divine appointment.The Divine wisdom directed to this as a proper means; if it failed, thehouse of Judah would be the more without excuse. The Lord declares tosinners the evil he purposes to do against them, that they may hear,and fear, and return from their evil ways; and whenever any one makesthis use of God's warnings, in dependence on his promised mercy, hewill find the Lord ready to forgive his sins. All others will be leftwithout excuse; and the consideration that great is the anger God haspronounced against us for sin, should quicken both our prayers and ourendeavours.<br>Jer. 36:9-19 Shows of piety and devotion may be found even among those,who, though they keep up forms of godliness, are strangers and enemiesto the power of it. The princes patiently attended the reading of thewhole book. They were in great fear. But even those who are convincedto the truth and importance of what they hear, and are disposed tofavour those who preach it, often have difficulties and reserves abouttheir safety, interest, or preferment, so that they do not actaccording to their convictions, and try to get rid of what they findtroublesome.<br>Jer. 36:20-32 Those who despise the word of God, will soon show, asthis king did, that they hate it; and, like him, they would wish itdestroyed. See what enmity there is against God in the carnal mind, andwonder at his patience. The princes showed some concern, till they sawhow light the king made of it. Beware of making light of God's word!
Jer 37:	<b>Overview</b><br>The Chaldean army will return. (Jer. 37:1-10) Jeremiah is imprisoned.(Jer. 37:11-21)<br>Jer. 37:1-10 Numbers witness the fatal effects of other men's sins, yetheedlessly step into their places, and follow the same destructivecourse. When in distress, we ought to desire the prayers of ministersand Christian friends. And it is common for those to desire to beprayed for, who will not be advised; yet sinners are often hardened bya pause in judgments. But if God help us not, no creature can. Whateverinstruments God has determined to use, they shall do the work, thoughthey seem unlikely.<br>Jer. 37:11-21 There are times when it is the wisdom of good men toretire, to enter into their chambers, and to shut the doors, Is. 26:20.Jeremiah was seized as a deserter, and committed to prison. But it isno new thing for the best friends of the church to be belied, as in theinterests of her worst enemies. When thus falsely accused, we may denythe charge, and commit our cause to Him who judges righteously.Jeremiah obtained mercy of the Lord to be faithful, and would not, toobtain mercy of man, be unfaithful to God or to his prince; he tellsthe king the whole truth. When Jeremiah delivered God's message, hespake with boldness; but when he made his own request, he spakesubmissively. A lion in God's cause must be a lamb in his own. And Godgave Jeremiah favour in the eyes of the king. The Lord God can makeeven the cells of a prison become pastures to his people, and willraise up friends to provide for them, so that in the days of faminethey shall be satisfied.
Jer 38:	<b>Overview</b><br>Jeremiah is cast into a dungeon, from whence he is delivered by anEthiopian. (Jer. 38:1-13) He advises the king to surrender to theChaldeans. (Jer. 38:14-28)<br>Jer. 38:1-13 Jeremiah went on in his plain preaching. The princes wenton in their malice. It is common for wicked people to look upon God'sfaithful ministers as enemies, because they show what enemies thewicked are to themselves while impenitent. Jeremiah was put into adungeon. Many of God's faithful witnesses have been privately made awayin prisons. Ebed-melech was an Ethiopian; yet he spoke to the kingfaithfully, These men have done ill in all they have done to Jeremiah.See how God can raise up friends for his people in distress. Orderswere given for the prophet's release, and Ebed-melech saw him drawn up.Let this encourage us to appear boldly for God. Special notice is takenof his tenderness for Jeremiah. What do we behold in the differentcharacters then, but the same we behold in the different charactersnow, that the Lord's children are conformed to his example, and thechildren of Satan to their master?<br>Jer. 38:14-28 Jeremiah was not forward to repeat the warnings, whichseemed only to endanger his own life, and to add to the king's guilt,but asked whether he feared to do the will of God. The less men fearGod, the more they fear men; often they dare not act according to theirown judgments and consciences.
Jer 39:	<b>Overview</b><br>The taking of Jerusalem. (Jer. 39:1-10) Jeremiah used well. (Jer.39:11-14) Promises of safety to Ebed-melech. (Jer. 39:15-18)<br>Jer. 39:1-10 Jerusalem was so strong, that the inhabitants believed theenemy could never enter it. But sin provoked God to withdraw hisprotection, and then it was as weak as other cities. Zedekiah had hiseyes put out; so he was condemned to darkness who had shut his eyesagainst the clear light of God's word. Those who will not believe God'swords, will be convinced by the event. Observe the wonderful changes ofProvidence, how uncertain are earthly possessions; and see the justdealings of Providence: but whether the Lord makes men poor or rich,nothing will profit them while they cleave to their sins.<br>Jer. 39:11-14 The servants of God alone are prepared for all events;and they are delivered and comforted, while the wicked suffer. Theyoften meet with more kindness from the profane, than from hypocriticalprofessors of godliness. The Lord will raise them up friends, do themgood, and perform all his promises.<br>Jer. 39:15-18 Here is a message to assure Ebed-melech of a recompencefor his great kindness to Jeremiah. Because thou hast put thy trust inme, saith the Lord. God recompenses men's services according to theirprinciples. Those who trust God in the way of duty, as this good mandid, will find that their hope shall not fail in times of the greatestdanger.
Jer 40:	<b>Overview</b><br>Jeremiah is directed to go to Gedaliah. (Jer. 40:1-6) A conspiracyagainst Gedaliah. (Jer. 40:7-16)<br>Jer. 40:1-6 The captain of the guard seems to glory that he had beenGod's instrument to fulfil, what Jeremiah had been God's messenger toforetell. Many can see God's justice and truth with regard to others,who are heedless and blind as to themselves and their own sins. But,sooner or later, all men shall be made sensible that their sin is thecause of all their miseries. Jeremiah has leave to dispose of himself;but is advised to go to Gedaliah, governor of the land under the kingof Babylon. It is doubtful whether Jeremiah acted right in thisdecision. But those who desire the salvation of sinners, and the goodof the church, are apt to expect better times from slight appearances,and they will prefer the hope of being useful, to the most securesituations without it.<br>Jer. 40:7-16 Jeremiah had never in his prophecies spoken of any gooddays for the Jews, to come immediately after the captivity; yetProvidence seemed to encourage such an expectation. But how soon isthis hopeful prospect blighted! When God begins a judgment, he willcomplete it. While pride, ambition, or revenge, bears rule in theheart, men will form new projects, and be restless in mischief, whichcommonly ends in their own ruin. Who would have thought, that after thedestruction of Jerusalem, rebellion would so soon have sprung up? Therecan be no thorough change but what grace makes. And if the miserable,who are kept in everlasting chains for the judgment of the great day,were again permitted to come on earth, the sin and evil of their naturewould be unchanged. Lord, give us new hearts, and that new mind inwhich the new birth consists, since thou hast said we cannot without itsee thy heavenly kingdom.
Jer 41:	<b>Overview</b><br>Ishmael murders Gedaliah. (Jer. 41:1-10) Johanan recovers the captives,and purposes to retire to Egypt. (Jer. 41:11-18)<br>Jer. 41:1-10 Those who hate the worshippers of God, often put on theappearance of piety, that they may the easier hurt them. As death oftenmeets men where they least expect it, we should continually searchwhether we are in such a state and frame of mind, as we would wish tobe found in when called to appear before our Judge. Sometimes theransom of a man's life is his riches. But those who think to bribedeath, saying, Slay us not, for we have treasures in the field, willfind themselves wretchedly deceived. This melancholy history warns us,never to be secure in this world. We never can be sure of peace on thisside heaven.<br>Jer. 41:11-18 The success of villany must be short, and none canprosper who harden their hearts against God. And those justly losecomfort in real fears, who excuse themselves in sin by pretended fears.The removal of a prudent and peaceable ruler, and the succession ofanother who is rash and ambitious, affects the welfare of many. Onlythose are happy and steady who fear the Lord and walk in his ways.
Jer 42:	<b>Overview</b><br>Johanan desires Jeremiah to ask counsel of God. (Jer. 42:1-6) They areassured of safety in Judea, but of destruction in Egypt. (Jer. 42:7-22)<br>Jer. 42:1-6 To serve a turn, Jeremiah is sought out, and the captainsask for his assistance. In every difficult, doubtful case, we must lookto God for direction; and we may still, in faith, pray to be guided bya spirit of wisdom in our hearts, and the leadings of Providence. We donot truly desire to know the mind of God, if we do not fully resolve tocomply with it when we know it. Many promise to do what the Lordrequires, while they hope to have their pride flattered, and theirfavourite lusts spared. Yet something betrays the state of theirhearts.<br>Jer. 42:7-22 If we would know the mind of the Lord in doubtful cases,we must wait as well as pray. God is ever ready to return in mercy tothose he has afflicted; and he never rejects any who rely on hispromises. He has declared enough to silence even the causeless fears ofhis people, which discourge them in the way of duty. Whatever loss orsuffering we may fear from obedience, is provided against in God'sword; and he will protect and deliver all who trust in him and servehim. It is folly to quit our place, especially to quit a holy land,because we meet with trouble in it. And the evils we think to escape bysin, we certainly bring upon ourselves. We may apply this to the commontroubles of life; and those who think to avoid them by changing theirplace, will find that the grievances common to men will meet themwherever they go. Sinners who dissemble with God in solemn professionsespecially should be rebuked with sharpness; for their actions speakmore plainly than words. We know not what is good for ourselves; andwhat we are most fond of, and have our hearts most set upon, oftenproves hurtful, and sometimes fatal.
Jer 43:	<b>Overview</b><br>The leaders carry the people to Egypt. (Jer. 43:1-7) Jeremiah foretellsthe conquest of Egypt. (Jer. 43:8-13)<br>Jer. 43:1-7 Only by pride comes contention, both with God and man. Theypreferred their own wisdom to the revealed will of God. Men deny theScriptures to be the word of God, because they are resolved not toconform themselves to Scripture rules. When men will persist in sin,they charge the best actions to bad motives. These Jews deserted theirown land, and threw themselves out of God's protection. It is the follyof men, that they often ruin themselves by wrong endeavours to mendtheir situation.<br>Jer. 43:8-13 God can find his people wherever they are. The Spirit ofprophecy was not confined to the land of Israel. It is foretold thatNebuchadnezzar should destroy and carry into captivity many of theEgyptians. Thus God makes one wicked man, or wicked nation, a scourgeand plague to another. He will punish those who deceive his professingpeople, or tempt them to rebellion.
Jer 44:	<b>Overview</b><br>The Jews in Egypt persist in idolatry. (Jer. 44:1-14) They refuse toreform. (Jer. 44:15-19) Jeremiah then denounces destruction upon them.(Jer. 44:20-30)<br>Jer. 44:1-14 God reminds the Jews of the sins that brought desolationsupon Judah. It becomes us to warn men of the danger of sin with allseriousness: Oh, do not do it! If you love God, do not, for it isprovoking to him; if you love your own souls, do not, for it isdestructive to them. Let conscience do this for us in the hour oftemptation. The Jews whom God sent into the land of the Chaldeans, werethere, by the power of God's grace, weaned from idolatry; but those whowent by their own perverse will into the land of the Egyptians, werethere more attached than ever to their idolatries. When we thrustourselves without cause or call into places of temptation, it is justwith God to leave us to ourselves. If we walk contrary to God, he willwalk contrary to us. The most awful miseries to which men are exposed,are occasioned by the neglect of offered salvation.<br>Jer. 44:15-19 These daring sinners do not attempt excuses, but declarethey will do that which is forbidden. Those who disobey God, commonlygrow worse and worse, and the heart is more hardened by thedeceitfulness of sin. Here is the real language of the rebelliousheart. Even the afflictions which should have parted them from theirsins, were taken so as to confirm them in their sins. It is sad whenthose who should quicken each other to what is good, and so help oneanother to heaven, harden each other in sin, and so ripen one anotherfor hell. To mingle idolatry with Divine worship, and to reject themediation of Christ, are provoking to God, and ruinous to men. All whoworship images, or honour saints, and angels, and the queen of heaven,should recollect what came from the idolatrous practices of the Jews.<br>Jer. 44:20-30 Whatever evil comes upon us, it is because we have sinnedagainst the Lord; we should therefore stand in awe, and sin not. Sincethey were determined to persist in their idolatry, God would go on topunish them. What little remains of religion were among them, would belost. The creature-comforts and confidences from which we promiseourselves most, may fail as soon as those from which we promiseourselves least; and all are what God makes them, not what we fancythem to be. Well-grounded hopes of our having a part in the Divinemercy, are always united with repentance and obedience.
Jer 45:	<b>Overview</b><br>An encouragement sent to Baruch.<br>Baruch was employed in writing Jeremiah's prophecies, and reading them,see Jer. 36, and was threatened for it by the king. Young beginners inreligion are apt to be discouraged with little difficulties, which theycommonly meet with at first in the service of God. These complaints andfears came from his corruptions. Baruch had raised his expectations toohigh in this world, and that made the distress and trouble he was inharder to be borne. The frowns of the world would not disquiet us, ifwe did not foolishly flatter ourselves with the hopes of its smiles,and court and covet them. What a folly is it then to seek great thingsfor ourselves here, where every thing is little, and nothing certain!The Lord knows the real cause of our fretfulness and despondency betterthan we do, and we should beg of him to examine our hearts, and torepress every wrong desire in us.
Jer 46:	<b>Overview</b><br>The defeat of the Egyptians. (Jer. 46:1-12) Their overthrow after thesiege of Tyre. (Jer. 46:13-26) A promise of comfort to the Jews. (Jer.46:27,28)<br>Jer. 46:1-12 The whole word of God is against those who obey not thegospel of Christ; but it is for those, even of the Gentiles, who turnto Him. The prophecy begins with Egypt. Let them strengthen themselveswith all the art and interest they have, yet it shall be all in vain.The wounds God inflicts on his enemies, cannot be healed by medicines.Power and prosperity soon pass from one to another in this changingworld.<br>Jer. 46:13-28 Those who encroached on others, shall now be themselvesencroached on. Egypt is now like a very fair heifer, not accustomed tothe yoke of subjection; but destruction comes out of the north: theChaldeans shall come. Comfort and peace are spoken to the Israel ofGod, designed to encourage them when the judgments of God were abroadamong the nations. He will be with them, and only correct them inmeasure; and will not punish them with everlasting destruction from hispresence.
Jer 47:	<b>Overview</b><br>The calamities of the Philistines.<br>The Philistines had always been enemies to Israel; but the Chaldeanarmy shall overflow their land like a deluge. Those whom God willspoil, must be spoiled. For when the Lord intends to destroy thewicked, he will cut off every helper. So deplorable are the desolationsof war, that the blessings of peace are most desirable. But we mustsubmit to His appointments who ordains all in perfect wisdom andjustice.
Jer 48:	<b>Overview</b><br>Prophecies against Moab for pride and security. (Jer. 48:1-13) Forcarnal confidence and contempt of God. (Jer. 48:14-47)<br>Jer. 48:1-13. The Chaldeans are to destroy the Moabites. We should bethankful that we are required to seek the salvation of men's lives, andthe salvation of their souls, not to shed their blood; but we shall bethe more without excuse if we do this pleasant work deceitfully. Thecities shall be laid in ruins, and the country shall be wasted. Therewill be great sorrow. There will be great hurry. If any could givewings to sinners, still they could not fly out of the reach of Divineindignation. There are many who persist in unrepented iniquity, yetlong enjoy outward prosperity. They had been long corrupt andunreformed, secure and sensual in prosperity. They have no changes oftheir peace and prosperity, therefore their hearts and lives areunchanged, Ps. 55:19.<br>Jer. 48:14-47. The destruction of Moab is further prophesied, to awakenthem by national repentance and reformation to prevent the trouble, orby a personal repentance and reformation to prepare for it. In readingthis long roll of threatenings, and mediating on the terror, it will beof more use to us to keep in view the power of God's anger and theterror of his judgments, and to have our hearts possessed with a holyawe of God and of his wrath, than to search into all the figures andexpressions here used. Yet it is not perpetual destruction. The chapterends with a promise of their return out of captivity in the latterdays. Even with Moabites God will not contend for ever, nor be alwayswroth. The Jews refer it to the days of the Messiah; then the captivesof the Gentiles, under the yoke of sin and Satan, shall be brought backby Divine grace, which shall make them free indeed.
Jer 49:	<b>Overview</b><br>Prophecies relative to the Ammonites. (Jer. 49:1-6) The Edomites. (Jer.49:7-22) The Syrians. (Jer. 49:23-27) The Kedarenes. (Jer. 49:28-33)The Elamites. (Jer. 49:34-39)<br>Jer. 49:1-6. Might often prevails against right among men, yet thatmight shall be controlled by the Almighty, who judges aright; and thosewill find themselves mistaken, who, like the Ammonites, think everything their own on which they can lay their hands. The Lord will callmen to account for every instance of dishonesty, especially to thedestitute.<br>Jer. 49:7-22 The Edomites were old enemies to the Israel of God. Buttheir day is now at hand; it is foretold, not only to warn them, butfor the sake of the Israel of God, whose afflictions were aggravated bythem. Thus Divine judgments go round from nation to nation; the earthis full of commotion, and nothing can escape the ministers of Divinevengeance. The righteousness of God is to be observed amidst theviolence of men.<br>Jer. 49:23-27 How easily God can dispirit those nations that have beenmost celebrated for valour! Damascus waxes feeble. It was a city ofjoy, having all the delights of the sons of men. But those deceivethemselves who place their happiness in carnal joys.<br>Jer. 49:28-33 Nebuchadnezzar would make desolation among the people ofKedar, who dwelt in the deserts of Arabia. He who conquered many strongcities, will not leave those unconquered that dwell in tents. He willdo this to gratify his own covetousness and ambition; but God orders itfor correcting an unthankful people, and for warning a careless worldto expect trouble when they seem most safe. They shall flee, get faroff, and dwell deep in the deserts; they shall be dispersed. Butprivacy and obscurity are not always protection and security.<br>Jer. 49:34-39 The Elamites were the Persians; they acted against God'sIsrael, and must be reckoned with. Evil pursues sinners. God will makethem know that he reigns. Yet the destruction of Elam shall not be forever. But this promise was to have its full accomplishment in the daysof the Messiah. In reading the Divine assurance of the destruction ofall the enemies of the church, the believer sees that the issue of theholy war is not doubtful. It is blessed to recollect, that He who isfor us, is more than all against us. And he will subdue the enemies ofour souls.
Jer 50:	<b>Overview</b><br>The ruin of Babylon. (Jer. 50:1-3,8-16,21-32,35-46;) The redemption ofGod's people. (Jer. 50:4-7,17-20,33,34)<br>Jer. 50:1-7 The king of Babylon was kind to Jeremiah, yet the prophetmust foretell the ruin of that kingdom. If our friends are God'senemies, we dare not speak peace to them. The destruction of Babylon isspoken of as done thoroughly. Here is a word for the comfort of theJews. They shall return to their God first, then to their own land; thepromise of their conversion and reformation makes way for the otherpromises. Their tears flow not from the sorrow of the world, as whenthey went into captivity, but from godly sorrow. They shall seek afterthe Lord as their God, and have no more to do with idols. They shallthink of returning to their own country. This represents the return ofpoor souls to God. In true converts there are sincere desires to attainthe end, and constant cares to keep in the way. Their present case islamented as very sad. The sins of professing Christians never willexcuse those who rejoice in destroying them.<br>Jer. 50:8-20 The desolation that shall be brought upon Babylon is setforth in a variety of expressions. The cause of this destruction is thewrath of the Lord. Babylon shall be wholly desolated; for she hathsinned against the Lord. Sin makes men a mark for the arrows of God'sjudgments. The mercy promised to the Israel of God, shall not onlyaccompany, but arise from the destruction of Babylon. These sheep shallbe gathered from the deserts, and put again into good pasture. All whoreturn to God and their duty, shall find satisfaction of soul in sodoing. Deliverances out of trouble are comforts indeed, when fruits ofthe forgiveness of sin.<br>Jer. 50:21-32 The forces are mustered and empowered to destroy Babylon.Let them do what God demands, and they shall bring to pass what hethreatens. The pride of men's hearts sets God against them, and ripensthem apace for ruin. Babylon's pride must be her ruin; she has beenproud against the Holy One of Israel; who can keep those up whom Godwill throw down?<br>Jer. 50:33-46 It is Israel's comfort in distress, that, though they areweak, their Redeemer is strong. This may be applied to believers, whocomplain of the dominion of sin and corruption, and of their ownweakness and manifold infirmities. Their Redeemer is able to keep whatthey commit to him; and sin shall not have dominion over them. He willgive them that rest which remains for the people of God. Also here isBabylon's sin, and their punishment. The sins are, idolatry andpersecution. He that will not save his people in their sins, never willcountenance the wickedness of his open enemies. The judgments of Godfor these sins will lay them waste. In the judgments denounced againstprosperous Babylon, and the mercies promised to afflicted Israel, welearn to choose to suffer affliction with the people of God, ratherthan to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season.
Jer 51:	<b>Overview</b><br>Babylon's doom; God's controversy with her; encouragements from thenceto the Israel of God. (Jer. 51:1-58) The confirming of this. (Jer.51:59-64)<br>Jer. 51:1-58 The particulars of this prophecy are dispersed andinterwoven, and the same things left and returned to again. Babylon isabundant in treasures, yet neither her waters nor her wealth shallsecure her. Destruction comes when they did not think of it. Whereverwe are, in the greatest depths, at the greatest distances, we are toremember the Lord our God; and in the times of the greatest fears andhopes, it is most needful to remember the Lord. The feeling excited byBabylon's fall is the same with the New Testament Babylon, Rev.18:9,19. The ruin of all who support idolatry, infidelity, andsuperstition, is needful for the revival of true godliness; and thethreatening prophecies of Scripture yield comfort in this view. Thegreat seat of antichristian tyranny, idolatry, and superstition, thepersecutor of true Christians, is as certainly doomed to destruction asancient Babylon. Then will vast multitudes mourn for sin, and seek theLord. Then will the lost sheep of the house of Israel be brought backto the fold of the good Shepherd, and stray no more. And the exactfulfilment of these ancient prophecies encourages us to faith in allthe promises and prophecies of the sacred Scriptures.<br>Jer. 51:59-64 This prophecy is sent to Babylon, to the captives there,by Seraiah, who is to read it to his countrymen in captivity. Let themwith faith see the end of these threatening powers, and comfortthemselves herewith. When we see what this world is, how glittering itsshows, and how flattering its proposals, let us read in the book of theLord that it shall shortly be desolate. The book must be thrown intothe river Euphrates. The fall of the New Testament Babylon is thusrepresented, Rev. 18:21. Those that sink under the weight of God'swrath and curse, sink for ever. Babylon, and every antichrist, willsoon sink and rise no more for ever. Let us hope in God's word, andquietly wait for his salvation; then we shall see, but shall not share,the destruction of the wicked.
Jer 52:	<b>Overview</b><br>The fate of Zedekiah. (Jer. 52:1-11) The destruction of Jerusalem.(Jer. 52:12-23) The captivities. (Jer. 52:24-30) The advancement ofJehoiachin. (Jer. 52:31-34)<br>Jer. 52:1-11 This fruit of sin we should pray against above any thing;Cast me not away from thy presence, Ps. 51:11. None are cast out ofGod's presence but those who by sin have first thrown themselves out.Zedekiah's flight was in vain, for there is no escaping the judgmentsof God; they come upon the sinner, and overtake him, let him flee wherehe will.<br>Jer. 52:12-23 The Chaldean army made woful havoc. But nothing is soparticularly related here, as the carrying away of the articles in thetemple. The remembrance of their beauty and value shows us the more theevil of sin.<br>Jer. 52:24-30 The leaders of the Jews caused them to err; but now theyare, in particular, made monuments of Divine justice. Here is anaccount of two earlier captivities. This people often were wonders bothof judgment and mercy.<br>Jer. 52:31-34 See this history of king Jehoiachin in II Kin. 25:27-30.Those under oppression will find it is not in vain for them to hope andquietly to wait for the salvation of the Lord. Our times are in God'shand, for the hearts of all we have to deal with are so. May we beenabled, more and more, to rest on the Rock of Ages, and to lookforward with holy faith to that hour, when the Lord will bring againZion, and overthrow all the enemies of the church.
Lam 1:	<b>Overview</b><br>The miserable state of Jerusalem, the just consequences of its sins.(Lam. 1:1-11) Jerusalem represented as a captive female, lamenting, andseeking the mercy of God. (Lam. 1:12-22)<br>Lam. 1:1-11 The prophet sometimes speaks in his own person; at othertimes Jerusalem, as a distressed female, is the speaker, or some of theJews. The description shows the miseries of the Jewish nation.Jerusalem became a captive and a slave, by reason of the greatness ofher sins; and had no rest from suffering. If we allow sin, our greatestadversary, to have dominion over us, justly will other enemies also besuffered to have dominion. The people endured the extremities of famineand distress. In this sad condition Jerusalem acknowledged her sin, andentreated the Lord to look upon her case. This is the only way to makeourselves easy under our burdens; for it is the just anger of the Lordfor man's transgressions, that has filled the earth with sorrows,lamentations, sickness, and death.<br>Lam. 1:12-22 Jerusalem, sitting dejected on the ground, calls on thosethat passed by, to consider whether her example did not concern them.Her outward sufferings were great, but her inward sufferings wereharder to bear, through the sense of guilt. Sorrow for sin must begreat sorrow, and must affect the soul. Here we see the evil of sin,and may take warning to flee from the wrath to come. Whatever may belearned from the sufferings of Jerusalem, far more may be learned fromthe sufferings of Christ. Does he not from the cross speak to every oneof us? Does he not say, Is it nothing to you, all ye that pass by? Letall our sorrows lead us to the cross of Christ, lead us to mark hisexample, and cheerfully to follow him.
Lam 2:	<b>Overview</b><br>Lamentation for the misery of Jerusalem.<br>Lam. 2:1-9 A sad representation is here made of the state of God'schurch, of Jacob and Israel; but the notice seems mostly to refer tothe hand of the Lord in their calamities. Yet God is not an enemy tohis people, when he is angry with them and corrects them. And gates andbars stand in no stead when God withdraws his protection. It is justwith God to cast down those by judgments, who debase themselves by sin;and to deprive those of the benefit and comfort of sabbaths andordinances, who have not duly valued nor observed them. What shouldthey do with Bibles, who make no improvement of them? Those who misuseGod's prophets, justly lose them. It becomes necessary, though painful,to turn the thoughts of the afflicted to the hand of God lifted upagainst them, and to their sins as the source of their miseries.<br>Lam. 2:10-22 Causes for lamentation are described. Multitudes perishedby famine. Even little children were slain by their mother's hands, andeaten, according to the threatening, Deut. 28:53. Multitudes fell bythe sword. Their false prophets deceived them. And their neighbourslaughed at them. It is a great sin to jest at others' miseries, andadds much affliction to the afflicted. Their enemies triumphed overthem. The enemies of the church are apt to take its shocks for itsruins; but they will find themselves deceived. Calls to lamentation aregiven; and comforts for the cure of these lamentations are sought.Prayer is a salve for every sore, even the sorest; a remedy for everymalady, even the most grievous. Our business in prayer is to refer ourcase to the Lord, and leave it with him. His will be done. Let us fearGod, and walk humbly before him, and take heed lest we fall.
Lam 3:	<b>Overview</b><br>The faithful lament their calamities, and hope in God's mercies.<br>Lam. 3:1-20 The prophet relates the more gloomy and discouraging partof his experience, and how he found support and relief. In the time ofhis trial the Lord had become terrible to him. It was an afflictionthat was misery itself; for sin makes the cup of affliction a bittercup. The struggle between unbelief and faith is often very severe. Butthe weakest believer is wrong, if he thinks that his strength and hopeare perished from the Lord.<br>Lam. 3:21-36 Having stated his distress and temptation, the prophetshows how he was raised above it. Bad as things are, it is owing to themercy of God that they are not worse. We should observe what makes forus, as well as what is against us. God's compassions fail not; of thiswe have fresh instances every morning. Portions on earth are perishingthings, but God is a portion for ever. It is our duty, and will be ourcomfort and satisfaction, to hope and quietly to wait for the salvationof the Lord. Afflictions do and will work very much for good: many havefound it good to bear this yoke in their youth; it has made many humbleand serious, and has weaned them from the world, who otherwise wouldhave been proud and unruly. If tribulation work patience, that patiencewill work experience, and that experience a hope that makes notashamed. Due thoughts of the evil of sin, and of our own sinfulness,will convince us that it is of the Lord's mercies we are not consumed.If we cannot say with unwavering voice, The Lord is my portion; may wenot say, I desire to have Him for my portion and salvation, and in hisword do I hope? Happy shall we be, if we learn to receive affliction aslaid upon us by the hand of God.<br>Lam. 3:37-41 While there is life there is hope; and instead ofcomplaining that things are bad, we should encourage ourselves with thehope they will be better. We are sinful men, and what we complain of,is far less than our sins deserve. We should complain to God, and notof him. We are apt, in times of calamity, to reflect on other people'sways, and blame them; but our duty is to search and try our own ways,that we may turn from evil to God. Our hearts must go with our prayers.If inward impressions do not answer to outward expressions, we mockGod, and deceive ourselves.<br>Lam. 3:42-54 The more the prophet looked on the desolations, the morehe was grieved. Here is one word of comfort. While they continuedweeping, they continued waiting; and neither did nor would expectrelief and succour from any but the Lord.<br>Lam. 3:55-66 Faith comes off conqueror, for in these verses the prophetconcludes with some comfort. Prayer is the breath of the new man,drawing in the air of mercy in petitions, and returning it in praises;it proves and maintains the spiritual life. He silenced their fears,and quieted their spirits. Thou saidst, Fear not. This was the languageof God's grace, by the witness of his Spirit with their spirits. Andwhat are all our sorrows, compared with those of the Redeemer? He willdeliver his people from every trouble, and revive his church from everypersecution. He will save believers with everlasting salvation, whilehis enemies perish with everlasting destruction.
Lam 4:	<b>Overview</b><br>The deplorable state of the nation is contrasted with its ancientprosperity.<br>Lam. 4:1-12 What a change is here! Sin tarnishes the beauty of the mostexalted powers and the most excellent gifts; but that gold, tried inthe fire, which Christ bestows, never will be taken from us; itsoutward appearance may be dimmed, but its real value can never bechanged. The horrors of the siege and destruction of Jerusalem areagain described. Beholding the sad consequences of sin in the church ofold, let us seriously consider to what the same causes may justly bringdown the church now. But, Lord, though we have gone from thee inrebellion, yet turn to us, and turn our hearts to thee, that we mayfear thy name. Come to us, bless us with awakening, converting,renewing, confirming grace.<br>Lam. 4:13-20 Nothing ripens a people more for ruin, nor fills themeasure faster, than the sins of priests and prophets. The king himselfcannot escape, for Divine vengeance pursues him. Our anointed Kingalone is the life of our souls; we may safely live under his shadow,and rejoice in Him in the midst of our enemies, for He is the true Godand eternal life.<br>Lam. 4:21,22 Here it is foretold that an end should be put to Zion'stroubles. Not the fulness of punishment deserved, but of what God hasdetermined to inflict. An end shall be put to Edom's triumphs. All thetroubles of the church and of the believer will soon be accomplished.And the doom of their enemies approaches. The Lord will bring theirsins to light, and they shall lie down in eternal sorrow. Edom hererepresents all the enemies of the church. And the corruption, and sinof Israel, which the prophet has proved to be universal, justifies thejudgments of the Lord. It shows the need of that grace in Christ Jesus,which the sin and corruption of all mankind make so necessary.
Lam 5:	<b>Overview</b><br>The Jewish nation supplicating the Divine favour.<br>Lam. 5:1-16 Is any afflicted? Let him pray; and let him in prayer pourout his complaint to God. The people of God do so here; they complainnot of evils feared, but of evils felt. If penitent and patient underwhat we suffer for the sins of our fathers, we may expect that He whopunishes, will return in mercy to us. They acknowledge, Woe unto usthat we have sinned! All our woes are owing to our own sin and folly.Though our sins and God's just displeasure cause our sufferings, we mayhope in his pardoning mercy, his sanctifying grace, and his kindprovidence. But the sins of a man's whole life will be punished withvengeance at last, unless he obtains an interest in Him who bare oursins in his own body on the tree.<br>Lam. 5:17-22 The people of God express deep concern for the ruins ofthe temple, more than for any other of their calamities. But whateverchanges there are on earth, God is still the same, and remains for everwise and holy, just and good; with Him there is no variableness norshadow of turning. They earnestly pray to God for mercy and grace; Turnus to thee, O Lord. God never leaves any till they first leave him; ifhe turns them to him in a way of duty, no doubt he will quickly returnto them in a way of mercy. If God by his grace renew our hearts, hewill by his favour renew our days. Troubles may cause our hearts to befaint, and our eyes to be dim, but the way to the mercy-seat of ourreconciled God is open. Let us, in all our trials, put our whole trustand confidence in his mercy; let us confess our sins, and pour out ourhearts before him. Let us watch against repinings and despondency; forwe surely know, that it shall be well in the end with all that trustin, fear, love, and serve the Lord. Are not the Lord's judgments in theearth the same as in Jeremiah's days? Let Zion then be remembered by usin our prayers, and her welfare be sought above every earthly joy.Spare, Lord, spare thy people, and give not thine heritage to reproach,for the heathen to rule over them.
Eze 1:	<b>Overview</b><br>Ezekiel's vision of God, and of the angelic host. (Ezek. 1:1-14) Theconduct of Divine Providence. (Ezek. 1:15-25) A revelation of the Sonof man upon his heavenly throne. (Ezek. 1:26-28)<br>Ezek. 1:1-14 It is a mercy to have the word of God brought to us, and aduty to attend to it diligently, when we are in affliction. The voiceof God came in the fulness of light and power, by the Holy Spirit.These visions seem to have been sent to possess the prophet's mind withgreat and high thoughts of God. To strike terror upon sinners. To speakcomfort to those that feared God, and humbled themselves. In Ezek.1:4-14, is the first part of the vision, which represents God asattended and served by a vast company of angels, who are all hismessengers, his ministers, doing his commandments. This vision wouldimpress the mind with solemn awe and fear of the Divine displeasure,yet raise expectations of blessings. The fire is surrounded with aglory. Though we cannot by searching find out God to perfection, yet wesee the brightness round about it. The likeness of the living creaturescame out of the midst of the fire; angels derive their being and powerfrom God. They have the understanding of a man, and far more. A lionexcels in strength and boldness. An ox excels in diligence andpatience, and unwearied discharge of the work he has to do. An eagleexcels in quickness and piercing sight, and in soaring high; and theangels, who excel man in all these respects, put on these appearances.The angels have wings; and whatever business God sends them upon, theylose no time. They stood straight, and firm, and steady. They had notonly wings for motion, but hands for action. Many persons are quick,who are not active; they hurry about, but do nothing to purpose; theyhave wings, but no hands. But wherever the angels' wings carried them,they carried hands with them, to be doing what duty required. Whateverservice they went about, they went every one straight forward. When wego straight, we go forward; when we serve God with one heart, weperform work. They turned not when they went. They made no mistakes;and their work needed not to be gone over again. They turned not fromtheir business to trifle with any thing. They went whithersoever theSpirit of God would have them go. The prophet saw these livingcreatures by their own light, for their appearance was like burningcoals of fire; they are seraphim, or "burners;" denoting the ardour oftheir love to God, and fervent zeal in his service. We may learnprofitable lessons from subjects we cannot fully enter into orunderstand. But let us attend to the things which relate to our peaceand duty, and leave secret things to the Lord, to whom alone theybelong.<br>Ezek. 1:15-25 Providence, represented by the wheels, produces changes.Sometimes one spoke of the wheel is uppermost, sometimes another; butthe motion of the wheel on its own axletree is regular and steady. Weneed not despond in adversity; the wheels are turning round and willraise us in due time, while those who presume in prosperity know nothow soon they may be cast down. The wheel is near the living creatures;the angels are employed as ministers of God's providence. The spirit ofthe living creatures was in the wheels; the same wisdom, power, andholiness of God, that guide and govern the angels, by them order allevents in this lower world. The wheel had four faces, denoting that theprovidence of God exerts itself in all parts. Look every way upon thewheel of providence, it has a face toward you. Their appearance andwork were as a wheel in the middle of a wheel. The disposals ofProvidence seem to us dark, perplexed, and unaccountable, yet are allwisely ordered for the best. The motion of these wheels was steady,regular, and constant. They went as the Spirit directed, thereforereturned not. We should not have to undo that by repentance which wehave done amiss, if we followed the guidance of the Spirit. The rings,or rims of the wheels were so vast, that when put in motion the prophetwas afraid to look upon them. The consideration of the height and depthof God's counsel should awe us. They were full of eyes round about. Themotions of Providence are all directed by infinite Wisdom. All eventsare determined by the eyes of the Lord, which are in every placebeholding the evil and the good; for there is no such thing as chanceor fortune. The firmament above was a crystal, glorious, but terriblyso. That which we take to be a dark cloud, is to God clear as crystal,through which he looks upon all the inhabitants of the earth. When theangels had roused a careless world, they let down their wings, thatGod's voice might be plainly heard. The voice of Providence is to openmen's ears to the voice of the word. Sounds on earth should awaken ourattention to the voice from heaven; for how shall we escape, if we turnaway from Him that speaks from thence.<br>Ezek. 1:26-28 The eternal Son, the second Person in the Trinity, whoafterwards took the human nature, is here denoted. The first thingobserved was a throne. It is a throne of glory, a throne of grace, athrone of triumph, a throne of government, a throne of judgment. It isgood news to men, that the throne above the firmament is filled withOne who appears, even there, in the likeness of a man. The throne issurrounded with a rainbow, the well-known emblem of the covenant,representing God's mercy and covenanted love to his people. The fire ofGod's wrath was breaking out against Jerusalem, but bounds should beset to it; he would look upon the bow, and remember the covenant. Allthe prophet saw was only to prepare him for what he was to hear. Whenhe fell on his face, he heard the voice of One that spake. God delightsto teach the humble. Let sinners, then, humble themselves before him.And let believers think upon his glory, that they may be graduallychanged into his image by the Spirit of the Lord.
Eze 2:	<b>Overview</b><br>The prophet is directed what he is to do. (Ezek. 2:1-5) And encouragedto be resolute, faithful, and devoted. (Ezek. 2:6-10)<br>Ezek. 2:1-5 Lest Ezekiel should be lifted up with the abundance of therevelations, he is put in mind that still he is a son of man, a weak,mortal creature. As Christ usually called himself the Son of man, itwas also an honourable distinction. Ezekiel's posture showed reverence,but his standing up would be a posture of greater readiness and fitnessfor business. God will speak to us, when we stand ready to do what hecommands us. As Ezekiel had not strength of his own, the Spirit enteredinto him. God is graciously pleased to work in us whatever he requiresof us. The Holy Spirit sets us upon our feet, by inclining our wills toour duty. Thus, when the Lord calls upon the sinner to awake, andattend to the concerns of his soul, the Spirit of life and grace comeswith the call. Ezekiel is sent with a message to the children ofIsrael. Many might treat his message with contempt, yet they shouldknow by the event that a prophet had been sent to them. God will beglorified, and his word made honourable, whether it be a savour of lifeunto life, or of death unto death.<br>Ezek. 2:6-10 Those who will do any thing to purpose in the service ofGod, must not fear men. Wicked men are as briers and thorns; but theyare nigh unto cursing, and their end is to be burned. The prophet mustbe faithful to the souls of those to whom he was sent. All who speakfrom God to others, must obey his voice. The discoveries of sin, andthe warnings of wrath, should be matter of lamentation. And thoseacquainted with the word of God, will clearly perceive it is filledwith woe to impenitent sinners; and that all the precious promises ofthe gospel are for the repenting, believing servants of the Lord.
Eze 3:	<b>Overview</b><br>The preparation of the prophet for his work. (Ezek. 3:1-11) His office,as that of a watchman. (Ezek. 3:12-2) The restraining and restoring hisspeech. (Ezek. 3:22-27)<br>Ezek. 3:1-11 Ezekiel was to receive the truths of God as the food forhis soul, and to feed upon them by faith, and he would be strengthened.Gracious souls can receive those truths of God with delight, whichspeak terror to the wicked. He must speak all that, and that only,which God spake to him. How can we better speak God's mind than withhis words? If disappointed as to his people, he must not be offended.The Ninevites were wrought upon by Jonah's preaching, when Israel wasunhumbled and unreformed. We must leave this unto the Divinesovereignty, and say, Lord, thy judgments are a great deep. They willnot regard the word of the prophet, for they will not regard the rod ofGod. Christ promises to strengthen him. He must continue earnest inpreaching, whatever the success might be.<br>Ezek. 3:12-21 This mission made the holy angels rejoice. All this wasto convince Ezekiel, that the God who sent him had power to bear himout in his work. He was overwhelmed with grief for the sins andmiseries of his people, and overpowered by the glory of the vision hehad seen. And however retirement, meditation, and communion with Godmay be sweet, the servant of the Lord must prepare to serve hisgeneration. The Lord told the prophet he had appointed him a watchmanto the house of Israel. If we warn the wicked, we are not chargeablewith their ruin. Though such passages refer to the national covenantmade with Israel, they are equally to be applied to the final state ofall men under every dispensation. We are not only to encourage andcomfort those who appear to be righteous, but they are to be warned,for many have grown high-minded and secure, have fallen, and even diedin their sins. Surely then the hearers of the gospel should desirewarnings, and even reproofs.<br>Ezek. 3:22-27 Let us own ourselves for ever indebted to the mediationof Christ, for the blessed intercourse between God and man; and a truebeliever will say, I am never less alone than when thus alone. When theLord opened Ezekiel's mouth, he was to deliver his message boldly, toplace life and death, the blessing and the curse, before the people,and leave them to their choice.
Eze 4:	<b>Overview</b><br>The siege of Jerusalem. (Ezek. 4:1-8) The famine the inhabitants wouldsuffer. (Ezek. 4:9-17)<br>Ezek. 4:1-8 The prophet was to represent the siege of Jerusalem bysigns. He was to lie on his left side for a number of days, supposed tobe equal to the years from the establishment of idolatry. All that theprophet sets before the children of his people, about the destructionof Jerusalem, is to show that sin is the provoking cause of the ruin ofthat once flourishing city.<br>Ezek. 4:9-17 The bread which was Ezekiel's support, was to be made ofcoarse grain and pulse mixed together, seldom used except in times ofurgent scarcity, and of this he was only to take a small quantity. Thuswas figured the extremity to which the Jews were to be reduced duringthe siege and captivity. Ezekiel does not plead, Lord, from my youth Ihave been brought up delicately, and never used to any thing like this;but that he had been brought up conscientiously, and never had eatenany thing forbidden by the law. It will be comfortable when we arebrought to suffer hardships, if our hearts can witness that we havealways been careful to keep even from the appearance of evil. See whatwoful work sin makes, and acknowledge the righteousness of God herein.Their plenty having been abused to luxury and excess, they were justlypunished by famine. When men serve not God with cheerfulness in theabundance of all things, God will make them serve their enemies in thewant of all things.
Eze 5:	<b>Overview</b><br>A type of hair, showing the judgments about to come upon the Jews.(Ezek. 5:1-4) These awful judgments are declared. (Ezek. 5:5-17)<br>Ezek. 5:1-4 The prophet must shave off the hair of his head and beard,which signifies God's utter rejecting and abandoning that people. Onepart must be burned in the midst of the city, denoting the multitudesthat should perish by famine and pestilence. Another part was to be cutin pieces, representing the many who were slain by the sword. Anotherpart was to be scattered in the wind, denoting the carrying away ofsome into the land of the conqueror, and the flight of others into theneighbouring countries for shelter. A small quantity of the thirdportion was to be bound in his shirts, as that of which he is verycareful. But few were reserved. To whatever refuge sinners flee, thefire and sword of God's wrath will consume them.<br>Ezek. 5:5-17 The sentence passed upon Jerusalem is very dreadful, themanner of expression makes it still more so. Who is able to stand inGod's sight when he is angry? Those who live and die impenitent, willperish for ever unpitied; there is a day coming when the Lord will notspare. Let not persons or churches, who change the Lord's statutes,expect to escape the doom of Jerusalem. Let us endeavour to adorn thedoctrine of God our Saviour in all things. Sooner or later God's wordwill prove itself true.
Eze 6:	<b>Overview</b><br>The Divine judgments for idolatry. (Ezek. 6:1-7) A remnant shall besaved. (Ezek. 6:8-10) The calamities are to be lamented. (Ezek.6:11-14)<br>Ezek. 6:1-7. War desolates persons, places, and things esteemed mostsacred. God ruins idolatries even by the hands of idolaters. It is justwith God to make that a desolation, which we make an idol. Thesuperstitions to which many trust for safety, often cause their ruin.And the day is at hand, when idols and idolatry will be as thoroughlydestroyed from the professedly Christian church as they were from amongthe Jews.<br>Ezek. 6:8-10 A remnant of Israel should be left; at length they shouldremember the Lord, their obligations to him, and rebellion against him.True penitents see sin to be that abominable thing which the Lordhates. Those who truly loathe sin, loathe themselves because of sin.They give glory to God by their repentance. Whatever brings men toremember Him, and their sins against him, should be regarded as ablessing.<br>Ezek. 6:11-14 It is our duty to be affected, not only with our own sinsand sufferings, but to look with compassion upon the miseries wickedpeople bring upon themselves. Sin is a desolating thing; therefore,stand in awe, and sin not. If we know the worth of souls, and thedanger to which unbelievers are exposed, we shall deem every sinner whotakes refuge in Jesus from the wrath to come, an abundant recompencefor all contempt or opposition we may meet with.
Eze 7:	<b>Overview</b><br>The desolation of the land. (Ezek. 7:1-15) The distress of the few whoshould escape. (Ezek. 7:16-22) The captivity. (Ezek. 7:23-27)<br>Ezek. 7:1-15 The abruptness of this prophecy, and the many repetitions,show that the prophet was deeply affected by the prospect of thesecalamities. Such will the destruction of sinners be; for none can avoidit. Oh that the wickedness of the wicked might end before it bring themto an end! Trouble is to the impenitent only an evil, it hardens theirhearts, and stirs up their corruptions; but there are those to whom itis sanctified by the grace of God, and made a means of much good. Theday of real trouble is near, not a mere echo or rumour of troubles.Whatever are the fruits of God's judgments, our sin is the root ofthem. These judgments shall be universal. And God will be glorified inall. Now is the day of the Lord's patience and mercy, but the time ofthe sinner's trouble is at hand.<br>Ezek. 7:16-22 Sooner or later, sin will cause sorrow; and those whowill not repent of their sin, may justly be left to pine away in it.There are many whose wealth is their snare and ruin; and the gainingthe world is the losing of their souls. Riches profit not in the day ofwrath. The wealth of this world has not that in it which will answerthe desires of the soul, or be any satisfaction to it in a day ofdistress. God's temple shall stand them in no stead. Those are unworthyto be honoured with the form of godliness, who will not be governed byits power.<br>Ezek. 7:23-27 Whoever break the bands of God's law, will findthemselves bound and held by the chains of his judgments. Since theyencouraged one another to sin, God would dishearten them. All mustneeds be in trouble, when God comes to judge them according to theirdeserts. May the Lord enable us to seek that good part which shall notbe taken away.
Eze 8:	<b>Overview</b><br>The idolatries committed by the Jewish rulers. (Ezek. 8:1-6) Thesuperstitions to which the Jews were then devoted, the Egyptian. (Ezek.8:7-12) The Phoenician. (Ezek. 8:13,14) The Persian. (Ezek. 8:15,16)The heinousness of their sin. (Ezek. 8:17,18)<br>Ezek. 8:1-6 The glorious personage Ezekiel beheld in vision, seemed totake hold upon him, and he was conveyed in spirit to Jerusalem. There,in the inner court of the temple, was prepared a place for some baseidol. The whole was presented in vision to the prophet. If it shouldplease God to give any man a clear view of his glory and majesty, andof all the abominations committing in any one city, he would then admitthe justice of the severest punishments God should inflict thereon.<br>Ezek. 8:7-12 A secret place was, as it were, opened, where the prophetsaw creatures painted on the walls, and a number of the elders ofIsrael worshipped before them. No superiority in worldly matters willpreserve men from lust, or idolatries, when they are left to their owndeceitful hearts; and those who are soon wearied in the service of God,often grudge no toil nor expense when following their superstitions.When hypocrites screen themselves behind the wall of an outwardprofession, there is some hole or other left in the wall, somethingthat betrays them to those who look diligently. There is a great dealof secret wickedness in the world. They think themselves out of God'ssight. But those are ripe indeed for ruin, who lay the blame of theirsins upon the Lord.<br>Ezek. 8:13-18 The yearly lamenting for Tammuz was attended withinfamous practices; and the worshippers of the sun here described, aresupposed to have been priests. The Lord appeals to the prophetconcerning the heinousness of the crime; "and lo, they put the branchto their nose," denoting some custom used by idolaters in honour of theidols they served. The more we examine human nature and our own hearts,the more abominations we shall discover; and the longer the believersearches himself, the more he will humble himself before God, and themore will he value the fountain open for sin, and seek to wash therein.
Eze 9:	<b>Overview</b><br>A vision denoting the destruction of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, andthe departure of the symbol of the Divine presence.<br>Ezek. 9:1-4 It is a great comfort to believers, that in the midst ofdestroyers and destructions, there is a Mediator, a great High Priest,who has an interest in heaven, and in whom saints on earth have aninterest. The representation of the Divine glory from above the ark,removed to the threshold, denoted that the Lord was about to leave hismercy-seat, and to pronounce judgment on the people. The distinguishingcharacter of this remnant that is to be saved, is such as sigh and cryto God in prayer, because of the abominations in Jerusalem. Those whokeep pure in times of general wickedness, God will keep safe in timesof general trouble and distress.<br>Ezek. 9:5-11 The slaughter must begin at the sanctuary, that all maysee and know that the Lord hates sin most in those nearest to him. Hewho was appointed to protect, reported the matter. Christ is faithfulto the trust reposed in him. Is he commanded by his Father to secureeternal life to the chosen remnant? He says, Of all that thou hastgiven me, I have lost none. If others perish, and we are saved, we mustascribe the difference wholly to the mercy of our God, for we too havedeserved wrath. Let us still continue to plead in behalf of others. Butwhere the Lord shows no mercy he does no injustice; he only recompensesmen's ways.
Eze 10:	<b>Overview</b><br>A vision of the burning of the city. (Ezek. 10:1-7) The Divine glorydeparting from the temple. (Ezek. 10:8-22)<br>Ezek. 10:1-7 The fire being taken from between the wheels, under thecherubim, Ezek. 1:13, seems to have signified the wrath of God to beexecuted upon Jerusalem. It intimated that the fire of Divine wrath,which kindles judgment upon a people, is just and holy; and in thegreat day, the earth, and all the works that are therein, will be burntup.<br>Ezek. 10:8-22 Ezekiel sees the working of Divine providence in thegovernment of the lower world, and the affairs of it. When God isleaving a people in displeasure, angels above, and all events below,further his departure. The Spirit of life, the Spirit of God, directsall creatures, in heaven and on earth, so as to make them serve theDivine purpose. God removes by degrees from a provoking people; and,when ready to depart, would return to them, if they were a repenting,praying people. Let this warn sinners to seek the Lord while he may befound, and to call on him while he is near, and cause us all to walkhumbly and watchfully with our God.
Eze 11:	<b>Overview</b><br>Divine judgments against the wicked at Jerusalem. (Ezek. 11:1-13)Divine favour towards those in captivity. (Ezek. 11:14-21) The Divinepresence forsakes the city. (Ezek. 11:22-25)<br>Ezek. 11:1-13 Where Satan cannot persuade men to look upon the judgmentto come as uncertain, he gains his point by persuading them to lookupon it as at a distance. These wretched rulers dare to say, We are assafe in this city as flesh in a boiling pot; the walls of the cityshall be to us as walls of brass, we shall receive no more damage fromthe besiegers than the caldron does from the fire. When sinners flatterthemselves to their own ruin, it is time to tell them they shall haveno peace if they go on. None shall remain in possession of the city butthose who are buried in it. Those are least safe who are most secure.God is often pleased to single out some sinners for warning to others.Whether Pelatiah died at that time in Jerusalem, or when the fulfilmentof the prophecy drew near, is uncertain. Like Ezekiel, we ought to bemuch affected with the sudden death of others, and we should stillplead with the Lord to have mercy on those who remain.<br>Ezek. 11:14-21 The pious captives in Babylon were insulted by the Jewswho continued in Jerusalem; but God made gracious promises to them. Itis promised, that God will give them one heart; a heart firmly fixedfor God, and not wavering. All who are made holy have a new spirit, anew temper and dispositions; they act from new principles, walk by newrules, and aim at new ends. A new name, or a new face, will not servewithout a new spirit. If any man be in Christ, he is a new creature.The carnal heart, like a stone, cannot be made to feel. Men live amongthe dead and dying, and are neither concerned nor humbled. He will maketheir hearts tender and fit to receive impressions: this is God's work,it is his gift by promise; and a wonderful and happy change is wroughtby it, from death to life. Their practices shall be agreeable to thoseprinciples. These two must and will go together. When the sinner feelshis need of these blessings, let him present the promises as prayers inthe name of Christ, they will be performed.<br>Ezek. 11:22-25 Here is the departure of God's presence from the cityand temple. It was from the Mount of Olives that the vision went up,typifying the ascension of Christ to heaven from that very mountain.Though the Lord will not forsake his people, yet he may be driven awayfrom any part of his visible church by their sins, and woe will be uponthem when He withdraws his presence, glory, and protection.
Eze 12:	<b>Overview</b><br>The approaching captivity. (Ezek. 12:1-16) An emblem of theconsternation of the Jews. (Ezek. 12:17-20) Answers to the objectionsof scoffers. (Ezek. 12:21-28)<br>Ezek. 12:1-16 By the preparation for removal, and his breaking throughthe wall of his house at evening, as one desirous to escape from theenemy, the prophet signified the conduct and fate of Zedekiah. When Godhas delivered us, we must glorify him and edify others, byacknowledging our sins. Those who by afflictions are brought to this,are made to know that God is the Lord, and may help to bring others toknow him.<br>Ezek. 12:17-20 The prophet must eat and drink in care and fear, withtrembling, that he might express the condition of those in Jerusalemduring the siege. When ministers speak of the ruin coming upon sinners,they must speak as those that know the terrors of the Lord. Afflictionsare happy ones, however grievous to flesh and blood, that improve us inthe knowledge of God.<br>Ezek. 12:21-28 From that forbearance of God, which should have led themto repent, the Jews hardened themselves in sin. It will not serve foran excuse in speaking evil, to plead that it is a common saying. Thereis but a step between us and an awful eternity; therefore it concernsus to get ready for a future state. No one will be able to put fromhimself the evil day, unless by seeking peace with the Lord.
Eze 13:	<b>Overview</b><br>Heavy judgments against lying prophets. (Ezek. 13:1-9) Theinsufficiency of their work. (Ezek. 13:10-16) Woes against falseprophetesses. (Ezek. 13:17-23)<br>Ezek. 13:1-9 Where God gives a warrant to do any thing, he giveswisdom. What they delivered was not what they had seen or heard, asthat is which the ministers of Christ deliver. They were not prayingprophets, had no intercourse with Heaven; they contrived how to pleasepeople, not how to do them good; they stood not against sin. Theyflattered people into vain hopes. Such widen the breach, by causing mento think themselves deserving of eternal life, when the wrath of Godabides upon them.<br>Ezek. 13:10-16 One false prophet built the wall, set up the notion thatJerusalem should be victorious, and made himself acceptable by it.Others made the matter yet more plausible and promising; they daubedthe wall which the first had built; but they would, ere long, beundeceived when their work was beaten down by the storm of God's justwrath; when the Chaldean army desolated the land. Hopes of peace andhappiness, not warranted by the word of God, will cheat men; like awall well daubed, but ill built.<br>Ezek. 13:17-23 It is ill with those who had rather hear pleasing liesthan unpleasing truths. The false prophetesses tried to make peoplesecure, signified by laying them at ease, and to make them proud,signified by the finery laid on their heads. They shall be confoundedin their attempts, and God's people shall be delivered out of theirhands. It behoves Christians to keep close to the word of God, and inevery thing to seek the teaching of the Holy Spirit. Let us so trustthe promises of God as to keep his commandments.
Eze 14:	<b>Overview</b><br>Threatenings against hypocrites. (Ezek. 14:1-11) God's purpose topunish the guilty Jews, but a few should be saved. (Ezek. 14:12-23)<br>Ezek. 14:1-11 No outward form or reformation can be acceptable to God,so long as any idol possesses the heart; yet how many prefer their owndevices and their own righteousness, to the way of salvation! Men'scorruptions are idols in their hearts, and are of their own setting up;God will let them take their course. Sin renders the sinner odious inthe eyes of the pure and holy God; and in his own eyes also, wheneverconscience is awakened. Let us seek to be cleansed from the guilt andpollution of sins, in that fountain which the Lord has opened.<br>Ezek. 14:12-23 National sins bring national judgments. Though sinnersescape one judgment, another is waiting for them. When God's professingpeople rebel against him, they may justly expect all his judgments. Thefaith, obedience, and prayers of Noah prevailed to the saving of hishouse, but not of the old world. Job's sacrifice and prayer in behalfof his friends were accepted, and Daniel had prevailed for the savinghis companions and the wise men of Babylon. But a people that hadfilled the measure of their sins, was not to expect to escape for thesake of any righteous men living among them; not even of the mosteminent saints, who could be accepted in their own case only throughthe sufferings and righteousness of Christ. Yet even when God makes thegreatest desolations by his judgments, he saves some to be monuments ofhis mercy. In firm belief that we shall approve the whole of God'sdealings with ourselves, and with all mankind, let us silence allrebellious murmurs and objections.
Eze 15:	<b>Overview</b><br>Jerusalem like an unfruitful vine.<br>If a vine be fruitful, it is valuable. But if not fruitful, it isworthless and useless, it is cast into the fire. Thus man is capable ofyielding a precious fruit, in living to God; this is the sole end ofhis existence; and if he fails in this, he is of no use but to bedestroyed. What blindness then attaches to those who live in the totalneglect of God and of true religion! This similitude is applied toJerusalem. Let us beware of an unfruitful profession. Let us come toChrist, and seek to abide in him, and to have his words abide in us.
Eze 16:	<b>Overview</b><br>A parable showing the first low estate of the Jewish nation, itsprosperity, idolatries, and punishment.<br>Ezek. 16:1-58 In this chapter God's dealings with the Jewish nation,and their conduct towards him, are described, and their punishmentthrough the surrounding nations, even those they most trusted in. Thisis done under the parable of an exposed infant rescued from death,educated, espoused, and richly provided for, but afterwards guilty ofthe most abandoned conduct, and punished for it; yet at last receivedinto favour, and ashamed of her base conduct. We are not to judge ofthese expressions by modern ideas, but by those of the times and placesin which they were used, where many of them would not sound as they doto us. The design was to raise hatred to idolatry, and such a parablewas well suited for that purpose.<br>Ezek. 16:59-63 After a full warning of judgments, mercy is remembered,mercy is reserved. These closing verses are a precious promise, in partfulfilled at the return of the penitent and reformed Jews out ofBabylon, but to have fuller accomplishment in gospel times. The Divinemercy should be powerful to melt our hearts into godly sorrow for sin.Nor will God ever leave the sinner to perish, who is humbled for hissins, and comes to trust in His mercy and grace through Jesus Christ;but will keep him by his power, through faith unto salvation.
Eze 17:	<b>Overview</b><br>A parable relative to the Jewish nation. (Ezek. 17:1-10) to which anexplanation is added. (Ezek. 17:11-21) A direct promise of the Messiah.(Ezek. 17:22-24)<br>Ezek. 17:1-10 Mighty conquerors are aptly likened to birds or beasts ofprey, but their destructive passions are overruled to forward God'sdesigns. Those who depart from God, only vary their crimes by changingone carnal confidence for another, and never will prosper.<br>Ezek. 17:11-21 The parable is explained, and the particulars of thehistory of the Jewish nation at that time may be traced. Zedekiah hadbeen ungrateful to his benefactor, which is a sin against God. In everysolemn oath, God is appealed to as a witness of the sincerity of himthat swears. Truth is a debt owing to all men. If the professors of thetrue religion deal treacherously with those of a false religion, theirprofession makes their sin the worse; and God will the more surely andseverely punish it. The Lord will not hold those guiltless who take hisname in vain; and no man shall escape the righteous judgment of God whodies under unrepented guilt.<br>Ezek. 17:22-24 The unbelief of man shall not make the promise of God ofnone effect. The parable of a tree, used in the threatening, is herepresented in the promise. It appears only applicable to Jesus, the Sonof David, the Messiah of God. The kingdom of Satan, which has borne solong, so large a sway, shall be broken, and the kingdom of Christ,which was looked upon with contempt, shall be established. Blessed beGod, our Redeemer is seen even by the ends of the earth. We may findrefuge from the wrath to come, and from every enemy and danger, underhis shadow; and believers are fruitful in him.
Eze 18:	<b>Overview</b><br>God has no respect of persons. (Ezek. 18:1-20) The Divine providence isvindicated. (Ezek. 18:21-29) A gracious invitation to repentance.(Ezek. 18:30-32)<br>Ezek. 18:1-20 The soul that sinneth it shall die. As to eternity, everyman was, is, and will be dealt with, as his conduct shows him to havebeen under the old covenant of works, or the new covenant of grace.Whatever outward sufferings come upon men through the sins of others,they deserve for their own sins all they suffer; and the Lord overrulesevery event for the eternal good of believers. All souls are in thehand of the great Creator: he will deal with them in justice or mercy;nor will any perish for the sins of another, who is not in some senseworthy of death for his own. We all have sinned, and our souls must belost, if God deal with us according to his holy law; but we are invitedto come to Christ. If a man who had shown his faith by his works, had awicked son, whose character and conduct were the reverse of hisparent's, could it be expected he should escape the Divine vengeance onaccount of his father's piety? Surely not. And should a wicked man havea son who walked before God as righteous, this man would not perish forhis father's sins. If the son was not free from evils in this life,still he should be partaker of salvation. The question here is notabout the meritorious ground of justification, but about the Lord'sdealings with the righteous and the wicked.<br>Ezek. 18:21-29 The wicked man would be saved, if he turned from hisevil ways. The true penitent is a true believer. None of his formertransgressions shall be mentioned unto him, but in the righteousnesswhich he has done, as the fruit of faith and the effect of conversion,he shall surely live. The question is not whether the truly righteousever become apostates. It is certain that many who for a time werethought to be righteous, do so, while Ezek. 18:26,27 speaks the fulnessof pardoning mercy: when sin is forgiven, it is blotted out, it isremembered no more. In their righteousness they shall live; not fortheir righteousness, as if that were an atonement for their sins, butin their righteousness, which is one of the blessings purchased by theMediator. What encouragement a repenting, returning sinner has to hopefor pardon and life according to this promise! In verse 28 is thebeginning and progress of repentance. True believers watch and pray,and continue to the end, and they are saved. In all our disputes withGod, he is in the right, and we are in the wrong.<br>Ezek. 18:30-32 The Lord will judge each of the Israelites according tohis ways. On this is grounded an exhortation to repent, and to makethem a new heart and a new spirit. God does not command what cannot bedone, but admonishes us to do what is in our power, and to pray forwhat is not. Ordinances and means are appointed, directions andpromises are given, that those who desire this change may seek it fromGod.
Eze 19:	<b>Overview</b><br>A parable lamenting the ruin of Jehoahaz and Jehoiakim. (Ezek. 19:1-9)Another describing the desolation of the people. (Ezek. 19:10-14)<br>Ezek. 19:1-9 Ezekiel is to compare the kingdom of Judah to a lioness.He must compare the kings of Judah to a lion's whelps; they were crueland oppressive to their own subjects. The righteousness of God is to beacknowledged, when those who have terrified and enslaved others, arethemselves terrified and enslaved. When professors of religion formconnexions with ungodly persons, their children usually grow upfollowing after the maxims and fashions of a wicked world. Advancementto authority discovers the ambition and selfishness of men's hearts;and those who spend their lives in mischief, generally end them byviolence.<br>Ezek. 19:10-14 Jerusalem was a vine, flourishing and fruitful. Thisvine is now destroyed, though not plucked up by the roots. She has bywickedness made herself like tinder to the sparks of God's wrath, sothat her own branches serve as fuel to burn her. Blessed be God, oneBranch of the vine here alluded to, is not only become a strong rod forthe sceptre of those that rule, but is Himself the true and livingVine. This shall be for a rejoicing to all the chosen people of Godthroughout all generations.
Eze 20:	<b>Overview</b><br>The elders of Israel are reminded of the idolatry in Egypt. (Ezek.20:1-9) In the wilderness. (Ezek. 20:10-26) In Canaan. (Ezek. 20:27-32)God promises to pardon and restore them. (Ezek. 20:33-44) Prophecyagainst Jerusalem. (Ezek. 20:45-49)<br>Ezek. 20:1-9. Those hearts are wretchedly hardened which ask God leaveto go on in sin, and that even when suffering for it; see Ezek. 20:32.God is justly angry with those who are resolved to go on still in theirtrespasses. Cause the people to know the evil deeds of their fathers,that they may see how righteous it was with God to cut them off.<br>Ezek. 20:10-26. The history of Israel in the wilderness is referred toin the new Testament as well as in the Old, for warning. God did greatthings for them. He gave them the law, and revived the ancient keepingof the sabbath day. Sabbaths are privileges; they are signs of ourbeing his people. If we do the duty of the day, we shall find, to ourcomfort, it is the Lord that makes us holy, that is, truly happy, here;and prepares us to be happy, that is, perfectly holy, hereafter. TheIsraelites rebelled, and were left to the judgments they brought uponthemselves. God sometimes makes sin to be its own punishment, yet he isnot the Author of sin: there needs no more to make men miserable, thanto give them up to their own evil desires and passions.<br>Ezek. 20:27-32 The Jews persisted in rebellion after they settled inthe land of Canaan. And these elders seem to have thought of unitingwith the heathen. We make nothing by our profession if it be but aprofession. There is nothing got by sinful compliances; and the carnalprojects of hypocrites will stand them in no stead.<br>Ezek. 20:33-44 The wicked Israelites, notwithstanding they follow thesinful ways of other nations, shall not mingle with them in theirprosperity, but shall be separated from them for destruction. There isno shaking off God's dominion; and those who will not yield to thepower of his grace, shall sink under the power of his wrath. But notone of God's jewels shall be lost in the lumber of this world. He willbring the jews to the land of Israel again; and will give them truerepentance. They will be overcome with his kindness: the more we knowof God's holiness, the more we see the hateful nature of sin. Those whoremain unaffected amidst means of grace, and would live without Christ,like the world around them, may be sure it is the way to destruction.<br>Ezek. 20:45-49 Judah and Jerusalem had been full of people, as a forestof trees, but empty of fruit. God's word prophesies against those whobring not forth the fruits of righteousness. When He will ruin anation, who or what can save it? The plainest truths were as parablesto the people. It is common for those who will not be wrought upon bythe word, to blame it.
Eze 21:	<b>Overview</b><br>The ruin of Judah under the emblem of a sharp sword. (Ezek. 21:1-17)The approach of the king of Babylon described. (Ezek. 21:18-27) Thedestruction of the Ammonites. (Ezek. 21:28-32)<br>Ezek. 21:1-17 Here is an explanation of the parable in the lastchapter. It is declared that the Lord was about to cut off Jerusalemand the whole land, that all might know it was his decree against awicked and rebellious people. It behoves those who denounce the awfulwrath of God against sinners, to show that they do not desire the wofulday. The example of Christ teaches us to lament over those whose ruinwe declare. Whatever instruments God uses in executing his judgments,he will strengthen them according to the service they are employed in.The sword glitters to the terror of those against whom it is drawn. Itis a sword to others, a rod to the people of the Lord. God is inearnest in pronouncing this sentence, and the prophet must show himselfin earnest in publishing it.<br>Ezek. 21:18-27 By the Spirit of prophecy Ezekiel foresawNebuchadnezzar's march from Babylon, which he would determine bydivination. The Lord would overturn the government of Judah, till thecoming of Him whose right it is. This seems to foretell theoverturnings of the Jewish nation to the present day, and the troublesof states and kingdoms, which shall make way for establishing theMessiah's kingdom throughout the earth. The Lord secretly leads all toadopt his wise designs. And in the midst of the most tremendouswarnings of wrath, we still hear of mercy, and some mention of Himthrough whom mercy is shown to sinful men.<br>Ezek. 21:28-32 The diviners of the Ammonites made false prophecies ofvictory. They would never recover their power, but in time would bewholly forgotten. Let us be thankful to be employed as instruments ofmercy; let us use our understandings in doing good; and let us standaloof from men who are only skilful to destroy.
Eze 22:	<b>Overview</b><br>The sins of Jerusalem. (Ezek. 22:1-16) Israel is condemned as dross.(Ezek. 22:17-22) As the corruption is general, so shall be thepunishment. (Ezek. 22:23-31)<br>Ezek. 22:1-16 The prophet is to judge the bloody city; the city ofbloods. Jerusalem is so called, because of her crimes. The sins whichJerusalem stands charged with, are exceeding sinful. Murder, idolatry,disobedience to parents, oppression and extortion, profanation of thesabbath and holy things, seventh commandment sins, lewdness andadultery. Unmindfulness of God was at the bottom of all thiswickedness. Sinners provoke God because they forget him. Jerusalem hasfilled the measure of her sins. Those who give up themselves to beruled by their lusts, will justly be given up to be portioned by them.Those who resolve to be their own masters, let them expect no otherhappiness than their own hands can furnish; and a miserable portion itwill prove.<br>Ezek. 22:17-22 Israel, compared with other nations, had been as thegold and silver compared with baser metals. But they were now as therefuse that is consumed in the furnace, or thrown away when the silveris refined. Sinners, especially backsliding professors, are, in God'saccount, useless and fit for nothing. When God brings his own peopleinto the furnace, he sits by them as the refiner by his gold, to seethat they are not continued there any longer than is fitting andneedful. The dross shall be wholly separated, and the good metalpurified. Let those who suffer pains, or lingering sickness, and findthat their hearts can scarcely bear these light and momentaryafflictions, take warning to flee from the wrath to come; for if thesetrials are not sanctified by the power of the Holy Spirit, to thecleansing their hearts and hands from sin, far worse things will comeupon them.<br>Ezek. 22:23-31 All orders and degrees of men had helped to fill themeasure of the nation's guilt. The people that had any power abused it,and even the buyers and sellers find some way to oppress one another.It bodes ill to a people when judgments are breaking in upon them, andthe spirit of prayer is restrained. Let all who fear God, unite topromote his truth and righteousness; as wicked men of every rank andprofession plot together to run them down.
Eze 23:	<b>Overview</b><br>A history of the apostacy of God's people from him, and the aggravationthereof.<br>In this parable, Samaria and Israel bear the name Aholah, "her owntabernacle;" because the places of worship those kingdoms had, were oftheir own devising. Jerusalem and Judah bear the name of Aholibah, "mytabernacle is in her," because their temple was the place which Godhimself had chosen, to put his name there. The language and figures areaccording to those times. Will not such humbling representations ofnature keep open perpetual repentance and sorrow in the soul, hidingpride from our eyes, and taking us from self-righteousness? Will it notalso prompt the soul to look to God continually for grace, that by hisHoly Spirit we may mortify the deeds of the body, and live in holyconversation and godliness?
Eze 24:	<b>Overview</b><br>The fate of Jerusalem. (Ezek. 24:1-14) The extent of the sufferings ofthe Jews. (Ezek. 24:15-27)<br>Ezek. 24:1-14 The pot on the fire represented Jerusalem besieged by theChaldeans: all orders and ranks were within the walls, prepared as aprey for the enemy. They ought to have put away their transgressions,as the scum, which rises by the heat of the fire, is taken from the topof the pot. But they grew worse, and their miseries increased.Jerusalem was to be levelled with the ground. The time appointed forthe punishment of wicked men may seem to come slowly, but it will comesurely. It is sad to think how many there are, on whom ordinances andprovidences are all lost.<br>Ezek. 24:15-27 Though mourning for the dead is a duty, yet it must bekept under by religion and right reason: we must not sorrow as men thathave no hope. Believers must not copy the language and expressions ofthose who know not God. The people asked the meaning of the sign. Godtakes from them all that was dearest to them. And as Ezekiel wept notfor his affliction, so neither should they weep for theirs. Blessed beGod, we need not pine away under our afflictions; for should allcomforts fail, and all sorrows be united, yet the broken heart and themourner's prayer are always acceptable before God.
Eze 25:	<b>Overview</b><br>Judgments against the Ammonites. (Ezek. 25:1-7) Against the Moabites,Edomites, and Philistines. (Ezek. 25:8-17)<br>Ezek. 25:1-7. It is wicked to be glad at the calamities of any,especially of God's people; it is a sin for which he will surelyreckon. God will make it appear that he is the God of Israel, though hesuffers them for a time to be captives in Babylon. It is better to knowHim, and to be poor, than to be rich and ignorant of him.<br>Ezek. 25:8-17 Though one event seem to the righteous and wicked, it isvastly different. Those who glory in any other defence and protectionthan the Divine power, providence, and promise, will, sooner or later,be ashamed of their glorying. Those who will not leave it to God totake vengeance for them, may expect that he will take vengeance onthem. The equity of the Lord's judgments is to be observed, when he notonly avenges injuries upon those that did them, but by those againstwhom they were done. Those who treasure up old hatred, and watch forthe opportunity of manifesting it, are treasuring up for themselveswrath against the day of wrath.
Eze 26:	<b>Overview</b><br>A prophecy against Tyre.<br>Ezek. 26:1-14 To be secretly pleased with the death or decay of others,when we are likely to get by it; or with their fall, when we may thriveupon it, is a sin that easily besets us, yet is not thought so bad asreally it is. But it comes from a selfish, covetous principle, and fromthat love of the world as our happiness, which the love of Godexpressly forbids. He often blasts the projects of those who wouldraise themselves on the ruin of others. The maxims most current in thetrading world, are directly opposed to the law of God. But he will showhimself against the money-loving, selfish traders, whose hearts, likethose of Tyre, are hardened by the love of riches. Men have littlecause to glory in things which stir up the envy and rapacity of others,and which are continually shifting from one to another; and in getting,keeping, and spending which, men provoke that God whose wrath turnsjoyous cities into ruinous heaps.<br>Ezek. 26:15-21 See how high, how great Tyre had been. See how low Tyreis made. The fall of others should awaken us out of security. Everydiscovery of the fulfilment of a Scripture prophecy, is like a miracleto confirm our faith. All that is earthly is vanity and vexation. Thosewho now have the most established prosperity, will soon be out of sightand forgotten.
Eze 27:	<b>Overview</b><br>The merchandise of Tyre. (Ezek. 27:1-25) Its fall and ruin. (Ezek.27:26-36)<br>Ezek. 27:1-25 Those who live at ease are to be lamented, if they arenot prepared for trouble. Let none reckon themselves beautified, anyfurther than they are sanctified. The account of the trade of Tyreintimates, that God's eye is upon men when employed in worldlybusiness. Not only when at church, praying and hearing, but when inmarkets and fairs, buying and selling. In all our dealings we shouldkeep a conscience void of offence. God, as the common Father ofmankind, makes one country abound in one commodity, and another inanother, serviceable to the necessity or to the comfort and ornament ofhuman life. See what a blessing trade and merchandise are to mankind,when followed in the fear of God. Besides necessaries, an abundance ofthings are made valuable only by custom; yet God allows us to use them.But when riches increase, men are apt to set their hearts upon them,and forget the Lord, who gives power to get wealth.<br>Ezek. 27:26-36 The most mighty and magnificent kingdoms and states,sooner or later, come down. Those who make creatures their confidence,and rest their hopes upon them, will fall with them: happy are thosewho have the God of Jacob for their Help, and whose hope is in the Lordtheir God, who lives for ever. Those who engage in trade should learnto conduct their business according to God's word. Those who possesswealth should remember they are the Lord's stewards, and should use hisgoods in doing good to all. Let us seek first the kingdom of God andhis righteousness.
Eze 28:	<b>Overview</b><br>The sentence against the prince or king of Tyre. (Ezek. 28:1-19) Thefall of Zidon. (Ezek. 28:20-23) The restoration of Israel. (Ezek.28:24-26)<br>Ezek. 28:1-19 Ethbaal, or Ithobal, was the prince or king of Tyre; andbeing lifted up with excessive pride, he claimed Divine honours. Prideis peculiarly the sin of our fallen nature. Nor can any wisdom, exceptthat which the Lord gives, lead to happiness in this world or in thatwhich is to come. The haughty prince of Tyre thought he was able toprotect his people by his own power, and considered himself as equal tothe inhabitants of heaven. If it were possible to dwell in the gardenof Eden, or even to enter heaven, no solid happiness could be enjoyedwithout a humble, holy, and spiritual mind. Especially all spiritualpride is of the devil. Those who indulge therein must expect to perish.<br>Ezek. 28:20-26. The Zidonians were borderers upon the land of Israel,and they might have learned to glorify the Lord; but, instead of that,they seduced Israel to the worship of their idols. War and pestilenceare God's messengers; but he will be glorified in the restoring hispeople to their former safety and prosperity. God will cure them oftheir sins, and ease them of their troubles. This promise will atlength fully come to pass in the heavenly Canaan: when all the saintsshall be gathered together, every thing that offends shall be removed,all griefs and fears for ever banished. Happy, then, is the church ofGod, and every living member of it, though poor, afflicted, anddespised; for the Lord will display his truth, power, and mercy, in thesalvation and happiness of his redeemed people.
Eze 29:	<b>Overview</b><br>The desolation of Egypt. (Ezek. 29:1-16) Also a promise of mercy toIsrael. (Ezek. 29:17-21)<br>Ezek. 29:1-16 Worldly, carnal minds pride themselves in their property,forgetting that whatever we have, we received it from God, and shoulduse it for God. Why, then, do we boast? Self is the great idol whichall the world worships, in contempt of God and his sovereignty. God canforce men out of that in which they are most secure and easy. Such aone, and all that cleave to him, shall perish together. Thus end men'spride, presumption, and carnal security. The Lord is against those whodo harm to his people, and still more against those who lead them intosin. Egypt shall be a kingdom again, but it shall be the basest of thekingdoms; it shall have little wealth and power. History shows thecomplete fulfilment of this prophecy. God, not only in justice, but inwisdom and goodness to us, breaks the creature-stays on which we lean,that they may be no more our confidence.<br>Ezek. 29:17-21 The besiegers of Tyre obtained little plunder. But whenGod employs ambitious or covetous men, he will recompense themaccording to the desires of their hearts; for every man shall have hisreward. God had mercy in store for the house of Israel soon after. Thehistory of nations best explains ancient prophecies. All events fulfilthe Scriptures. Thus, in the deepest scenes of adversity, the Lord sowsthe seed of our future prosperity. Happy are those who desire hisfavour, grace, and image; they will delight in his service, and notcovet any earthly recompence; and the blessings they have chosen shallbe sure to them for ever.
Eze 30:	<b>Overview</b><br>A prophecy against Egypt. (Ezek. 30:1-19) Another. (Ezek. 30:20-26)<br>Ezek. 30:1-19 The prophecy of the destruction of Egypt is very full.Those who take their lot with God's enemies, shall be with them inpunishment. The king of Babylon and his army shall be instruments ofthis destruction. God often makes one wicked man a scourge to another.No place in the land of Egypt shall escape the fury of the Chaldeans.The Lord is known by the judgments he executes. Yet these are onlypresent effects of the Divine displeasure, not worthy of our fear,compared with the wrath to come, from which Jesus delivers his people.<br>Ezek. 30:20-26 Egypt shall grow weaker and weaker. If lesser judgmentsdo not prevail to humble and reform sinners, God will send greater. Godjustly breaks that power which is abused, either to put wrongs uponpeople, or to put cheats upon them. Babylon shall grow stronger. Invain do men endeavour to bind up the arm the Lord is pleased to break,and to strengthen those whom he will bring down. Those who disregardthe discoveries of his truth and mercy, shall know his power andjustice, in the punishment for their sins.
Eze 31:	<b>Overview</b><br>The glory of Assyria. (Ezek. 31:1-9) Its fall, and the like for Egypt.(Ezek. 31:10-18)<br>Ezek. 31:1-9 The falls of others, both into sin and ruin, warn us notto be secure or high-minded. The prophet is to show an instance of onewhom the king of Egypt resembled in greatness, the Assyrian, comparedto a stately cedar. Those who excel others, make themselves the objectsof envy; but the blessings of the heavenly paradise are not liable tosuch alloy. The utmost security that any creature can give, is but likethe shadow of a tree, a scanty and slender protection. But let us fleeto God for protection, there we shall be safe. His hand must be ownedin the rising of the great men of the earth, and we must not envy them.Though worldly people may seem to have firm prosperity, yet it onlyseems so.<br>Ezek. 31:10-18 The king of Egypt resembled the king of Assyria in hisgreatness: here we see he resembles him in his pride. And he shallresemble him in his fall. His own sin brings his ruin. None of ourcomforts are ever lost, but what have been a thousand times forfeited.When great men fall, many fall with them, as many have fallen beforethem. The fall of proud men is for warning to others, to keep themhumble. See how low Pharaoh lies; and see what all his pomp and prideare come to. It is best to be a lowly tree of righteousness, yieldingfruit to the glory of God, and to the good of men. The wicked man isoften seen flourishing like the cedar, and spreading like the green baytree, but he soon passes away, and his place is no more found. Let usthen mark the perfect man, and behold the upright, for the end of thatman is peace.
Eze 32:	<b>Overview</b><br>The fall of Egypt. (Ezek. 32:1-16) It is like that of other nations.(Ezek. 32:17-32)<br>Ezek. 32:1-16 It becomes us to weep and tremble for those who will notweep and tremble for themselves. Great oppressors are, in God'saccount, no better than beasts of prey. Those who admire the pomp ofthis world, will wonder at the ruin of that pomp; which to those whoknow the vanity of all things here below, is no surprise. When othersare ruined by sin, we have to fear, knowing ourselves guilty. Theinstruments of the desolation are formidable. And the instances of thedesolation are frightful. The waters of Egypt shall run like oil, whichsignifies there should be universal sadness and heaviness upon thewhole nation. God can soon empty those of this world's goods who havethe greatest fulness of them. By enlarging the matters of our joy, weincrease the occasions of our sorrow. How weak and helpless, as to God,are the most powerful of mankind! The destruction of Egypt was a typeof the destruction of the enemies of Christ.<br>Ezek. 32:17-32 Divers nations are mentioned as gone down to the gravebefore Egypt, who are ready to give her a scornful reception; thesenations had been lately ruined and wasted. But though Judah andJerusalem were about this time ruined and laid waste, yet they are notmentioned here. Though they suffered the same affliction, and by thesame hand, yet the kind design for which they were afflicted, and themercy God reserved for them, altered its nature. It was not to them agoing down to the pit, as it was to the heathen. Pharaoh shall see, andbe comforted; but the comfort wicked ones have after death, is poorcomfort, not real, but only in fancy. The view this prophecy gives ofruined states shows something of this present world, and the empire ofdeath in it. Come and see the calamitous state of human life. As if mendid not die fast enough, they are ingenious at finding out ways todestroy one another. Also of the other world; though the destruction ofnations as such, seems chiefly intended, here is plain allusion to theeverlasting ruin of impenitent sinners. How are men deceived by Satan!What are the objects they pursue through scenes of bloodshed, and theirmany sins? Surely man disquiets himself in vain, whether he pursueswealth, fame, power, or pleasure. The hour cometh, when all that are intheir graves shall hear the voice of Christ, and shall come forth;those that have done good to the resurrection of life, and those thathave done evil to the resurrection of damnation.
Eze 33:	<b>Overview</b><br>Ezekiel's duty as a watchman. (Ezek. 33:1-9) He is to vindicate theDivine government. (Ezek. 33:10-20) The desolation of Judea. (Ezek.33:21-29) Judgments on the mockers of the prophets. (Ezek. 33:30-33)<br>Ezek. 33:1-9 The prophet is a watchman to the house of Israel. Hisbusiness is to warn sinners of their misery and danger. He must warnthe wicked to turn from their way, that they may live. If souls perishthrough his neglect of duty, he brings guilt upon himself. See whatthose have to answer for, who make excuses for sin, flatter sinners,and encourage them to believe they shall have peace, though they go on.How much wiser are men in their temporal than in their spiritualconcerns! They set watchmen to guard their houses, and sentinels towarn of the enemies' approach, but where the everlasting happiness ormisery of the soul is at stake, they are offended if ministers obeytheir Master's command, and give a faithful warning; they would ratherperish, listening to smooth things.<br>Ezek. 33:10-20 Those who despaired of finding mercy with God, areanswered with a solemn declaration of God's readiness to show mercy.The ruin of the city and state was determined, but that did not relateto the final state of persons. God says to the righteous, that he shallsurely live. But many who have made profession, have been ruined byproud confidence in themselves. Man trusts to his own righteousness,and presuming on his own sufficiency, he is brought to commit iniquity.If those who have lived a wicked life repent and forsake their wickedways, they shall be saved. Many such amazing and blessed changes havebeen wrought by the power of Divine grace. When there is a settledseparation between a man and sin, there shall no longer be a separationbetween him and God.<br>Ezek. 33:21-29 Those are unteachable indeed, who do not learn theirdependence upon God, when all creature-comforts fail. Many claim aninterest in the peculiar blessings to true believers, while theirconduct proves them enemies of God. They call this groundlesspresumption strong faith, when God's testimony declares them entitledto his threatenings, and nothing else.<br>Ezek. 33:30-33 Unworthy and corrupt motives often lead men to theplaces where the word of God is faithfully preached. Many come to findsomewhat to oppose: far more come of curiosity or mere habit. Men mayhave their hearts changed. But whether men hear or forbear, they willknow by the event that a servant of God has been among them. All whowill not know the worth of mercies by the improvement of them, willjustly be made to know their worth by the want of them.
Eze 34:	<b>Overview</b><br>The rulers reproved. (Ezek. 34:1-6) The people are to be restored totheir own land. (Ezek. 34:7-16) The kingdom of Christ. (Ezek. 34:17-31)<br>Ezek. 34:1-6 The people became as sheep without a shepherd, were givenup as a prey to their enemies, and the land was utterly desolated. Norank or office can exempt from the reproofs of God's word, men whoneglect their duty, and abuse the trust reposed in them.<br>Ezek. 34:7-16 The Lord declared that he intended mercy towards thescattered flock. Doubtless this, in the first place, had reference tothe restoration of the Jews. It also represented the good Shepherd'stender care of the souls of his people. He finds them in their days ofdarkness and ignorance, and brings them to his fold. He comes to theirrelief in times of persecution and temptation. He leads them in theways of righteousness, and causes them to rest on his love andfaithfulness. The proud and self-sufficient, are enemies of the truegospel and of believers; against such we must guard. He has rest fordisquieted saints, and terror for presumptuous sinners.<br>Ezek. 34:17-31 The whole nation seemed to be the Lord's flock, yet theywere very different characters; but he knew how to distinguish betweenthem. By good pastures and deep waters, are meant the pure word of Godand the dispensing of justice. The latter verses, 23-31, prophesy ofChrist, and of the most glorious times of his church on earth. UnderHim, as the good Shepherd, the church would be a blessing to allaround. Christ, though excellent in himself, was as a tender plant outof a dry ground. Being the Tree of life, bearing all the fruits ofsalvation, he yields spiritual food to the souls of his people. Ourconstant desire and prayer should be, that there may be showers ofblessings in every place where the truth of Christ is preached; andthat all who profess the gospel may be filled with fruits ofrighteousness.
Eze 35:	<b>Overview</b><br>A prophecy against Edom.<br>Ezek. 35:1-9 All who have God against them, have the word of Godagainst them. Those that have a constant hatred to God and his people,as the carnal mind has, can only expect to be made desolate for ever.<br>Ezek. 35:10-15 When we see the vanity of the world in thedisappointments, losses, and crosses, which others meet with, insteadof showing ourselves greedy of worldly things, we should sit more looseto them. In the multitude of words, not one is unknown to God; not themost idle word; and the most daring is not above his rebuke. In thedestruction of the enemies of the church, God designs his own glory;and we may be sure that he will not come short of his design. And whenthe fulness of the Jews and Gentiles shall come into the church, allantichristian opposers shall be destroyed.
Eze 36:	<b>Overview</b><br>The land shall be delivered from heathen oppressors. (Ezek. 36:1-15)The people are reminded of former sins, and promised deliverance.(Ezek. 36:16-24) Also holiness, and gospel blessings. (Ezek. 36:25-38)<br>Ezek. 36:1-15 Those who put contempt and reproach on God's people, willhave them turned on themselves. God promises favour to his Israel. Wehave no reason to complain, if the more unkind men are, the more kindGod is. They shall come again to their own border. It was a type of theheavenly Canaan, of which all God's children are heirs, and into whichthey all shall be brought together. And when God returns in mercy to apeople who return to him in duty, all their grievances will be setright. The full completion of this prophecy must be in some futureevent.<br>Ezek. 36:16-24 The restoration of that people, being typical of ourredemption by Christ, shows that the end aimed at in our salvation isthe glory of God. The sin of a people defiles their land; renders itabominable to God, and uncomfortable to themselves. God's holy name ishis great name; his holiness is his greatness, nor does any thing elsemake a man truly great.<br>Ezek. 36:25-38 Water is an emblem of the cleansing our polluted soulsfrom sin. But no water can do more than take away the filth of theflesh. Water seems in general the sacramental sign of the sanctifyinginfluences of the Holy Ghost; yet this is always connected with theatoning blood of Christ. When the latter is applied by faith to theconscience, to cleanse it from evil works, the former is always appliedto the powers of the soul, to purify it from the pollution of sin. Allthat have an interest in the new covenant, have a new heart and a newspirit, in order to their walking in newness of life. God would give aheart of flesh, a soft and tender heart, complying with his holy will.Renewing grace works as great a change in the soul, as the turning adead stone into living flesh. God will put his Spirit within, as aTeacher, Guide, and Sanctifier. The promise of God's grace to fit usfor our duty, should quicken our constant care and endeavour to do ourduty. These are promises to be pleaded by, and will be fulfilled to,all true believers in every age.
Eze 37:	<b>Overview</b><br>God restores dried bones to life. (Ezek. 37:1-14) The whole house ofIsrael is represented as enjoying the blessings of Christ's kingdom.(Ezek. 37:15-28)<br>Ezek. 37:1-14 No created power could restore human bones to life. Godalone could cause them to live. Skin and flesh covered them, and thewind was then told to blow upon these bodies; and they were restored tolife. The wind was an emblem of the Spirit of God, and represented hisquickening powers. The vision was to encourage the desponding Jews; topredict both their restoration after the captivity, and also theirrecovery from their present and long-continued dispersion. It was alsoa clear intimation of the resurrection of the dead; and it representsthe power and grace of God, in the conversion of the most hopelesssinners to himself. Let us look to Him who will at last open ourgraves, and bring us forth to judgment, that He may now deliver us fromsin, and put his Spirit within us, and keep us by his power, throughfaith, unto salvation.<br>Ezek. 37:15-28 This emblem was to show the people, that the Lord wouldunite Judah and Israel. Christ is the true David, Israel's King of old;and those whom he makes willing in the day of his power, he makes towalk in his judgments, and to keep his statutes. Events yet to comewill further explain this prophecy. Nothing has more hindered thesuccess of the gospel than divisions. Let us study to keep the unity ofthe Spirit in the bond of peace; let us seek for Divine grace to keepus from detestable things; and let us pray that all nations may beobedient and happy subjects of the Son of David, that the Lord may beour God, and we may be his people for evermore.
Eze 38:	<b>Overview</b><br>The army and malice of Gog. (Ezek. 38:1-13) God's judgments. (Ezek.38:14-23)<br>Ezek. 38:1-13 These events will be in the latter days. It is supposedthese enemies will come together to invade the land of Judea, and Godwill defeat them. God not only sees who are now the enemies of hischurch, but he foresees who will be so, and lets them know by his wordthat he is against them; though they join together, the wicked shallnot be unpunished.<br>Ezek. 38:14-23 The enemy should make a formidable descent upon the landof Israel. When Israel dwell safely under the Divine protection, shaltnot thou be made to know it by finding that endeavours to destroy themare made in vain? Promises of security are treasured up in the word ofGod, against the troubles and dangers the church may be brought into inthe latter days. In the destruction of sinners, God makes it appearthat he is a great and holy God. We should desire and pray daily.Father, glorify thine own name.
Eze 39:	<b>Overview</b><br>The destruction of Gog. (Ezek. 39:1-10) Its extent. (Ezek. 39:11-22)Israel again favoured. (Ezek. 39:23-29)<br>Ezek. 39:1-10 The Lord will make the most careless and hardenedtransgressors know his holy name, either by his righteous anger, or bythe riches of his mercy and grace. The weapons formed against Zionshall not prosper. Though this prophecy is to be fulfilled in thelatter days, it is certain. From the language used, it seems that thearmy of Gog will be destroyed by miracle.<br>Ezek. 39:11-22 How numerous the enemies which God destroyed for thedefence of his people Israel! Times of great deliverances should betimes of reformation. Every one should help the utmost he can, towardcleansing the land from reproach. Sin is an enemy every man shouldstrive against. Those engaged in public work, especially of cleansingand reforming a land, ought to be men who will go through with whatthey undertake, who will be always employed. When good work is to bedone, every one should further it. Having received special favours fromGod, let us cleanse ourselves from all evil. It is a work which willrequire persevering diligence, that search may be made into the secretrecesses of sin. The judgments of the Lord, brought upon sin andsinners, are a sacrifice to the justice of God, and a feast to thefaith and hope of God's people. See how evil pursues sinners, evenafter death. After all that ambitious and covetous men do and look for,"a place of graves" is all the Lord gives them on earth, while theirguilty souls are doomed to misery in another world.<br>Ezek. 39:23-29 When the Lord shall have mercy on the whole house ofIsrael, by converting them to Christianity, and when they shall haveborne the shame of being cast off for their sins, then the nationsshall learn to know, worship, and serve him. Then Israel also shallknow the Lord, as revealed in and by Christ. Past events do not answerto these predictions. The pouring out of the Spirit is a pledge thatGod's favour will continue. He will hide his face no more from those onwhom he has poured out his Spirit. When we pray that God would nevercast us from his presence, we must as earnestly pray that, in orderthereto, he would never take his Holy Spirit from us.
Eze 40:	<b>Overview</b><br>The Vision of the Temple.<br>Here is a vision, beginning at Ezek. 40, and continued to the end ofthe book, Ezek. 48, which is justly looked upon to be one of the mostdifficult portions in all the book of God. When we despair to besatisfied as to any difficulty we meet with, let us bless God that oursalvation does not depend upon it, but that things necessary are plainenough; and let us wait till God shall reveal even this unto us. Thischapter describes two outward courts of the temple. Whether thepersonage here mentioned was the Son of God, or a created angel, is notclear. But Christ is both our Altar and our Sacrifice, to whom we mustlook with faith in all approaches to God; and he is Salvation in themidst of the earth, Ps. 74:12, to be looked unto from all quarters.
Eze 41:	<b>Overview</b><br>After the prophet had observed the courts, he was brought to thetemple. If we attend to instructions in the plainer parts of religion,and profit by them, we shall be led further into an acquaintance withthe mysteries of the kingdom of heaven.
Eze 42:	<b>Overview</b><br>In this chapter are described the priests' chambers, their use, and thedimensions of the holy mount on which the temple stood. These chamberswere many. Jesus said, In my Father's house are many mansions: in hishouse on earth there are many; multitudes, by faith, are lodging in hissanctuary, and yet there is room. These chambers, though private, werenear the temple. Our religious services in our chambers, must preparefor public devotions, and further us in improving them, as ouropportunities are.
Eze 43:	<b>Overview</b><br>After Ezekiel had surveyed the temple of God, he had a vision of theglory of God. When Christ crucified, and the things freely given to usof God, through Him, are shown to us by the Holy Ghost, they make usashamed for our sins. This frame of mind prepares us for fullerdiscoveries of the mysteries of redeeming love; and the whole of theScriptures should be opened and applied, that men may see their sins,and repent of them. We are not now to offer any atoning sacrifices, forby one offering Christ has perfected for ever those that aresanctified, Heb. 10:14; but the sprinkling of his blood is needful inall our approaches to God the Father. Our best services can be acceptedonly as sprinkled with the blood which cleanses from all sin.
Eze 44:	<b>Overview</b><br>This chapter contains ordinances relative to the true priests. Theprince evidently means Christ, and the words in Ezek. 44:2, may remindus that no other can enter heaven, the true sanctuary, as Christ did;namely, by virtue of his own excellency, and his personal holiness,righteousness, and strength. He who is the Brightness of Jehovah'sglory entered by his own holiness; but that way is shut to the wholehuman race, and we all must enter as sinners, by faith in his blood,and by the power of his grace.
Eze 45:	<b>Overview</b><br>In the period here foretold, the worship and the ministers of God willbe provided for; the princes will rule with justice, as holding theirpower under Christ; the people will live in peace, ease, and godliness.These things seem to be represented in language taken from the customsof the times in which the prophet wrote. Christ is our Passover that issacrificed for us: we celebrate the memorial of that sacrifice, andfeast upon it, triumphing in our deliverance out of the Egyptianslavery of sin, and our preservation from the destroying sword ofDivine justice, in the Lord's supper, which is our passover feast; asthe whole Christian life is, and must be, the feast of the unleavenedbread of sincerity and truth.
Eze 46:	<b>Overview</b><br>The ordinances of worship for the prince and for the people, are heredescribed, and the gifts the prince may bestow on his sons andservants. Our Lord has directed us to do many duties, but he has alsoleft many things to our choice, that those who delight in hiscommandments may abound therein to his glory, without entangling theirown consciences, or prescribing rules unfit for others; but we mustnever omit our daily worship, nor neglect to apply the sacrifice of theLamb of God to our souls, for pardon, peace, and salvation.
Eze 47:	<b>Overview</b><br>These waters signify the gospel of Christ, which went forth fromJerusalem, and spread into the countries about; also the gifts andpowers of the Holy Ghost which accompanied it, by virtue of which isspread far, and produced blessed effects. Christ is the Temple; and heis the Door; from him the living waters flow, out of his pierced side.They are increasing waters. Observe the progress of the gospel in theworld, and the process of the work of grace in the heart; attend themotions of the blessed Spirit under Divine guidance. If we search intothe things of God, we find some things plain and easy to be understood,as the waters that were but to the ankles; others more difficult, whichrequire a deeper search, as the waters to the knees, or the loins; andsome quite beyond our reach, which we cannot penetrate; but must, asSt. Paul did, adore the depth, Rom. 11. It is wisdom to begin with thatwhich is most easy, before we proceed to that which is dark and hard tobe understood. The promises of the sacred word, and the privileges ofbelievers, as shed abroad in their souls by the quickening Spirit,abound where the gospel is preached; they nourish and delight the soulsof men; they never fade nor wither, nor are exhausted. Even the leavesserve as medicines to the soul: the warnings and reproofs of the word,though less pleasant than Divine consolations, tend to heal thediseases of the soul. All who believe in Christ, and are united to himby his sanctifying Spirit, will share the privileges of Israelites.There is room in the church, and in heaven, for all who seek theblessings of that new covenant of which Christ is Mediator.
Eze 48:	<b>Overview</b><br>Here is a description of the several portions of the land belonging toeach tribe. In gospel times, behold all things are become new. Much iswrapped up in emblems and numbers. This method God has used to statemysterious truths in his word, not to be more clearly revealed till theproper time and season. But into the church of Christ, both in itsstate of warfare and triumph, there is free access by faith, from everyside. Christ has opened the kingdom of heaven for all believers.Whoever will, may come, and take of the water of life, of the tree oflife, freely. The Lord is there, in his church, to be nigh unto them inall they call upon him for. This is true of every real Christian;whatever soul has in it a living principle of grace, it may truly besaid, The Lord is there. May we be found citizens of this holy city,and act agreeably to that character; and have the benefit of the Lord'spresence with us, in life, in death, and for evermore.
Dan 1:	<b>Overview</b><br>The captivity of Daniel and his companions. (Dan. 1:1-7) Their refusalto eat the king's meat. (Dan. 1:8-16) Their improvement in wisdom.(Dan. 1:17-21)<br>Dan. 1:1-7 Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, in the first year of hisreign, took Jerusalem, and carried whom and what he pleased away. Fromthis first captivity, most think the seventy years are to be dated. Itis the interest of princes to employ wise men; and it is their wisdomto find out and train up such. Nebuchadnezzar ordered that these chosenyouths should be taught. All their Hebrew names had something of God inthem; but to make them forget the God of their fathers, the Guide oftheir youth, the heathen gave them names that savoured of idolatry. Itis painful to reflect how often public education tends to corrupt theprinciples and morals.<br>Dan. 1:8-16 The interest we think we make for ourselves, we mustacknowledge to be God's gift. Daniel was still firm to his religion.Whatever they called him, he still held fast the spirit of anIsraelite. These youths scrupled concerning the meat, lest it should besinful. When God's people are in Babylon they need take special carethat they partake not of her sins. It is much to the praise of youngpeople, not to covet or seek the delights of sense. Those who wouldexcel in wisdom and piety, must learn betimes to keep the body under.Daniel avoided defiling himself with sin; and we should more fear thatthan any outward trouble. It is easier to keep temptation at adistance, than to resist it when near. And we cannot better improve ourinterest in any with whom we have found favour, than to use it to keepus from sin. People will not believe the benefit of avoiding excess,and of a spare diet, nor how much they contribute to the health of thebody, unless they try. Conscientious temperance will always do more,even for the comfort of this life, than sinful indulgence.<br>Dan. 1:17-21 Daniel and his fellows kept to their religion; and Godrewarded them with eminence in learning. Pious young persons shouldendeavour to do better than their fellows in useful things; not for thepraise of man, but for the honour of the gospel, and that they may bequalified for usefulness. And it is well for a country, and for thehonour of a prince, when he is able to judge who are best fitted toserve him, and prefers them on that account. Let young men steadilyattend to this chapter; and let all remember that God will honour thosewho honour him, but those who despise him shall be lightly esteemed.
Dan 2:	<b>Overview</b><br>Nebuchadnezzar's dream. (Dan. 2:1-13) It is revealed to Daniel. (Dan.2:14-23) He obtains admission to the king. (Dan. 2:24-30) The dream andthe interpretation. (Dan. 2:31-45) Honours to Daniel and his friends.(Dan. 2:46-49)<br>Dan. 2:1-13 The greatest men are most open to cares and troubles ofmind, which disturb their repose in the night, while the sleep of thelabouring man is sweet and sound. We know not the uneasiness of manywho live in great pomp, and, as others vainly think, in pleasure also.The king said that his learned men must tell him the dream itself, orthey should all be put to death as deceivers. Men are more eager to askas to future events, than to learn the way of salvation or the path ofduty; yet foreknowledge of future events increases anxiety and trouble.Those who deceived, by pretending to do what they could not do, weresentenced to death, for not being able to do what they did not pretendto.<br>Dan. 2:14-23 Daniel humbly prayed that God would discover to him theking's dream, and the meaning of it. Praying friends are valuablefriends; and it well becomes the greatest and best men to desire theprayers of others. Let us show that we value our friends, and theirprayers. They were particular in prayer. And whatever we pray for, wecan expect nothing but as the gift of God's mercies. God gives us leavein prayer to tell our wants and burdens. Their plea with God was, theperil they were in. The mercy Daniel and his fellows prayed for, wasbestowed. The fervent prayers of righteous men avail much. Daniel wasthankful to God for making known that to him, which saved the lives ofhimself and his fellows. How much more should we be thankful to God,for making known the great salvation of the soul to those who are notamong the worldly wise and prudent!<br>Dan. 2:24-30 Daniel takes away the king's opinion of his magicians andsoothsayers. The insufficiency of creatures should drive us to theall-sufficiency of the Creator. There is One who can do that for us,and make known that to us, which none on earth can, particularly thework of redemption, and the secret designs of God's love to us therein.Daniel confirmed the king in his opinion, that the dream was of greatconsequence, relating to the affairs and changes of this lower world.Let those whom God has highly favoured and honoured, lay aside allopinion of their own wisdom and worthiness, that the Lord alone may bepraised for the good they have and do.<br>Dan. 2:31-45 This image represented the kingdoms of the earth, thatshould successively rule the nations, and influence the affairs of theJewish church. 1. The head of gold signified the Chaldean empire, thenin being. 2. The breast and arms of silver signified the empire of theMedes and Persians. 3. The belly and thighs of brass signified theGrecian empire, founded by Alexander. 4. The legs and feet of ironsignified the Roman empire. The Roman empire branched into tenkingdoms, as the toes of these feet. Some were weak as clay, othersstrong as iron. Endeavours have often been used to unite them, forstrengthening the empire, but in vain. The stone cut out without hands,represented the kingdom of our Lord Jesus Christ, which should be setup in the kingdoms of the world, upon the ruins of Satan's kingdom inthem. This was the Stone which the builders refused, because it was notcut out by their hands, but it is become the head stone of the corner.Of the increase of Christ's government and peace there shall be no end.The Lord shall reign, not only to the end of time, but when time anddays shall be no more. As far as events have gone, the fulfilling thisprophetic vision has been most exact and undeniable; future ages shallwitness this Stone destroying the image, and filling the whole earth.<br>Dan. 2:46-49 It is our business to direct attention to the Lord, as theAuthor and Giver of every good gift. Many have thoughts of the Divinepower and majesty, who do not think of serving God themselves. But allshould strive, that God may be glorified, and the best interests ofmankind furthered.
Dan 3:	<b>Overview</b><br>Nebuchadnezzar's golden image. (Dan. 3:1-7) Shadrach and his companionsrefuse to worship it. (Dan. 3:8-18) They are cast into a furnace, butare miraculously preserved. (Dan. 3:19-27) Nebuchadnezzar gives gloryto Jehovah. (Dan. 3:28-30)<br>Dan. 3:1-7 In the height of the image, about thirty yards, probably isincluded a pedestal, and most likely it was only covered with plates ofgold, not a solid mass of that precious metal. Pride and bigotry causemen to require their subjects to follow their religion, whether rightor wrong, and when worldly interest allures, and punishment overawes,few refuse. This is easy to the careless, the sensual, and the infidel,who are the greatest number; and most will go their ways. There isnothing so bad which the careless world will not be drawn to by aconcert of music, or driven to by a fiery furnace. By such methods,false worship has been set up and maintained.<br>Dan. 3:8-18 True devotion calms the spirit, quiets and softens it, butsuperstition and devotion to false gods inflame men's passions. Thematter is put into a little compass, Turn, or burn. Proud men are stillready to say, as Nebuchadnezzar, Who is the Lord, that I should fearhis power? Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego did not hesitate whetherthey should comply or not. Life or death were not to be considered.Those that would avoid sin, must not parley with temptation when thatto which we are allured or affrighted is manifestly evil. Stand not topause about it, but say, as Christ did, Get thee behind me, Satan. Theydid not contrive an evasive answer, when a direct answer was expected.Those who make their duty their main care, need not be anxious orfearful concerning the event. The faithful servants of God find himable to control and overrule all the powers armed against them. Lord,if thou wilt, thou canst. If He be for us, we need not fear what mancan do unto us. God will deliver us, either from death or in death.They must obey God rather than man; they must rather suffer than sin;and must not do evil that good may come. Therefore none of these thingsmoved them. The saving them from sinful compliance, was as great amiracle in the kingdom of grace, as the saving them out of the fieryfurnace was in the kingdom of nature. Fear of man and love of theworld, especially want of faith, make men yield to temptation, while afirm persuasion of the truth will deliver them from denying Christ, orbeing ashamed of him. We are to be meek in our replies, but we must bedecided that we will obey God rather than man.<br>Dan. 3:19-27 Let Nebuchadnezzar heat his furnace as hot as he can, afew minutes will finish the torment of those cast into it; buthell-fire tortures, and yet does not kill. Those who worshipped thebeast and his image, have no rest, no pause, no moment free from pain,Rev. 14:10,11. Now was fulfilled in the letter that great promise, Is.43:2, When thou walkest through the fire, thou shalt not be burned.Leaving it to that God who preserved them in the fire, to bring themout, they walked up and down in the midst, supported and encouraged bythe presence of the Son of God. Those who suffer for Christ, have hispresence in their sufferings, even in the fiery furnace, and in thevalley of the shadow of death. Nebuchadnezzar owns them for servants ofthe most high God; a God able to deliver them out of his hand. It isour God only is the consuming fire, Heb. 12:29. Could we but see intothe eternal world, we should behold the persecuted believer safe fromthe malice of his foes, while they are exposed to the wrath of God, andtormented in unquenchable fires.<br>Dan. 3:28-30 What God did for these his servants, would help to keepthe Jews to their religion while in captivity, and to cure them ofidolatry. The miracle brought deep convictions on Nebuchadnezzar. Butno abiding change then took place in his conduct. He who preservedthese pious Jews in the fiery furnace, is able to uphold us in the hourof temptation, and to keep us from falling into sin.
Dan 4:	<b>Overview</b><br>Nebuchadnezzar acknowledges the power of Jehovah. (Dan. 4:1-18) Danielinterprets his dream. (Dan. 4:19-27) The fulfilment of it. (Dan.4:28-37)<br>Dan. 4:1-18 The beginning and end of this chapter lead us to hope, thatNebuchadnezzar was a monument of the power of Divine grace, and of theriches of Divine mercy. After he was recovered from his madness, hetold to distant places, and wrote down for future ages, how God hadjustly humbled and graciously restored him. When a sinner comes tohimself, he will promote the welfare of others, by making known thewondrous mercy of God. Nebuchadnezzar, before he related the Divinejudgments upon him for his pride, told the warnings he had in a dreamor vision. The meaning was explained to him. The person signified, wasto be put down from honour, and to be deprived of the use of his reasonseven years. This is surely the sorest of all temporal judgments.Whatever outward affliction God is pleased to lay upon us, we havecause to bear it patiently, and to be thankful that he continues theuse of our reason, and the peace of our consciences. Yet if the Lordshould see fit by such means to keep a sinner from multiplying crimes,or a believer from dishonouring his name, even the dreadful preventionwould be far preferable to the evil conduct. God has determined it, asa righteous Judge, and the angels in heaven applaud. Not that the greatGod needs the counsel or concurrence of the angels, but it denotes thesolemnity of this sentence. The demand is by the word of the holy ones,God's suffering people: when the oppressed cry to God, he will hear.Let us diligently seek blessings which can never be taken from us, andespecially beware of pride and forgetfulness of God.<br>Dan. 4:19-27 Daniel was struck with amazement and terror at so heavy ajudgment coming upon so great a prince, and gives advice withtenderness and respect. It is necessary, in repentance, that we notonly cease to do evil, but learn to do good. Though it might not whollyprevent the judgment, yet the trouble may be longer before it comes, orshorter when it does come. And everlasting misery will be escaped byall who repent and turn to God.<br>Dan. 4:28-37 Pride and self-conceit are sins that beset great men. Theyare apt to take that glory to themselves which is due to God only.While the proud word was in the king's mouth, the powerful word camefrom God. His understanding and his memory were gone, and all thepowers of the rational soul were broken. How careful we ought to be,not to do any thing which may provoke God to put us out of our senses!God resists the proud. Nebuchadnezzar would be more than a man, but Godjustly makes him less than a man. We may learn to believe concerningGod, that the most high God lives for ever, and that his kingdom islike himself, everlasting, and universal. His power cannot be resisted.When men are brought to honour God, by confession of sin andacknowledging his sovereignty, then, and not till then, they may expectthat God will honour them; not only restore them to the dignity theylost by the sin of the first Adam, but add excellent majesty to them,from the righteousness and grace of the Second Adam. Afflictions shalllast no longer than till they have done the work for which they weresent. There can be no reasonable doubt that Nebuchadnezzar was a truepenitent, and an accepted believer. It is thought that he did not livemore than a year after his restoration. Thus the Lord knows how toabase those that walk in pride, but gives grace and consolation to thehumble, broken-hearted sinner who calls upon Him.
Dan 5:	<b>Overview</b><br>Belshazzar's impious feast; the hand-writing on the wall. (Dan. 5:1-9)Daniel is sent for to interpret it. (Dan. 5:10-17) Daniel warns theking of his destruction. (Dan. 5:18-31)<br>Dan. 5:1-9 Belshazzar bade defiance to the judgments of God. Mosthistorians consider that Cyrus then besieged Babylon. Security andsensuality are sad proofs of approaching ruin. That mirth is sinfulindeed, which profanes sacred things; and what are many of the songsused at modern feasts better than the praises sung by the heathens totheir gods! See how God struck terror upon Belshazzar and his lords.God's written word is enough to put the proudest, boldest sinner in afright. What we see of God, the part of the hand that writes in thebook of the creatures, and in the book of the Scriptures, should fillus with awful thoughts concerning that part which we do not see. Ifthis be the finger of God, what is his arm when made bare? And what isHe? The king's guilty conscience told him that he had no reason toexpect any good news from heaven. God can, in a moment, make the heartof the stoutest sinner to tremble; and there needs no more than to letloose his own thoughts upon him; they will give him trouble enough. Nobodily pain can equal the inward agony which sometimes seizes thesinner in the midst of mirth, carnal pleasures, and worldly pomp.Sometimes terrors cause a man to flee to Christ for pardon and peace;but many cry out for fear of wrath, who are not humbled for their sins,and who seek relief by lying vanities. The ignorance and uncertaintyconcerning the Holy Scriptures, shown by many who call themselves wise,only tend to drive sinners to despair, as the ignorance of these wisemen did.<br>Dan. 5:10-17 Daniel was forgotten at court; he lived privately, and wasthen ninety years of age. Many consult servants of God on curiousquestions, or to explain difficult subjects, but without asking the wayof salvation, or the path of duty. Daniel slighted the offer of reward.He spoke to Belshazzar as to a condemned criminal. We should despiseall the gifts and rewards this world can give, did we see, as we may byfaith, its end hastening on; but let us do our duty in the world, anddo it all the real service we can.<br>Dan. 5:18-31 Daniel reads Belshazzar's doom. He had not taken warningby the judgments upon Nebuchadnezzar. And he had insulted God. Sinnersare pleased with gods that neither see, nor hear, nor know; but theywill be judged by One to whom all things are open. Daniel reads thesentence written on the wall. All this may well be applied to the doomof every sinner. At death, the sinner's days are numbered and finished;after death is the judgment, when he will be weighed in the balance,and found wanting; and after judgment the sinner will be cut asunder,and given as a prey to the devil and his angels. While these thingswere passing in the palace, it is considered that the army of Cyrusentered the city; and when Belshazzar was slain, a general submissionfollowed. Soon will every impenitent sinner find the writing of God'sword brought to pass upon him, whether he is weighed in the balance ofthe law as a self-righteous Pharisee, or in that of the gospel as apainted hypocrite.
Dan 6:	<b>Overview</b><br>The malice of Daniel's enemies. (Dan. 6:1-5) His constancy in prayer.(Dan. 6:6-10) He is cast into the lion's den. (Dan. 6:11-17) Hismiraculous preservation. (Dan. 6:18-24) The decree of Darius. (Dan.6:25-28)<br>Dan. 6:1-5 We notice to the glory of God, that though Daniel was nowvery old, yet he was able for business, and had continued faithful tohis religion. It is for the glory of God, when those who professreligion, conduct themselves so that their most watchful enemies mayfind no occasion for blaming them, save only in the matters of theirGod, in which they walk according to their consciences.<br>Dan. 6:6-10 To forbid prayer for thirty days, is, for so long, to robGod of all the tribute he has from man, and to rob man of all thecomfort he has in God. Does not every man's heart direct him, when inwant or distress, to call upon God? We could not live a day withoutGod; and can men live thirty days without prayer? Yet it is to befeared that those who, without any decree forbidding them, present nohearty, serious petitions to God for more than thirty days together,are far more numerous than those who serve him continually, withhumble, thankful hearts. Persecuting laws are always made on falsepretences; but it does not become Christians to make bitter complaints,or to indulge in revilings. It is good to have hours for prayer. Danielprayed openly and avowedly; and though a man of vast business, he didnot think that would excuse him from daily exercises of devotion. Howinexcusable are those who have but little to do in the world, yet willnot do thus much for their souls! In trying times we must take heed,lest, under pretence of discretion, we are guilty of cowardice in thecause of God. All who throw away their souls, as those certainly dothat live without prayer, even if it be to save their lives, at the endwill be found to be fools. Nor did Daniel only pray, and not givethanks, cutting off some part of the service to make the time of dangershorter; but he performed the whole. In a word, the duty of prayer isfounded upon the sufficiency of God as an almighty Creator andRedeemer, and upon our wants as sinful creatures. To Christ we mustturn our eyes. Thither let the Christian look, thither let him pray, inthis land of his captivity.<br>Dan. 6:11-17 It is no new thing for what is done faithfully, inconscience toward God, to be misrepresented as done obstinately, and incontempt of the civil powers. Through want of due thought, we often dothat which afterwards, like Darius, we see cause a thousand times towish undone again. Daniel, that venerable man, is brought as the vilestof malefactors, and is thrown into the den of lions, to be devoured,only for worshipping his God. No doubt the placing the stone wasordered by the providence of God, that the miracle of Daniel'sdeliverance might appear more plain; and the king sealed it with hisown signet, probably lest Daniel's enemies should kill him. Let uscommit our lives and souls unto God, in well-doing. We cannot placefull confidence even in men whom we faithfully serve; but believersmay, in all cases, be sure of the Divine favour and consolation.<br>Dan. 6:18-24 The best way to have a good night, is to keep a goodconscience. We are sure of what the king doubted, that the servants ofthe living God have a Master well able to protect them. See the powerof God over the fiercest creatures, and believe his power to restrainthe roaring lion that goeth about continually seeking to devour. Danielwas kept perfectly safe, because he believed in his God. Those whoboldly and cheerfully trust in God to protect them in the way of duty,shall always find him a present help. Thus the righteous is deliveredout of trouble, and the wicked cometh in his stead. The short triumphof the wicked will end in their ruin.<br>Dan. 6:25-28 If we live in the fear of God, and walk according to thatrule, peace shall be upon us. The kingdom, the power, and the glory,for ever, are the Lord's; but many are employed in making known hiswonderful works to others, who themselves remain strangers to hissaving grace. May we be doers, as well as believers of his word, leastat the last we should be found to have deceived ourselves.
Dan 7:	<b>Overview</b><br>Daniel's vision of the four beasts. (Dan. 7:1-8) and of Christ'skingdom. (Dan. 7:9-14) The interpretation. (Dan. 7:15-28)<br>Dan. 7:1-8 This vision contains the same prophetic representations withNebuchadnezzar's dream. The great sea agitated by the winds,represented the earth and the dwellers on it troubled by ambitiousprinces and conquerors. The four beasts signified the same fourempires, as the four parts of Nebuchadnezzar's image. Mighty conquerorsare but instruments of God's vengeance on a guilty world. The savagebeast represents the hateful features of their characters. But thedominion given to each has a limit; their wrath shall be made to praisethe Lord, and the remainder of it he will restrain.<br>Dan. 7:9-14 These verses are for the comfort and support of the peopleof God, in reference to the persecutions that would come upon them.Many New Testament predictions of the judgment to come, have plainallusion to this vision; especially Rev. 20:11,12. The Messiah is herecalled the Son of man; he was made in the likeness of sinful flesh, andwas found in fashion as a man, but he is the Son of God. The greatevent foretold in this passage, is Christ's glorious coming, to destroyevery antichristian power, and to render his own kingdom universal uponearth. But ere the solemn time arrives, for manifesting the glory ofGod to all worlds in his dealings with his creatures, we may expectthat the doom of each of us will be determined at the hour of ourdeath; and before the end shall come, the Father will openly give tohis incarnate Son, our Mediator and Judge, the inheritance of thenations as his willing subjects.<br>Dan. 7:15-28 It is desirable to obtain the right and full sense of whatwe see and hear from God; and those that would know, must ask byfaithful and fervent prayer. The angel told Daniel plainly. Heespecially desired to know respecting the little horn, which made warwith the saints, and prevailed against them. Here is foretold the rageof papal Rome against true Christians. St. John, in his visions andprophecies, which point in the first place at Rome, has plain referenceto these visions. Daniel had a joyful prospect of the prevalence ofGod's kingdom among men. This refers to the second coming of ourblessed Lord, when the saints shall triumph in the complete fall ofSatan's kingdom. The saints of the Most High shall possess the kingdomfor ever. Far be it from us to infer from hence, that dominion isfounded on grace. It promises that the gospel kingdom shall be set up;a kingdom of light, holiness, and love; a kingdom of grace, theprivileges and comforts of which shall be the earnest and first-fruitsof the kingdom of glory. But the full accomplishment will be in theeverlasting happiness of the saints, the kingdom that cannot be moved.The gathering together the whole family of God will be a blessedness ofChrist's coming.
Dan 8:	<b>Overview</b><br>Daniel's vision of the ram and the he-goat. (Dan. 8:1-14) Theinterpretation of it. (Dan. 8:15-27)<br>Dan. 8:1-14 God gives Daniel a foresight of the destruction of otherkingdoms, which in their day were as powerful as that of Babylon. Couldwe foresee the changes that shall be when we are gone, we should beless affected with changes in our own day. The ram with two horns wasthe second empire, that of Media and Persia. He saw this ram overcomeby a he-goat. This was Alexander the Great. Alexander, when aboutthirty-three years of age, and in his full strength, died, and showedthe vanity of worldly pomp and power, and that they cannot make a manhappy. While men dispute, as in the case of Alexander, respecting thedeath of some prosperous warrior, it is plain that the great FirstCause of all had no more of his plan for him to execute, and thereforecut him off. Instead of that one great horn, there came up four notableones, Alexander's four chief captains. A little horn became a greatpersecutor of the church and people of God. It seems that theMohammedan delusion is here pointed out. It prospered, and at one timenearly destroyed the holy religion God's right hand had planted. It isjust with God to deprive those of the privileges of his house whodespise and profane them; and to make those know the worth ofordinances by the want of them, who would not know it by the enjoymentof them. Daniel heard the time of this calamity limited and determined;but not the time when it should come. If we would know the mind of God,we must apply to Christ, in whom are hid all the treasures of wisdomand knowledge; not hid from us, but hid for us. There is muchdifficulty as to the precise time here stated, but the end of it cannotbe very distant. God will, for his own glory, see to the cleansing ofthe church in due time. Christ died to cleanse his church; and he willso cleanse it as to present it blameless to himself.<br>Dan. 8:15-27 The eternal Son of God stood before the prophet in theappearance of a man, and directed the angel Gabriel to explain thevision. Daniel's fainting and astonishment at the prospect of evils hesaw coming on his people and the church, confirm the opinion thatlong-continued calamities were foretold. The vision being ended, acharge was given to Daniel to keep it private for the present. He keptit to himself, and went on to do the duty of his place. As long as welive in this world we must have something to do in it; and even thosewhom God has most honoured, must not think themselves above theirbusiness. Nor must the pleasure of communion with God take us from theduties of our callings, but we must in them abide with God. All who areintrusted with public business must discharge their trust uprightly;and, amidst all doubts and discouragements, they may, if truebelievers, look forward to a happy issue. Thus should we endeavour tocompose our minds for attending to the duties to which each isappointed, in the church and in the world.
Dan 9:	<b>Overview</b><br>Daniel considers the time of the captivity. (Dan. 9:1-3) His confessionof sin, and prayer. (Dan. 9:4-19) The revelation concerning the comingof the Messiah. (Dan. 9:20-27)<br>Dan. 9:1-3 Daniel learned from the books of the prophets, especiallyfrom Jeremiah, that the desolation of Jerusalem would continue seventyyears, which were drawing to a close. God's promises are to encourageour prayers, not to make them needless; and when we see the performanceof them approaching, we should more earnestly plead them with God.<br>Dan. 9:4-19 In every prayer we must make confession, not only of thesins we have been guilty of, but of our faith in God, and dependenceupon him, our sorrow for sin, and our resolutions against it. It mustbe our confession, the language of our convictions. Here is Daniel'shumble, serious, devout address to God; in which he gives glory to himas a God to be feared, and as a God to be trusted. We should, inprayer, look both at God's greatness and his goodness, his majesty andmercy. Here is a penitent confession of sin, the cause of the troublesthe people for so many years groaned under. All who would find mercymust thus confess their sins. Here is a self-abasing acknowledgment ofthe righteousness of God; and it is evermore the way of true penitentsthus to justify God. Afflictions are sent to bring men to turn fromtheir sins, and to understand God's truth. Here is a believing appealto the mercy of God. It is a comfort that God has been always ready topardon sin. It is encouraging to recollect that mercies belong to God,as it is convincing and humbling to recollect that righteousnessbelongs to him. There are abundant mercies in God, not onlyforgiveness, but forgivenesses. Here are pleaded the reproach God'speople was under, and the ruins God's sanctuary was in. Sin is areproach to any people, especially to God's people. The desolations ofthe sanctuary are grief to all the saints. Here is an earnest requestto God to restore the poor captive Jews to their former enjoyments. OLord, hearken and do. Not hearken and speak only, but hearken and do;do that for us which none else can do; and defer not. Here are severalpleas and arguments to enforce the petitions. Do it for the LordChrist's sake; Christ is the Lord of all. And for his sake God causeshis face to shine upon sinners when they repent, and turn to him. Inall our prayers this must be our plea, we must make mention of hisrighteousness, even of his only. The humble, fervent, believingearnestness of this prayer should ever be followed by us.<br>Dan. 9:20-27 An answer was immediately sent to Daniel's prayer, and itis a very memorable one. We cannot now expect that God should sendanswers to our prayers by angels, but if we pray with fervency for thatwhich God has promised, we may by faith take the promise as animmediate answer to the prayer; for He is faithful that has promised.Daniel had a far greater and more glorious redemption discovered tohim, which God would work out for his church in the latter days. Thosewho would be acquainted with Christ and his grace, must be much inprayer. The evening offering was a type of the great sacrifice Christwas to offer in the evening of the world: in virtue of that sacrificeDaniel's prayer was accepted; and for the sake of that, this gloriousdiscovery of redeeming love was made to him. We have, in verses 24-27,one of the most remarkable prophecies of Christ, of his coming and hissalvation. It shows that the Jews are guilty of most obstinateunbelief, in expecting another Messiah, so long after the timeexpressly fixed for his coming. The seventy weeks mean a day for ayear, or 490 years. About the end of this period a sacrifice would beoffered, making full atonement for sin, and bringing in everlastingrighteousness for the complete justification of every believer. Thenthe Jews, in the crucifixion of Jesus, would commit that crime by whichthe measure of their guilt would be filled up, and troubles would comeupon their nation. All blessings bestowed on sinful man come throughChrist's atoning sacrifice, who suffered once for sins, the just forthe unjust, that he might bring us to God. Here is our way of access tothe throne of grace, and of our entrance to heaven. This seals the sumof prophecy, and confirms the covenant with many; and while we rejoicein the blessings of salvation, we should remember what they cost theRedeemer. How can those escape who neglect so great salvation!
Dan 10:	<b>Overview</b><br>Daniel's vision near the river Hiddekel. (Dan. 10:1-9) He is to expecta discovery of future events. (Dan. 10:10-21)<br>Dan. 10:1-9. This chapter relates the beginning of Daniel's lastvision, which is continued to the end of the book. The time would belong before all would be accomplished; and much of it is not yetfulfilled. Christ appeared to Daniel in a glorious form, and it shouldengage us to think highly and honourably of him. Let us admire hiscondescension for us and our salvation. There remained no strength inDaniel. The greatest and best of men cannot bear the full discoveriesof the Divine glory; for no man can see it, and live; but glorifiedsaints see Christ as he is, and can bear the sight. How dreadful soeverChrist may appear to those under convictions of sin, there is enough inhis word to quiet their spirits.<br>Dan. 10:10-21 Whenever we enter into communion with God, it becomes usto have a due sense of the infinite distance between us and the holyGod. How shall we, that are dust and ashes, speak to the Lord of glory?Nothing is more likely, nothing more effectual to revive the droopingspirits of the saints, than to be assured of God's love to them. Fromthe very first day we begin to look toward God in a way of duty, he isready to meet us in the way of mercy. Thus ready is God to hear prayer.When the angel had told the prophet of the things to come, he was toreturn, and oppose the decrees of the Persian kings against the Jews.The angels are employed as God's ministering servants, Heb. 1:14.Though much was done against the Jews by the kings of Persia, Godpermitting it, much more mischief would have been done if God had notprevented it. He would now more fully show what were God's purposes, ofwhich the prophecies form an outline; and we are concerned to studywhat is written in these Scriptures of truth, for they belong to oureverlasting peace. While Satan and his angels, and evil counsellors,excite princes to mischief against the church, we may rejoice thatChrist our Prince, and all his mighty angels, act against our enemies;but we ought not to expect many to favour us in this evil world. Yetthe whole counsel of God shall be established; and let each one pray,Lord Jesus, be our righteousness now, and thou wilt be our everlastingconfidence, through life, in death, at the day of judgment, and forevermore.
Dan 11:	<b>Overview</b><br>The vision of the Scriptures of truth.<br>Dan. 11:1-30 The angel shows Daniel the succession of the Persian andGrecian empires. The kings of Egypt and Syria are noticed: Judea wasbetween their dominions, and affected by their contests. From Dan.11:5-30, is generally considered to relate to the events which came topass during the continuance of these governments; and from Dan. 11:21,to relate to Antiochus Epiphanes, who was a cruel and violentpersecutor of the Jews. See what decaying, perishing things worldlypomp and possessions are, and the power by which they are gotten. God,in his providence, sets up one, and pulls down another, as he pleases.This world is full of wars and fightings, which come from men's lusts.All changes and revolutions of states and kingdoms, and every event,are plainly and perfectly foreseen by God. No word of God shall fall tothe ground; but what he has designed, what he has declared, shallinfallibly come to pass. While the potsherds of the earth strive witheach other, they prevail and are prevailed against, deceive and aredeceived; but those who know God will trust in him, and he will enablethem to stand their ground, bear their cross, and maintain theirconflict.<br>Dan. 11:31-45 The remainder of this prophecy is very difficult, andcommentators differ much respecting it. From Antiochus the accountseems to pass to antichrist. Reference seems to be made to the Romanempire, the fourth monarchy, in its pagan, early Christian, and papalstates. The end of the Lord's anger against his people approaches, aswell as the end of his patience towards his enemies. If we would escapethe ruin of the infidel, the idolater, the superstitious and cruelpersecutor, as well as that of the profane, let us make the oracles ofGod our standard of truth and of duty, the foundation of our hope, andthe light of our paths through this dark world, to the gloriousinheritance above.
Dan 12:	<b>Overview</b><br>The conclusion of the vision of the Scriptures of truth. (Dan. 12:1-4)The times of the continuance of these events. (Dan. 12:5-13)<br>Dan. 12:1-4. Michael signifies, "Who is like God," and his name, withthe title of "the great Prince," points out the Divine Saviour. Christstood for the children of our people in their stead as a sacrifice,bore the curse for them, to bear it from them. He stands for them inpleading for them at the throne of grace. And after the destruction ofantichrist, the Lord Jesus shall stand at the latter day upon theearth; and He shall appear for the complete redemption of all hispeople. When God works deliverance from persecution for them, it is aslife from the dead. When his gospel is preached, many who sleep in thedust, both Jews and Gentiles, shall be awakened by it out of theirheathenism of Judaism. And in the end the multitude that sleep in thedust shall awake; many shall arise to life, and many to shame. There isglory reserved for all the saints in the future state, for all that arewise, wise for their souls and eternity. Those who turn many torighteousness, who turn sinners from the errors of their ways, and helpto save their souls from death, James 5:20, will share in the glory ofthose they have helped to heaven, which will add to their own glory.<br>Dan. 12:5-13 One of the angels asking how long it should be to the endof these wonders, a solemn reply is made, that it would be for a time,times, and a half, the period mentioned Dan. 7:25, and in theRevelation. It signifies 1260 prophetic days or years, beginning fromthe time when the power of the holy people should be scattered. Theimposture of Mohammed, and the papal usurpation, began about the sametime; and these were a twofold attack upon the church of God. But allwill end well at last. All opposing rule, principality, and power,shall be put down, and holiness and love will triumph, and be inhonour, to eternity. The end, this end, shall come. What an amazingprophecy is this, of so many varied events, and extending through somany successive ages, even to the general resurrection! Daniel mustcomfort himself with the pleasing prospect of his own happiness indeath, in judgment, and to eternity. It is good for us all to thinkmuch of going away from this world. That must be our way; but it is ourcomfort that we shall not go till God calls us to another world, andtill he has done with us in this world; till he says, Go thou thy way,thou hast done thy work, therefore now, go thy way, and leave it toothers to take thy place. It was a comfort to Daniel, and is a comfortto all the saints, that whatever their lot is in the days of theirlives, they shall have a happy lot in the end of the days. And it oughtto be the great care and concern of every one of us to secure this.Then we may well be content with our present lot, and welcome the willof God. Believers are happy at all times; they rest in God by faithnow, and a rest is reserved for them in heaven at last.
Hos 1:	<b>Overview</b><br>Under a figure, is represented the shameful idolatry of the ten tribes.(Hos. 1:1-7) The calling of the Gentiles, and the uniting Israel andJudah under the Messiah. (Hos. 1:8-11)<br>Hos. 1:1-7 Israel was prosperous, yet then Hosea boldly tells them oftheir sins, and foretells their destruction. Men are not to beflattered in sinful ways because they prosper in the world; nor will itlast long if they go on still in their trespasses. The prophet mustshow Israel their sin; show it to be exceedingly hateful. Theiridolatry is the sin they are here charged with. Giving that glory toany creature which is due to God alone, is an injury and affront toGod; such as for a wife to take a stranger, is to her husband. TheLord, doubtless, had good reasons for giving such a command to theprophet; it would form an affecting picture of the Lord's unmeritedgoodness and unwearied patience, and of the perverseness andingratitude of Israel. We should be broken and wearied with half thatperverseness from others, with which we try the patience and grieve theSpirit of our God. Let us also be ready to bear any cross the Lordappoints. The prophet must show the ruin of the people, in the namesgiven to his children. He foretells the fall of the royal family in thename of his first child: call his name Jezreel, which signifies"dispersion." He foretells God's abandoning the nation in the name ofthe second child; Lo-ruhamah, "not beloved," or "not having obtainedmercy." God showed great mercy, but Israel abused his favours. Sinturns away the mercy of God, even from Israel, his own professingpeople. If pardoning mercy is denied, no other mercy can be expected.Though some, through unbelief, are broken off, yet God will have achurch in this world till the end of time. Our salvation is owing toGod's mercy, not to any merit of our own. That salvation is sure, ofwhich he is the Author; and if he will work, none shall hinder.<br>Hos. 1:8-11 The rejection of Israel for a time, is signified by thename of another child: call him Lo-ammi, "not my people." The Lorddisowns all relation to them. We love him, because he first loved us;but our being cast out of covenant, is owing to ourselves and ourfolly. Mercy is remembered in the midst of wrath; the rejection, as itshall not be total, so it shall not be final. The same hand thatwounded, is stretched forth to heal. Very precious promises are heregiven concerning the Israel of God, and they may be of use to us now.Some think that these promises will not have accomplishment in full,till the general conversion of the Jews in the latter days. Also thispromise is applied to the gospel, and the bringing in both the Jews andGentiles to it, by St. Paul, Rom. 9:25,26, and by St. Peter, I Pet.2:10. To believe in Christ, is to have him for our Head, and willinglyto commit ourselves to his guidance and government. And let us pray forthe coming of the glorious day, when there shall be one Lord throughall the earth.
Hos 2:	<b>Overview</b><br>The idolatry of the people. (Hos. 2:1-5) God's judgments against them.(Hos. 2:6-13) His promises of reconciliation. (Hos. 2:14-23)<br>Hos. 2:1-5 This chapter continues the figurative address to Israel, inreference to Hosea's wife and children. Let us own and love asbrethren, all whom the Lord seems to put among his children, andencourage them in that they have received mercy. But every Christian,by his example and conduct, must protest against evil and abuses, evenamong those to whom he belongs and owes respect. Impenitent sinnerswill soon be stripped of the advantages they misuse, and which theyconsume upon their lusts.<br>Hos. 2:6-13 God threatens what he would do with this treacherous,idolatrous people. They did not turn, therefore all this came uponthem; and it is written for admonition to us. If lesser difficulties begot over, God will raise greater. The most resolute in sinful pursuits,are commonly most crossed in them. The way of God and duty is oftenhedged about with thorns, but we have reason to think it is a sinfulway that is hedged up with thorns. Crosses and obstacles in an evilcourse are great blessings, and are to be so accounted; they are God'shedges, to keep us from transgressing, to make the way of sindifficult, and to keep us from it. We have reason to bless God forrestraining grace, and for restraining providences; and even for sorepain, sickness, or calamity, if it keeps us from sin. Thedisappointments we meet with in seeking for satisfaction from thecreature, should, if nothing else will do it, drive us to the Creator.When men forget, or consider not that their comforts come from God, hewill often in mercy take them away, to bring them to think upon theirfolly and danger. Sin and mirth can never hold long together; but ifmen will not take away sin from their mirth, God will take away mirthfrom their sin. And if men destroy God's word and ordinances, it isjust with him to destroy their vines and fig-trees. This shall be theruin of their mirth. Taking away the solemn seasons and the sabbathswill not do it, they will readily part with them, and think it no loss;but He will take away their sensual pleasures. Days of sinful mirthmust be visited with days of mourning.<br>Hos. 2:14-23 After these judgments the Lord would deal with Israel moregently. By the promise of rest in Christ we are invited to take hisyoke upon us; and the work of conversion may be forwarded by comfortsas well as by convictions. But usually the Lord drives us to despair ofearthly joy, and help from ourselves, that, being shut from every otherdoor, we may knock at Mercy's gate. From that time Israel would be moretruly attached to the Lord; no longer calling him Baali, or "My lordand master," alluding to authority, rather than love, but Ishi, anaddress of affection. This may foretell the restoration from theBabylonish captivity; and also be applied to the conversion of the Jewsto Christ, in the days of the apostles, and the future generalconversion of that nation; and believers are enabled to expectinfinitely more tenderness and kindness from their holy God, than abeloved wife can expect from the kindest husband. When the people wereweaned from idols, and loved the Lord, no creature should do them anyharm. This may be understood of the blessings and privileges of thespiritual Israel, of every true believer, and their partaking ofChrist's righteousness; also, of the conversion of the Jews to Christ.Here is an argument for us to walk so that God may not be dishonouredby us: Thou art my people. If a man's family walk disorderly, it is adishonour to the master. If God call us children, we may say, Thou artour God. Unbelieving soul, lay aside discouraging thoughts; do not thusanswer God's loving-kindness. Doth God say, Thou art my people? Say,Lord, thou art our God.
Hos 3:	<b>Overview</b><br>The prophet enters into a new contract, representing the graciousmanner in which God will again restore Israel under a new covenant.<br>Hos. 3:1-3 The dislike of men to true religion is because they loveobjects and forms, which allow them to indulge, instead of mortifyingtheir lusts. How wonderful that a holy God should have good-will tothose whose carnal mind is enmity against Him! Here is representedGod's gracious dealings with the fallen race of mankind, that had gonefrom him. This is the covenant of grace he is willing to enter intowith them, they must be to him a people, and he will be to them a God.They must accept the punishment of their sin, and must not return tofolly. And it is a certain sign that our afflictions are means of goodto us, when we are kept from being overcome by the temptations of anafflicted state.<br>Hos. 3:4-5 Here is the application of the parable to Israel. They mustlong sit like a widow, stripped of all joys and honours; but shall atlength be received again. Those that would seek the Lord so as to findhim, must apply to Christ, and become his willing people. Not only arewe to fear the Lord and his greatness, but the Lord and his goodness;not only his majesty, but his mercy. Even Jewish writers apply thispassage to the promised Messiah; doubtless it foretold their futureconversion to Christ, for which they are kept a separate people. Thoughthe first fear of God arise from a view of his holy majesty andrighteous vengeance, yet the experience of mercy and grace throughJesus Christ, will lead the heart to reverence so kind and glorious aFriend and Father, and to fear offending him.
Hos 4:	<b>Overview</b><br>God's judgments against the sins of the people. (Hos. 4:1-5) and of thepriests. (Hos. 4:6-11) Idolatry is reproved, and Judah is admonished.(Hos. 4:12-19)<br>Hos. 4:1-5 Hosea reproves for immorality, as well as idolatry. Therewas no truth, mercy, or knowledge of God in the land: it was full ofmurders, II Kin. 21:16. Therefore calamities were near, which woulddesolate the country. Our sins, as separate persons, as a family, as aneighbourhood, as a nation, cause the Lord to have a controversy withus; let us submit and humble ourselves before Him, that he may not goon to destroy.<br>Hos. 4:6-11 Both priests and people rejected knowledge; God will justlyreject them. They forgot the law of God, neither desired norendeavoured to retain it in mind, and to transmit the remembrance totheir posterity; therefore God will justly forget them and theirchildren. If we dishonour God with that which is our honour, it will,sooner or later, be turned into shame to us. Instead of warning thepeople against sin, from the consideration of the sacrifices, whichshowed what an offence sin was to God, since it needed an atonement,the priests encouraged the people to sin, since atonement might be madeat so small an expense. It is very wicked to be pleased with the sinsof others, because they may turn to our advantage. What is unlawfullygained, cannot be comfortably used. The people and the priests hardenedone another in sin; therefore justly shall they share in thepunishment. Sharers in sin must expect to share in ruin. Any lustharboured in the heart, in time will eat out all its strength andvigour. That is the reason why many professors grow so heavy, so dull,so dead in the way of religion. They have a liking for some secretlust, which takes away their hearts.<br>Hos. 4:12-19 The people consulted images, and not the Divine word. Thiswould lead to disorder and sin. Thus men prepare scourges forthemselves, and vice is spread through a people. Let not Judah comenear the idolatrous worship of Israel. For Israel was devoted to idols,and must now be let alone. When sinners cast off the easy yoke ofChrist, they go on in sin till the Lord saith, Let them alone. Thenthey receive no more warnings, feel no more convictions: Satan takesfull possession of them, and they ripen for destruction. It is a sadand sore judgment for any man to be let alone in sin. Those who are notdisturbed in their sin, will be destroyed for their sin. May we be keptfrom this awful state; for the wrath of God, like a strong tempest,will soon hurry impenitent sinners into ruin.
Hos 5:	<b>Overview</b><br>The Divine judgments against Israel. (Hos. 5:1-7) Approachingdesolations threatened. (Hos. 5:8-15)<br>Hos. 5:1-7 The piercing eye of God saw secret liking and disposition tosin, the love the house of Israel had to their sins, and the dominiontheir sins had over them. Pride makes men obstinate in other sins. Andas Judah was treading in the same steps, they would fall with Israel.By dealing treacherously with the Lord, men only deceive themselves.Those that go to seek the Lord with their flocks and their herds only,and not with their hearts and souls, cannot expect to find him; norshall any speed who do not seek the Lord while he may be found. See howmuch it is our concern to seek God early, now, while it is the acceptedtime, and the day of salvation.<br>Hos. 5:8-15 The destruction of impenitent sinners is not mere talk, tofrighten them, it is a sentence which will not be recalled. And it is amercy that we have timely warning given us, that we may flee from thewrath to come. Compliance with the commandments of men, who thwart thecommandments of God, ripens a people for ruin. The judgments of God aresometimes to a sinful people as a moth, and as rottenness, or as aworm; as these consume the clothes and the wood, so shall the judgmentsof God consume them. Silently, they shall think themselves safe andthriving, but when they look into their state, shall find themselveswasting and decaying. Slowly, for the Lord gives them space to repent.Many a nation; as well as many a person, dies of a consumption.Gradually, God comes upon sinners with lesser judgments, to preventgreater, if they will be wise, and take warning. When Israel and Judahfound themselves in danger, they sought the protection of theAssyrians, but this only helped to make their wound the worse. Theywould be forced to apply to God. He will bring them home to himself, byafflictions. When men begin to complain more of their sins than oftheir afflictions, then there begins to be some hope of them; and whenunder the conviction of sin, and the corrections of the rod, we mustseek the knowledge of God. Those who are led by severe trials to seekGod earnestly and sincerely, will find him a present help and aneffectual refuge; for with him is plenteous redemption for all who callupon him. There is solid peace, and there only, where God is.
Hos 6:	<b>Overview</b><br>An exhortation to repentance. (Hos. 6:1-3) Israel's instability andbreach of the covenant. (Hos. 6:4-11)<br>Hos. 6:1-3 Those who have gone from God by consent, and in a body,drawing one another to sin, should, by consent and in a body, return tohim, which will be for his glory, and their good. It will be of greatuse for support under afflictions, and to encourage our repentance, tokeep up good thoughts of God, and of his purposes and designsconcerning us. Deliverance out of trouble should be to them as lifefrom the dead. God will revive them: the assurance of this shouldengage them to return to him. But this seems to have a furtherreference to the resurrection of Jesus Christ. Let us admire the wisdomand goodness of God, that when the prophet foretold the deliverance ofthe church out of her troubles, he should point out our salvation byChrist; and now these words are fulfilled in the resurrection ofChrist, it confirms our faith, that this is He that should come and weare to look for no other. Here is a precious blessing promised; this islife eternal, to know God. The returns of the favour of God are securedto us as firmly as the return of the morning after a dark night. Heshall come to us as the latter and former rain unto the earth, whichrefreshes it, and makes it fruitful. The grace of God in Christ is boththe latter and the former rain; and by it the good work of ourfruit-bearing is begun and carried on. And as the Redeemer was raisedfrom the grave, so will He revive the hearts and hopes of all thattrust in him. The feeblest glimpse of hope in his word, is a sureearnest of increasing light and comfort, which shall be attended withpurifying, comforting grace that makes fruitful.<br>Hos. 6:4-11 Sometimes Israel and Judah seemed disposed to repent undertheir sufferings, but their goodness vanished like the empty morningcloud, and the early dew, and they were as vile as ever. Therefore theLord sent awful messages by the prophets. The word of God will be thedeath either of the sin or of the sinner. God desired mercy rather thansacrifice, and that knowledge of him which produces holy fear and love.This exposes the folly of those who trust in outward observances, tomake up for their want of love to God and man. As Adam broke thecovenant of God in paradise, so Israel had broken his nationalcovenant, notwithstanding all the favours they received. Judah also wasripe for Divine judgments. May the Lord put his fear into our hearts,and set up his kingdom within us, and never leave us to ourselves, norsuffer us to be overcome by temptation.
Hos 7:	<b>Overview</b><br>The manifold sins of Israel. (Hos. 7:1-7) Their senselessness andhypocrisy. (Hos. 7:8-16)<br>Hos. 7:1-7 A practical disbelief of God's government was at the bottomof all israel's wickedness; as if God could not see it or did not heedit. Their sins appear on every side of them. Their hearts were inflamedby evil desires, like a heated oven. In the midst of their troubles asa nation, the people never thought of seeking help from God. The actualwickedness of men's lives bears a very small proportion to what is intheir hearts. But when lust is inwardly cherished, it will break forthinto outward sin. Those who tempt others to drunkenness never can betheir real friends, and often design their ruin. Thus men execute theDivine vengeance on each other. Those are not only heated with sin, buthardened in sin, who continue to live without prayer, even when introuble and distress.<br>Hos. 7:8-16 Israel was as a cake not turned, half burnt and half dough,none of it fit for use; a mixture of idolatry and of the worship ofJehovah. There were tokens of approaching ruin, as grey hairs are ofold age, but they noticed them not. The pride which leads to break thelaw of God leads to self-flattery. The mercy and grace of God are theonly refuge to which obstinate sinners never think of fleeing. Thoughthey may howl forth their terrors in the form of prayers, they seldomcry to God with their hearts. Even their prayers for earthly merciesonly seek fuel for their lusts. Their turning from one sect, sentiment,form, or vice, to another, still leaves them far short of Christ andholiness. Such are we by nature. And such shall we prove if left toourselves. Create in us a clean heart, O God, and renew a right spiritwithin us.
Hos 8:	<b>Overview</b><br>Destruction threatened for the impiety of Israel. (Hos. 8:1-4) Fortheir idolatry. (Hos. 8:5-10) Further threatenings for the same sins.(Hos. 8:11-14)<br>Hos. 8:1-4 When Israel was hard pressed, they would claim protectionfrom God, but this would be disregarded. What stead will it stand in tosay, My God, I know thee, if we cannot say, My God, I love thee, servethee, and cleave to thee only?<br>Hos. 8:5-10 They promised themselves plenty, peace, and victory, byworshipping idols, but their expectations came to nothing. What theysow has no stalk, no blade, or, if it have, the bud shall yield nofruit, there was nothing in them. The works of darkness are unfruitful;nay, the end of those things is death. The hopes of sinners willdeceive them, and their gains will be snares. In times of danger,especially in the day of judgment, all carnal devices will fail. Theytake a course by themselves, and like a wild ass by himself, they willbe the easier and surer prey for the lion. Man is in nothing more likethe wild ass's colt, than in seeking for that succour and thatsatisfaction in the creature, which are to be had in God only. Thoughmen may sorrow a little, yet if it is not after a godly sort, they willbe brought to sorrow everlastingly.<br>Hos. 8:11-14 It is a great sin to corrupt the worship of God, and willbe charged as sin on all who do it, how plausible soever their excusesmay seem to be. The Lord had caused his law to be written for them, butthey cared not to know, and would not obey it. Man seems by the templeshe builds to be mindful of his Maker, yet really he has forgotten him,because he has cast off all his fear; but none ever hardened his heartagainst God and prospered. So long as men despise the truths andprecepts of God's word, and the ordinances of his worship, all theobservances and offerings, however costly, of their own devising, willbe unto them for sin; for those services only are acceptable to God,which are done according to his word, and through Jesus Christ.
Hos 9:	<b>Overview</b><br>The distress to come upon Israel. (Hos. 9:1-6) The approach of the dayof trouble. (Hos. 9:7-10) Judgments on Israel. (Hos. 9:11-17)<br>Hos. 9:1-6 Israel gave rewards to their idols, in the offeringspresented to them. It is common for those who are niggardly inreligion, to be prodigal upon their lusts. Those are reckoned asidolaters, who love a reward in the corn-floor better than a reward inthe favour of God and in eternal life. They are full of the joy ofharvest, and have no disposition to mourn for sin. When we make theworld, and the things of it, our idol and our portion, it is just withGod to show us our folly, and correct us. None may expect to dwell inthe Lord's land, who will not be subject to the Lord's laws, or beinfluenced by his love. When we enjoy the means of grace, we ought toconsider what we shall do, if they should be taken from us. While thepleasures of communion with God are out of the reach of change, thepleasant places purchased with silver, or in which men deposit silver,are liable to be laid in ruins. No famine is so dreadful as that of thesoul.<br>Hos. 9:7-10 Time had been when the spiritual watchmen of Israel werewith the Lord, but now they were like the snare of a fowler to entanglepersons to their ruin. The people were become as corrupt as those ofGibeah, Judg. 19; and their crimes should be visited in like manner. Atfirst God had found Israel pleasing to Him, as grapes to the travellerin the wilderness. He saw them with pleasure as the first ripe figs.This shows the delight God took in them; yet they followed afteridolatry.<br>Hos. 9:11-17. God departs from a people, or from a person, when hewithdraws his goodness and mercy from them; and when the Lord isdeparted, what can the creature do? Even though, for the present, goodthings seem to remain, yet the blessing is gone if God is gone. Eventhe children should perish with the parents. The Divine wrath dries upthe root, and withers the fruit of all comforts; and the scattered Jewsdaily warn us to beware, lest we neglect or abuse the gospel. Yet everysmiting is not a drying up of the root. It may be that God intends onlyto smite so that the sap may be turned to the root, that there may bemore of root graces, more humility, patience, faith, and self-denial.It is very just that God should bring judgments on those who slight hisoffered mercy.
Hos 10:	<b>Overview</b><br>The idolatry of Israel. (Hos. 10:1-8) They are exhorted to repentance.(Hos. 10:9-15)<br>Hos. 10:1-8 A vine is only valuable for its fruit; but Israel nowbrought no fruit to perfection. Their hearts were divided. God is theSovereign of the heart; he will have all, or none. Were the stream ofthe heart wholly after God, it would run strongly, and bear down allbefore it. Their pretences to covenant with God were false. Even theproceeding of justice was as poisonous hemlock. Alas, how empty a vineis the visible church even at this day! But all earthly prosperity isbut a collection of bubbles, soon destroyed like foam upon the water.Sinners will in vain seek shelter from that Judge, whom they nowdespise as a Saviour.<br>Hos. 10:9-15 Because God does not desire the death and ruin of sinners,therefore in mercy he desires their chastisement. The children ofiniquity still remained in Israel. The enemies would be gatheredagainst them. It is just with God to make those know what hardshipsmean, who indulge themselves in ease and pleasure. Let them cleansetheir hearts from all corrupt affections and lusts, and be a broken andcontrite spirit. Let them abound in works of piety towards God, and ofjustice and charity towards one another: herein let them sow to theSpirit. Seeking the Lord is to be every day's work, but there arespecial occasions when to seek him. Christ shall come as the Lord ourrighteousness, and grant us of it abundantly. If we sow inrighteousness, we shall reap according to mercy; a reward not of debt,but of grace. Even the gains of sin yield the sinner no satisfaction.As our comforts, so our confidences in the service of sin willcertainly fail us. Come and seek the Lord, and thy hope in him shallnot deceive thee. See what cruel work war makes. Whatever mischief isdone, it is sin that does it. What miseries men's sins bring on them,even in this world!
Hos 11:	<b>Overview</b><br>God's regard for Israel; their ingratitude. (Hos. 11:1-7) The Divinemercy yet in store. (Hos. 11:8-12)<br>Hos. 11:1-7 When Israel were weak and helpless as children, foolish andfroward as children, then God loved them; he bore them as the nursedoes the sucking child, nourished them, and suffered their manners. Allwho are grown up, ought often to reflect upon the goodness of God tothem in their childhood. He took care of them, took pains with them,not only as a father, or a tutor, but as a mother, or nurse. When theywere in the wilderness, God showed them the way in which they shouldgo, and bore them up, taking them by the arms. He taught them the wayof his commandments by the ceremonial law given by Moses. He took themby the arms, to guide them, that they might not stray, and to hold themup, that they might not stumble and fall. God's spiritual Israel areall thus supported. It is God's work to draw poor souls to himself; andnone can come to him except he draw them. With bands of love; this wordsignifies stronger cords than the former. He eased them of the burdensthey had long groaned under. Israel is very ungrateful to God. God'scounsels would have saved them, but their own counsels ruined them.They backslide; there is no hold of them, no stedfastness in them. Theybackslide from me, from God, the chief good. They are bent tobackslide; they are ready to sin; they are forward to close with everytemptation. Their hearts are fully set in them to do evil. Those onlyare truly happy, whom the Lord teaches by his Spirit, upholds by hispower, and causes to walk in his ways. By his grace he takes away thelove and dominion of sin, and creates a desire for the blessed feast ofthe gospel, that they may feed thereon, and live for ever.<br>Hos. 11:8-12 God is slow to anger, and is loth to abandon a people toutter ruin, who have been called by his name. When God was to give asacrifice for sin, and a Saviour for sinners, he spared not his ownSon, that he might spare us. This is the language of the day of hispatience; but when men sin that away, then the great day of his wrathcomes. Man's compassions are nothing in comparison with the tendermercies of our God, whose thoughts and ways, in receiving returningsinners, are as much above ours as heaven is above the earth. God knowshow to pardon poor sinners. He is faithful and just to forgive us oursins, and therein declares his righteousness, now Christ has purchasedthe pardon, and he has promised it. Holy trembling at the word ofChrist will draw us to him, not drive us from him, the childrentremble, and flee to him. And all that come at the gospel call, shallhave a place and a name in the gospel church. The religious service ofIsrael were mere hypocrisy, but in Judah regard was had to God's laws,and the people followed their pious forefathers. Let us be faithful:those who thus honour God, he will honour, but such us despise Himshall be lightly esteemed.
Hos 12:	<b>Overview</b><br>Judah and Israel reminded of the Divine favours. (Hos. 12:1-6) Theprovocations of Israel. (Hos. 12:7-14)<br>Hos. 12:1-6 Ephraim feeds himself with vain hopes of help from man,when he is at enmity with God. The Jews vainly thought to secure theEgyptians by a present of the produce of their country. Judah iscontended with also. God sees the sin of his own people, and willreckon with them for it. They are put in mind of what Jacob did, andwhat God did for him. When his faith upon the Divine promise prevailedabove his fears, then by his strength he had power with God. He isJehovah, the same that was, and is, and is to come. What was arevelation of God to one, is his memorial to many, to all generations.Then let those who have gone from God, be turned to him. Turn thou tothe Lord, by repentance and faith, as thy God. Let those that areconverted to him, walk with him in all holy conversation and godliness.Let us wrestle with Him for promised blessings, determined not to giveover till we prevail; and let us seek Him in his ordinances.<br>Hos. 12:7-14 Ephraim became a merchant: the word also signifies aCanaanite. They carried on trade upon Canaanitish principles,covetously and with fraud and deceit. Thus they became rich, andfalsely supposed that Providence favoured them. But shameful sins shallhave shameful punishments. Let them remember, not only what a mightyprince Jacob was with God, but what a servant he was to Laban. Thebenefits we have had from the word of God, make our sin and folly theworse, if we put any slight upon that word. We had better follow thehardest labour in poverty, than grow rich by sin. We may form ajudgment of our own conduct, by comparing it with that of ancientbelievers in the like circumstances. Whoever despises the message ofGod, will perish. May we all hear his word with humble, obedient faith.
Hos 13:	<b>Overview</b><br>The abuse of God's favour leads to punishment. (Hos. 13:1-8) A promiseof God's mercy. (Hos. 13:9-16)<br>Hos. 13:1-8 While Ephraim kept up a holy fear of God, and worshippedHim in that fear, so long he was very considerable. When Ephraimforsook God, and followed idolatry, he sunk. Let the men that sacrificekiss the calves, in token of their adoration of them, affection forthem, and obedience to them; but the Lord will not give his glory toanother, and therefore all that worship images shall be confounded. Nosolid, lasting comfort, is to be expected any where but in God. God notonly took care of the Israelites in the wilderness, he put them inpossession of Canaan, a good land; but worldly prosperity, when itfeeds men's pride, makes them forgetful of God. Therefore the Lordwould meet them in just vengeance, as the most terrible beast thatinhabited their forests. Abused goodness calls for greater severity.<br>Hos. 13:9-16 Israel had destroyed himself by his rebellion; but hecould not save himself, his help was from the Lord only. This may wellbe applied to the case of spiritual redemption, from that lost stateinto which all have fallen by wilful sins. God often gives indispleasure what we sinfully desire. It is the happiness of the saints,that, whether God gives or takes away, all is in love. But it is themisery of the wicked, that, whether God gives or takes away, it is allin wrath, nothing is comfortable. Except sinners repent and believe thegospel, anguish will soon come upon them. The prophecy of the ruin ofIsrael as a nation, also showed there would be a merciful and powerfulinterposition of God, to save a remnant of them. Yet this was but ashadow of the ransom of the true Israel, by the death, burial, andresurrection of Christ. He will destroy death and the grave. The Lordwould not repent of his purpose and promise. Yet, in the mean time,Israel would be desolated for her sins. Without fruitfulness in goodworks, springing from the Holy Spirit, all other fruitfulness will befound as empty as the uncertain riches of the world. The wrath of Godwill wither its branches, its sprigs shall be dried up, it shall cometo nothing. Woes, more terrible than any from the most cruel warfare,shall fall on those who rebel against God. From such miseries, and fromsin, the cause of them, may the Lord deliver us.
Hos 14:	<b>Overview</b><br>An exhortation to repentance. (Hos. 14:1-3) Blessings promised, showingthe rich comforts of the gospel. (Hos. 14:4-8) The just and the wicked.(Hos. 14:9)<br>Hos. 14:1-3 Israel is exhorted to return unto Jehovah, from their sinsand idols, by faith in his mercy, and grace through the promisedRedeemer, and by diligently attending on his worship and service. Takeaway iniquity; lift it off as a burden we are ready to sink under, oras the stumbling-block we have often fallen over. Take it all away by afree and full forgiveness, for we cannot strike any of it off. Receiveour prayer graciously. They do not say what good they seek, but referit to God. It is not good of the world's showing, but good of God'sgiving. They were to consider their sins, their wants, and the remedy;and they were to take, not sacrifices, but words stating the desires oftheir hearts, and with them to address the Lord. The whole forms aclear description of the nature and tendency of a sinner's conversionto God through Jesus Christ. As we draw near to God by the prayer offaith, we should first beseech him to teach us what to ask. We must beearnest with him to take away all iniquity.<br>Hos. 14:4-8 Israel seeks God's face, and they shall not seek it invain. His anger is turned from them. Whom God loves, he loves freely;not because they deserve it, but of his own good pleasure. God will beto them all they need. The graces of the Spirit are the hidden manna,hidden in the dew; the grace thus freely bestowed on them shall not bein vain. They shall grow upward, and be more flourishing; shall grow asthe lily. The lily, when come to its height, is a lovely flower, Matt.6:28,29. They shall grow downward, and be more firm. With the flower ofthe lily shall be the strong root of the cedar of Lebanon. Spiritualgrowth consists most in the growth of the root, which is out of sight.They shall also spread as the vine, whose branches extend very widely.When believers abound in good works, then their branches spread. Theyshall be acceptable both to God and man. Holiness is the beauty of asoul. The church is compared to the vine and the olive, which bringforth useful fruits. God's promises pertain to those only that attendon his ordinances; not such as flee to this shadow only for shelter ina hot gleam, but all who dwell under it. When a man is brought to God,all who dwell under his shadow fare the better. The sanctifying fruitsshall appear in his life. Thus believers grow up into the experienceand fruitfulness of the gospel. Ephraim shall say, God will put it intohis heart to say it, What have I to do any more with idols! God'spromises to us are more our security and our strength for mortifyingsin, than our promises to God. See the power of Divine grace. God willwork such a change in him, that he shall loathe the idols as much asever he loved them. See the benefit of sanctified afflictions. Ephraimsmarted for his idolatry, and this is the fruit, even the taking awayhis sin, Is. 27:9. See the nature of repentance; it is a firm and fixedresolution to have no more to do with sin. The Lord meets penitentswith mercy, as the father of the prodigal met his returning son. Godwill be to all true converts both a delight and a defence; they shallsit under his shadow with delight. And as the root of a tree; From meis thy fruit found: from Him we receive grace and strength to enable usto do our duty.<br>Hos. 14:9 Who profit by the truths the prophet delivered? Such as setthemselves to understand and know these things. The ways of God'sprovidence towards us are right; all is well done. Christ is aFoundation Stone to some, to others a Stone of stumbling, and a Rock ofoffence. That which was ordained to life, becomes, through their abuseof it, death to them. The same sun softens wax and hardens clay. Butthose transgressors certainly have the most dangerous, fatal falls, whofall in the ways of God, who split on the Rock of Ages, and suck poisonout of the Balm of Gilead. Let sinners in Zion fear this. May we learnto walk in the right ways of God, as his righteous servants, and maynone of us be disobedient and unbelieving, and stumble at the word.
Joe 1:	<b>Overview</b><br>A plague of locusts. (Joel 1:1-7) All sorts of people are called tolament it. (Joel 1:8-13) They are to look to God. (Joel 1:14-20)<br>Joel 1:1-7 The most aged could not remember such calamities as wereabout to take place. Armies of insects were coming upon the land to eatthe fruits of it. It is expressed so as to apply also to thedestruction of the country by a foreign enemy, and seems to refer tothe devastations of the Chaldeans. God is Lord of hosts, has everycreature at his command, and, when he pleases, can humble and mortify aproud, rebellious people, by the weakest and most contemptiblecreatures. It is just with God to take away the comforts which areabused to luxury and excess; and the more men place their happiness inthe gratifications of sense, the more severe temporal afflictions areupon them. The more earthly delights we make needful to satisfy us, themore we expose ourselves to trouble.<br>Joel 1:8-13 All who labour only for the meat that perishes, will,sooner or later, be ashamed of their labour. Those that place theirhappiness in the delights of sense, when deprived of them, or disturbedin the enjoyment, lose their joy; whereas spiritual joy then flourishesmore than ever. See what perishing, uncertain things ourcreature-comforts are. See how we need to live in continual dependenceupon God and his providence. See what ruinous work sin makes. As far aspoverty occasions the decay of piety, and starves the cause of religionamong a people, it is a very sore judgment. But how blessed are theawakening judgments of God, in rousing his people and calling home theheart to Christ, and his salvation!<br>Joel 1:14-20 The sorrow of the people is turned into repentance andhumiliation before God. With all the marks of sorrow and shame, sinmust be confessed and bewailed. A day is to be appointed for thispurpose; a day in which people must be kept from their commonemployments, that they may more closely attend God's services; andthere is to be abstaining from meat and drink. Every one had added tothe national guilt, all shared in the national calamity, thereforeevery one must join in repentance. When joy and gladness are cut offfrom God's house, when serious godliness decays, and love waxes cold,then it is time to cry unto the Lord. The prophet describes howgrievous the calamity. See even the inferior creatures suffering forour transgression. And what better are they than beasts, who never cryto God but for corn and wine, and complain of the want of the delightsof sense? Yet their crying to God in those cases, shames the stupidityof those who cry not to God in any case. Whatever may become of thenations and churches that persist in ungodliness, believers will findthe comfort of acceptance with God, when the wicked shall be burned upwith his indignation.
Joe 2:	<b>Overview</b><br>God's judgments. (Joel 2:1-14) Exhortations to fasting and prayer;blessings promised. (Joel 2:15-27) A promise of the Holy Spirit, and offuture mercies. (Joel 2:28-32)<br>Joel 2:1-14 The priests were to alarm the people with the near approachof the Divine judgments. It is the work of ministers to warn of thefatal consequences of sin, and to reveal the wrath from heaven againstthe ungodliness and unrighteousness of men. The striking descriptionwhich follows, shows what would attend the devastations of locusts, butmay also describe the effects from the ravaging of the land by theChaldeans. If the alarm of temporal judgments is given to offendingnations, how much more should sinners be warned to seek deliverancefrom the wrath to come! Our business therefore on earth must especiallybe, to secure an interest in our Lord Jesus Christ; and we should seekto be weaned from objects which will soon be torn from all who now makeidols of them. There must be outward expressions of sorrow and shame,fasting, weeping, and mourning; tears for trouble must be turned intotears for the sin that caused it. But rending the garments would bevain, except their hearts were rent by abasement and self-abhorrence;by sorrow for their sins, and separation from them. There is noquestion but that if we truly repent of our sins, God will forgivethem; but whether he will remove affliction is not promised, yet theprobability of it should encourage us to repent.<br>Joel 2:15-27 The priests and rulers are to appoint a solemn fast. Thesinner's supplication is, Spare us, good Lord. God is ready to succourhis people; and he waits to be gracious. They prayed that God wouldspare them, and he answered them. His promises are real answers to theprayers of faith; with him saying and doing are not two things. Someunderstand these promises figuratively, as pointing to gospel grace,and as fulfilled in the abundant comforts treasured up for believers inthe covenant of grace.<br>Joel 2:28-32 The promise began to be fulfilled on the day of Pentecost,when the Holy Spirit was poured out, and it was continued in theconverting grace and miraculous gifts conferred on both Jews andGentiles. The judgments of God upon a sinful world, only go before thejudgment of the world in the last day. Calling on God supposesknowledge of him, faith in him, desire toward him, dependence on him,and, as evidence of the sincerity of all this, conscientious obedienceto him. Those only shall be delivered in the great day, who are noweffectually called from sin to God, from self to Christ, from thingsbelow to things above.
Joe 3:	<b>Overview</b><br>God's judgments in the latter days. (Joel 3:1-8) The extent of thesejudgments. (Joel 3:9-17) The blessings the church shall enjoy. (Joel3:18-21)<br>Joel 3:1-8 The restoration of the Jews, and the final victory of truereligion over all opposers, appear to be here foretold. The contemptand scorn with which the Jews have often been treated as a people, andthe little value set upon them, are noticed. None ever hardened hisheart against God or his church, and prospered long.<br>Joel 3:9-17 Here is a challenge to all the enemies of God's people.There is no escaping God's judgments; hardened sinners, in that day ofwrath, shall be cut off from all comfort and joy. Most of the prophetsforetell the same final victory of the church of God over all thatoppose it. To the wicked it will be a terrible day, but to therighteous it will be a joyful day. What cause have those who possess aninterest in Christ, to glory in their Strength and their Redeemer! Theacceptable year of the Lord, a day of such great favour to some, willbe a day of remarkable vengeance to others: let every one that is outof Christ awake, and flee from the wrath to come.<br>Joel 3:18-21 There shall be abundant Divine influences, and the gospelwill spread speedily into the remotest corners of the earth. Theseevents are predicted under significant emblems; there is a day coming,when every thing amiss shall be amended. The fountain of this plenty isin the house of God, whence the streams take rise. Christ is thisFountain; his sufferings, merit, and grace, cleanse, refresh, and makefruitful. Gospel grace, flowing from Christ, shall reach to the Gentileworld, to the most remote regions, and make them abound in fruits ofrighteousness; and from the house of the Lord above, from his heavenlytemple, flows all the good we daily taste, and hope to enjoy eternally.

Judgments are denouncedagainst the neighbouring nations, the oppressors of God's people. Thenumber of transgressions does not here mean that exact number, butmany: they had filled the measure of their sins, and were ripe forvengeance. The method in dealing with these nations is, in part, thesame, yet in each there is something peculiar. In all ages thisbitterness has been shown against the Lord's people.

Gen 1:1,2	<br>The first verse of the Bible gives us a satisfying and useful accountof the origin of the earth and the heavens. The faith of humbleChristians understands this better than the fancy of the most learnedmen. From what we see of heaven and earth, we learn the power of thegreat Creator. And let our make and place as men, remind us of our dutyas Christians, always to keep heaven in our eye, and the earth underour feet. The Son of God, one with the Father, was with him when hemade the world; nay, we are often told that the world was made by him,and nothing was made without him. Oh, what high thoughts should therebe in our minds, of that great God whom we worship, and of that greatMediator in whose name we pray! And here, at the beginning of thesacred volume, we read of that Divine Spirit, whose work upon the heartof man is so often mentioned in other parts of the Bible. Observe, thatat first there was nothing desirable to be seen, for the world waswithout form, and void; it was confusion, and emptiness. In like mannerthe work of grace in the soul is a new creation: and in a gracelesssoul, one that is not born again, there is disorder, confusion, andevery evil work: it is empty of all good, for it is without God; it isdark, it is darkness itself: this is our condition by nature, tillAlmighty grace works a change in us.
Gen 1:3-5	<br>God said, Let there be light; he willed it, and at once there waslight. Oh, the power of the word of God! And in the new creation, thefirst thing that is wrought in the soul is light: the blessed Spiritworks upon the will and affections by enlightening the understanding.Those who by sin were darkness, by grace become light in the Lord.Darkness would have been always upon fallen man, if the Son of God hadnot come and given us understanding, 1Jo 5:20. The light which Godwilled, he approved of. God divided the light from the darkness; forwhat fellowship has light with darkness? In heaven there is perfectlight, and no darkness at all; in hell, utter darkness, and no gleam oflight. The day and the night are the Lord's; let us use both to hishonour, by working for him every day, and resting in him every night,meditating in his law both day and night.
Gen 1:6-13	<br>The earth was emptiness, but by a word spoken, it became full of God'sriches, and his they are still. Though the use of them is allowed toman, they are from God, and to his service and honour they must beused. The earth, at his command, brings forth grass, herbs, and fruits.God must have the glory of all the benefit we receive from the produceof the earth. If we have, through grace, an interest in Him who is theFountain, we may rejoice in him when the streams of temporal merciesare dried up.
Gen 1:14-19	<br>In the fourth day's work, the creation of the sun, moon, and stars isaccounted for. All these are the works of God. The stars are spoken ofas they appear to our eyes, without telling their number, nature,place, size, or motions; for the Scriptures were written, not togratify curiosity, or make us astronomers, but to lead us to God, andmake us saints. The lights of heaven are made to serve him; they do itfaithfully, and shine in their season without fail. We are set aslights in this world to serve God; but do we in like manner answer theend of our creation? We do not: our light does not shine before God, ashis lights shine before us. We burn our Master's candles, but do notmind our Master's work.
Gen 1:20-25	<br>God commanded the fish and fowl to be produced. This command he himselfexecuted. Insects, which are more numerous than the birds and beasts,and as curious, seem to have been part of this day's work. TheCreator's wisdom and power are to be admired as much in an ant as in anelephant. The power of God's providence preserves all things, andfruitfulness is the effect of his blessing.
Gen 1:26-28	<br>Man was made last of all the creatures: this was both an honour and afavour to him. Yet man was made the same day that the beasts were; hisbody was made of the same earth with theirs; and while he is in thebody, he inhabits the same earth with them. God forbid that byindulging the body, and the desires of it, we should make ourselveslike the beasts that perish! Man was to be a creature different fromall that had been hitherto made. Flesh and spirit, heaven and earth,must be put together in him. God said, "Let us make man." Man, when hewas made, was to glorify the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. Into thatgreat name we are baptized, for to that great name we owe our being. Itis the soul of man that especially bears God's image. Man was madeupright, Ec 7:29. His understanding saw Divine things clearly andtruly; there were no errors or mistakes in his knowledge; his willconsented at once, and in all things, to the will of God. Hisaffections were all regular, and he had no bad appetites or passions.His thoughts were easily brought and fixed to the best subjects. Thusholy, thus happy, were our first parents in having the image of Godupon them. But how is this image of God upon man defaced! May the Lordrenew it upon our souls by his grace!
Gen 1:29,30	<br>Herbs and fruits must be man's food, including corn, and all theproducts of the earth. Let God's people cast their care upon him, andnot be troubled about what they shall eat, and what they shall drink.He that feeds his birds will not starve his babes.<br>Verse 31<br>When we come to think about our works, we find, to our shame, that muchhas been very bad; but when God saw his work, all was very good. Good,for it was all just as the Creator would have it to be. All his works,in all places of his dominion, bless him; and therefore, bless thou theLord, O my soul. Let us bless God for the gospel of Christ, and when weconsider his almighty power, let us sinners flee from the wrath tocome. If new--created unto the image of God in holiness, we shall atlength enter the "new heavens and new earth, wherein dwellethrighteousness."
Gen 2:1-3	<br>After six days, God ceased from all works of creation. In miracles, hehas overruled nature, but never changed its settled course, or added toit. God did not rest as one weary, but as one well pleased. Notice thebeginning of the kingdom of grace, in the sanctification, or keepingholy, of the sabbath day. The solemn observing of one day in seven as aday of holy rest and holy work, to God's honour, is the duty of all towhom God has made known his holy sabbaths. At this time none of thehuman race were in being but our first parents. For them the sabbathwas appointed; and clearly for all succeeding generations also. TheChristian sabbath, which we observe, is a seventh day, and in it wecelebrate the rest of God the Son, and the finishing the work of ourredemption.
Gen 2:4-7	<br>Here is a name given to the Creator, "Jehovah." Where the word "LORD"is printed in capital letters in our English Bibles, in the original itis "Jehovah." Jehovah is that name of God, which denotes that he alonehas his being of himself, and that he gives being to all creatures andthings. Further notice is taken of plants and herbs, because they weremade and appointed to be food for man. The earth did not bring forthits fruits of itself: this was done by Almighty power. Thus grace inthe soul grows not of itself in nature's soil, but is the work of God.Rain also is the gift of God; it came not till the Lord God caused it.Though God works by means, yet when he pleases he can do his own workwithout them; and though we must not tempt God in the neglect of means,we must trust God, both in the use and in the want of means. Some wayor other, God will water the plants of his own planting. Divine gracecomes down like the dew, and waters the church without noise. Man wasmade of the small dust, such as is on the surface of the earth. Thesoul was not made of the earth, as the body: pity then that it shouldcleave to the earth, and mind earthly things. To God we must shortlygive an account, how we have employed these souls; and if it be foundthat we have lost them, though it were to gain the world, we are undonefor ever! Fools despise their own souls, by caring for their bodiesbefore their souls.
Gen 2:8-14	<br>The place fixed upon for Adam to dwell in, was not a palace, but agarden. The better we take up with plain things, and the less we seekthings to gratify pride and luxury, the nearer we approach toinnocency. Nature is content with a little, and that which is mostnatural; grace with less; but lust craves every thing, and is contentwith nothing. No delights can be satisfying to the soul, but thosewhich God himself has provided and appointed for it. Eden signifiesdelight and pleasure. Wherever it was, it had all desirableconveniences, without any inconvenience, though no other house orgarden on earth ever was so. It was adorned with every tree pleasant tothe sight, and enriched with every tree that yielded fruit grateful tothe taste and good for food. God, as a tender Father, desired not onlyAdam's profit, but his pleasure; for there is pleasure with innocency,nay there is true pleasure only in innocency. When Providence puts usin a place of plenty and pleasure, we ought to serve God with gladnessof heart in the good things he gives us. Eden had two trees peculiar toitself. 1. There was the tree of life in the midst of the garden. Ofthis man might eat and live. Christ is now to us the Tree of life, Re2:7; 22:2; and the Bread of life, Joh 6:48,51. 2. There was the treeof the knowledge of good and evil, so called because there was apositive revelation of the will of God about this tree, so that by itman might know moral good and evil. What is good? It is good not to eatof this tree. What is evil? It is evil to eat of this tree. In thesetwo trees God set before Adam good and evil, the blessing and thecurse.<br>Verse 15<br>After God had formed Adam, he put him in the garden. All boasting wasthereby shut out. Only he that made us can make us happy; he that isthe Former of our bodies, and the Father of our spirits, and none buthe, can fully provide for the happiness of both. Even in paradiseitself man had to work. None of us were sent into the world to be idle.He that made our souls and bodies, has given us something to work with;and he that gave us this earth for our habitation, has made ussomething to work upon. The sons and heirs of heaven, while in thisworld, have something to do about this earth, which must have its shareof their time and thoughts; and if they do it with an eye to God, theyas truly serve him in it, as when they are upon their knees. Observethat the husbandman's calling is an ancient and honourable calling; itwas needful even in paradise. Also, there is true pleasure in thebusiness God calls us to, and employs us in. Adam could not have beenhappy if he had been idle: it is still God's law, He that will not workhas no right to eat, 2Th 3:10.
Gen 2:16,17	<br>Let us never set up our own will against the holy will of God. Therewas not only liberty allowed to man, in taking the fruits of paradise,but everlasting life made sure to him upon his obedience. There was atrial appointed of his obedience. By transgression he would forfeit hisMaker's favour, and deserve his displeasure, with all its awfuleffects; so that he would become liable to pain, disease, and death.Worse than that, he would lose the holy image of God, and all thecomfort of his favour; and feel the torment of sinful passions, and theterror of his Maker's vengeance, which must endure for ever with hisnever dying soul. The forbidding to eat of the fruit of a particulartree was wisely suited to the state of our first parents. In theirstate of innocence, and separated from any others, what opportunity orwhat temptation had they to break any of the ten commandments? Theevent proves that the whole human race were concerned in the trial andfall of our first parents. To argue against these things is to striveagainst stubborn facts, as well as Divine revelation; for man issinful, and shows by his first actions, and his conduct everafterwards, that he is ready to do evil. He is under the Divinedispleasure, exposed to sufferings and death. The Scriptures alwaysspeak of man as of this sinful character, and in this miserable state;and these things are true of men in all ages, and of all nations.
Gen 2:18-25	<br>Power over the creatures was given to man, and as a proof of this henamed them all. It also shows his insight into the works of God. Butthough he was lord of the creatures, yet nothing in this world was ahelp meet for man. From God are all our helpers. If we rest in God, hewill work all for good. God caused deep sleep to fall on Adam; while heknows no sin, God will take care that he shall feel no pain. God, asher Father, brought the woman to the man, as his second self, and ahelp meet for him. That wife, who is of God's making by special grace,and of God's bringing by special providence, is likely to prove a helpmeet for a man. See what need there is, both of prudence and prayer inthe choice of this relation, which is so near and so lasting. That hadneed to be well done, which is to be done for life. Our first parentsneeded no clothes for covering against cold or heat, for neither couldhurt them: they needed none for ornament. Thus easy, thus happy, wasman in his state of innocency. How good was God to him! How manyfavours did he load him with! How easy were the laws given to him! Yetman, being in honour, understood not his own interest, but soon becameas the beasts that perish.
Gen 3:1-5	<br>Satan assaulted our first parents, to draw them to sin, and thetemptation proved fatal to them. The tempter was the devil, in theshape and likeness of a serpent. Satan's plan was to draw our firstparents to sin, and so to separate between them and their God. Thus thedevil was from the beginning a murderer, and the great mischief maker.The person tempted was the woman: it was Satan's policy to enter intotalk with her when she was alone. There are many temptations to whichbeing alone gives great advantage; but the communion of saints tendsvery much to their strength and safety. Satan took advantage by findingher near the forbidden tree. They that would not eat the forbiddenfruit, must not come near the forbidden tree. Satan tempted Eve, thatby her he might tempt Adam. It is his policy to send temptations byhands we do not suspect, and by those that have most influence upon us.Satan questioned whether it were a sin or not, to eat of this tree. Hedid not disclose his design at first, but he put a question whichseemed innocent. Those who would be safe, need to be shy of talkingwith the tempter. He quoted the command wrong. He spoke in a tauntingway. The devil, as he is a liar, so he is a scoffer from the beginning;and scoffers are his children. It is the craft of Satan to speak of theDivine law as uncertain or unreasonable, and so to draw people to sin;it is our wisdom to keep up a firm belief of God's command, and a highrespect for it. Has God said, Ye shall not lie, nor take his name invain, nor be drunk, &c.? Yes, I am sure he has, and it is well said;and by his grace I will abide by it. It was Eve's weakness to enterinto this talk with the serpent: she might have perceived by hisquestion, that he had no good design, and should therefore have startedback. Satan teaches men first to doubt, and then to deny. He promisesadvantage from their eating this fruit. He aims to make themdiscontented with their present state, as if it were not so good as itmight be, and should be. No condition will of itself bring content,unless the mind be brought to it. He tempts them to seek preferment, asif they were fit to be gods. Satan ruined himself by desiring to belike the Most High, therefore he sought to infect our first parentswith the same desire, that he might ruin them too. And still the devildraws people into his interest, by suggesting to them hard thoughts ofGod, and false hopes of advantage by sin. Let us, therefore, alwaysthink well of God as the best good, and think ill of sin as the worstevil: thus let us resist the devil, and he will flee from us.
Gen 3:6-8	<br>Observe the steps of the transgression: not steps upward, but downwardtoward the pit. 1. She saw. A great deal of sin comes in at the eye.Let us not look on that which we are in danger of lusting after, Mt5:28. 2. She took. It was her own act and deed. Satan may tempt, but hecannot force; may persuade us to cast ourselves down, but he cannotcast us down, Mt 4:6. 3. She did eat. When she looked perhaps she didnot intend to take; or when she took, not to eat: but it ended in that.It is wisdom to stop the first motions of sin, and to leave it offbefore it be meddled with. 4. She gave it also to her husband with her.Those that have done ill, are willing to draw in others to do the same.5. He did eat. In neglecting the tree of life, of which he was allowedto eat, and eating of the tree of knowledge, which was forbidden, Adamplainly showed a contempt of what God had bestowed on him, and a desirefor what God did not see fit to give him. He would have what hepleased, and do what he pleased. His sin was, in one word,disobedience, Ro 5:19; disobedience to a plain, easy, and expresscommand. He had no corrupt nature within, to betray him; but had afreedom of will, in full strength, not weakened or impaired. He turnedaside quickly. He drew all his posterity into sin and ruin. Who thencan say that Adam's sin had but little harm in it? When too late, Adamand Eve saw the folly of eating forbidden fruit. They saw the happinessthey fell from, and the misery they were fallen into. They saw a lovingGod provoked, his grace and favour forfeited. See her what dishonourand trouble sin is; it makes mischief wherever it gets in, and destroysall comfort. Sooner or later it will bring shame; either the shame oftrue repentance, which ends in glory, or that shame and everlastingcontempt, to which the wicked shall rise at the great day. See herewhat is commonly the folly of those that have sinned. They have morecare to save their credit before men, than to obtain their pardon fromGod. The excuses men make to cover and lessen their sins, are vain andfrivolous; like the aprons of fig-leaves, they make the matter neverthe better: yet we are all apt to cover our transgressions as Adam.Before they sinned, they would have welcomed God's gracious visits withhumble joy; but now he was become a terror to them. No marvel that theybecame a terror to themselves, and full of confusion. This shows thefalsehood of the tempter, and the frauds of his temptations. Satanpromised they should be safe, but they cannot so much as thinkthemselves so! Adam and Eve were now miserable comforters to eachother!
Gen 3:9-13	<br>Observe the startling question, Adam, where art thou? Those who by singo astray from God, should seriously consider where they are; they areafar off from all good, in the midst of their enemies, in bondage toSatan, and in the high road to utter ruin. This lost sheep had wanderedwithout end, if the good Shepherd had not sought after him, and toldhim, that where he was straying he could not be either happy or easy.If sinners will but consider where they are, they will not rest tillthey return to God. It is the common fault and folly of those that havedone ill, when questioned about it, to acknowledge only that which isso manifest that they cannot deny it. Like Adam, we have reason to beafraid of approaching to God, if we are not covered and clothed withthe righteousness of Christ. Sin appears most plainly in the glass ofthe commandment, therefore God set it before Adam; and in it we shouldsee our faces. But instead of acknowledging the sin in its full extent,and taking shame to themselves, Adam and Eve excuse the sin, and laythe shame and blame on others. There is a strange proneness in thosethat are tempted, to say, they are tempted of God; as if our abuse ofGod's gifts would excuse our breaking God's laws. Those who are willingto take the pleasure and profit of sin, are backward to take the blameand shame of it. Learn hence, that Satan's temptations are allbeguilings; his arguments are all deceits; his allurements are allcheats; when he speaks fair, believe him not. It is by thedeceitfulness of sin the heart is hardened. See Ro 7:11; Heb 3:13. Butthough Satan's subtlety may draw us into sin, yet it will not justifyus in sin. Though he is the tempter, we are the sinners. Let it notlessen our sorrow for sin, that we were beguiled into it; but let itincrease our self-indignation, that we should suffer ourselves to bedeceived by a known cheat, and a sworn enemy, who would destroy oursouls.
Gen 3:14,15	<br>God passes sentence; and he begins where the sin began, with theserpent. The devil's instruments must share in the devil's punishments.Under the cover of the serpent, the devil is sentenced to be degradedand accursed of God; detested and abhorred of all mankind: also to bedestroyed and ruined at last by the great Redeemer, signified by thebreaking of his head. War is proclaimed between the Seed of the womanand the seed of the serpent. It is the fruit of this enmity, that thereis a continual warfare between grace and corruption, in the hearts ofGod's people. Satan, by their corruptions, buffets them, sifts them,and seeks to devour them. Heaven and hell can never be reconciled, norlight and darkness; no more can Satan and a sanctified soul. Also,there is a continual struggle between the wicked and the godly in thisworld. A gracious promise is here made of Christ, as the Deliverer offallen man from the power of Satan. Here was the drawn of the gospelday: no sooner was the wound given, than the remedy was provided andrevealed. This gracious revelation of a Saviour came unasked, andunlooked for. Without a revelation of mercy, giving some hope offorgiveness, the convinced sinner would sink into despair, and behardened. By faith in this promise, our first parents, and thepatriarchs before the flood, were justified and saved. Notice is givenconcerning Christ. 1. His incarnation, or coming in the flesh. Itspeaks great encouragement to sinners, that their Saviour is the Seedof the woman, bone of our bone, Heb 2:11,14. 2. His sufferings anddeath; pointed at in Satan's bruising his heel, that is, his humannature. And Christ's sufferings are continued in the sufferings of thesaints for his name. The devil tempts them, persecutes and slays them;and so bruises the heel of Christ, who is afflicted in theirafflictions. But while the heel is bruised on earth, the Head is inheaven. 3. His victory over Satan thereby. Christ baffled Satan'stemptations, rescued souls out of his hands. By his death he gave afatal blow to the devil's kingdom, a wound to the head of this serpentthat cannot be healed. As the gospel gains ground, Satan falls.
Gen 3:16-19	<br>The woman, for her sin, is condemned to a state of sorrow, and ofsubjection; proper punishments of that sin, in which she had sought togratify the desire of her eye, and of the flesh, and her pride. Sinbrought sorrow into the world; that made the world a vale of tears. Nowonder our sorrows are multiplied, when our sins are so. He shall ruleover thee, is but God's command, Wives, be subject to your ownhusbands. If man had not sinned, he would always have ruled with wisdomand love; if the woman had not sinned, she would always have obeyedwith humility and meekness. Adam laid the blame on his wife; but thoughit was her fault to persuade him to eat the forbidden fruit, it was hisfault to hearken to her. Thus men's frivolous pleas will, in the day ofGod's judgment, be turned against them. God put marks of displeasure onAdam. 1. His habitation is cursed. God gave the earth to the childrenof men, to be a comfortable dwelling; but it is now cursed for man'ssin. Yet Adam is not himself cursed, as the serpent was, but only theground for his sake. 2. His employments and enjoyments are imbitteredto him. Labour is our duty, which we must faithfully perform; it ispart of man's sentence, which idleness daringly defies. Uneasiness andweariness with labour are our just punishment, which we must patientlysubmit to, since they are less than our iniquity deserves. Man's foodshall become unpleasant to him. Yet man is not sentenced to eat dust asthe serpent, only to eat the herb of the field. 3. His life also is butshort; considering how full of trouble his days are, it is in favour tohim that they are few. Yet death being dreadful to nature, even whenlife is unpleasant, that concludes the punishment. Sin brought deathinto the world: if Adam had not sinned, he had not died. He gave way totemptation, but the Saviour withstood it. And how admirably thesatisfaction of our Lord Jesus, by his death and sufferings, answeredthe sentence passed on our first parents! Did travailing pains comewith sin? We read of the travail of Christ's soul, Isa 53:11; and thepains of death he was held by, are so called, Ac 2:24. Did subjectioncame in with sin? Christ was made under the law, Ga 4:4. Did the cursecome in with sin? Christ was made a curse for us, he died a curseddeath, Ga 3:13. Did thorns come in with sin? He was crowned with thornsfor us. Did sweat come in with sin? He sweat for us, as it had beengreat drops of blood. Did sorrow come in with sin? He was a man ofsorrows; his soul was, in his agony, exceeding sorrowful. Did deathcome in with sin? He became obedient unto death. Thus is the plaster aswide as the wound. Blessed be God for his Son our Lord Jesus Christ.
Gen 3:20,21	<br>God named the man, and called him Adam, which signifies red earth; Adamnamed the woman, and called her Eve, that is, life. Adam bears the nameof the dying body, Eve of the living soul. Adam probably had regard tothe blessing of a Redeemer, the promised Seed, in calling his wife Eve,or life; for He should be the life of all believers, and in Him all thefamilies of the earth should be blessed. See also God's care for ourfirst parents, notwithstanding their sin. Clothes came in with sin.Little reason have we to be proud of our clothes, which are but thebadges of our shame. When God made clothes for our first parents, hemade them warm and strong, but coarse and very plain; not robes ofscarlet, but coats of skin. Let those that are meanly clad, learn fromhence not to complain. Having food and a covering, let them be content;they are as well off as Adam and Eve. And let those that are finelyclad, learn not to make the putting on of apparel their adorning. Thebeasts, from whose skins they were clothed, it is supposed were slain,not for man's food, but for sacrifice, to typify Christ, the greatSacrifice. Adam and Eve made for themselves aprons of fig-leaves, acovering too narrow for them to wrap themselves in, Isa 28:20. Such areall the rags of our own righteousness. But God made them coats of skin,large, strong, durable, and fit for them: such is the righteousness ofChrist; therefore put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ.
Gen 3:22-24	<br>God bid man go out; told him he should no longer occupy and enjoy thatgarden: but man liked the place, and was unwilling to leave it,therefore God made him go out. This signified the shutting out of him,and all his guilty race, from that communion with God, which was thebliss and glory of paradise. But man was only sent to till the groundout of which he was taken. He was sent to a place of toil, not to aplace of torment. Our first parents were shut out from the privilegesof their state of innocency, yet they were not left to despair. The wayto the tree of life was shut. It was henceforward in vain for him andhis to expect righteousness, life, and happiness, by the covenant ofworks; for the command of that covenant being broken, the curse of itis in full force: we are all undone, if we are judged by that covenant.God revealed this to Adam, not to drive him to despair, but to quickenhim to look for life and happiness in the promised Seed, by whom a newand living way into the holiest is laid open for us.
Gen 4:1-7	<br>When Cain was born, Eve said, I have gotten a man from the Lord.Perhaps she thought that this was the promised seed. If so, she waswofully disappointed. Abel signifies vanity: when she thought she hadthe promised seed in Cain, whose name signifies possession, she was sotaken up with him that another son was as vanity to her. Observe, eachson had a calling. It is the will of God for every one to havesomething to do in this world. Parents ought to bring up their childrento work. Give them a Bible and a calling, said good Mr. Dod, and God bewith them. We may believe that God commanded Adam, after the fall, toshed the blood of innocent animals, and after their death to burn partor the whole of their bodies by fire. Thus that punishment whichsinners deserve, even the death of the body, and the wrath of God, ofwhich fire is a well-known emblem, and also the sufferings of Christ,were prefigured. Observe that the religious worship of God is no newinvention. It was from the beginning; it is the good old way, Jer 6:16.The offerings of Cain and Abel were different. Cain showed a proud,unbelieving heart. Therefore he and his offering were rejected. Abelcame as a sinner, and according to God's appointment, by his sacrificeexpressing humility, sincerity, and believing obedience. Thus, seekingthe benefit of the new covenant of mercy, through the promised Seed,his sacrifice had a token that God accepted it. Abel offered in faith,and Cain did not, Heb 11:4. In all ages there have been two sorts ofworshippers, such as Cain and Abel; namely, proud, hardened despisersof the gospel method of salvation, who attempt to please God in ways oftheir own devising; and humble believers, who draw near to him in theway he has revealed. Cain indulged malignant anger against Abel. Heharboured an evil spirit of discontent and rebellion against God. Godnotices all our sinful passions and discontents. There is not an angry,envious, or fretful look, that escapes his observing eye. The Lordreasoned with this rebellious man; if he came in the right way, heshould be accepted. Some understand this as an intimation of mercy. "Ifthou doest not well, sin, that is, the sin-offering, lies at the door,and thou mayest take the benefit of it." The same word signifies sin,and a sacrifice for sin. "Though thou hast not done well, yet do notdespair; the remedy is at hand." Christ, the great sin-offering, issaid to stand at the door, Re 3:20. And those well deserve to perish intheir sins, that will not go to the door to ask for the benefit of thissin-offering. God's acceptance of Abel's offering did not change thebirthright, and make it his; why then should Cain be so angry? Sinfulheats and disquiets vanish before a strict and fair inquiry into thecause.
Gen 4:8-15	<br>Malice in the heart ends in murder by the hands. Cain slew Abel, hisown brother, his own mother's son, whom he ought to have loved; hisyounger brother, whom he ought to have protected; a good brother, whohad never done him any wrong. What fatal effects were these of ourfirst parents' sin, and how must their hearts have been filled withanguish! Observe the pride, unbelief, and impenitence of Cain. Hedenies the crime, as if he could conceal it from God. He tries to covera deliberate murder with a deliberate lie. Murder is a crying sin.Blood calls for blood, the blood of the murdered for the blood of themurderer. Who knows the extent and weight of a Divine curse, how far itreaches, how deep it pierces? Only in Christ are believers saved fromit, and inherit the blessing. Cain was cursed from the earth. He foundhis punishment there where he chose his portion, and set his heart.Every creature is to us what God makes it, a comfort or a cross, ablessing or a curse. The wickedness of the wicked brings a curse uponall they do, and all they have. Cain complains not of his sin, but ofhis punishment. It shows great hardness of heart to be more concernedabout our sufferings than our sins. God has wise and holy ends inprolonging the lives even of very wicked men. It is in vain to inquirewhat was the mark set upon Cain. It was doubtless known, both as abrand of infamy on Cain, and a token from God that they should not killhim. Abel, being dead, yet speaketh. He tells the heinous guilt ofmurder, and warns us to stifle the first risings of wrath, and teachesus that persecution must be expected by the righteous. Also, that thereis a future state, and an eternal recompence to be enjoyed, throughfaith in Christ and his atoning sacrifice. And he tells us theexcellency of faith in the atoning sacrifice and blood of the Lamb ofGod. Cain slew his brother, because his own works were evil, and hisbrother's righteous, 1Jo 3:12. In consequence of the enmity put betweenthe Seed of the woman and the seed of the serpent, the war broke out,which has been waged ever since. In this war we are all concerned, noneare neuter; our Captain has declared, He that is not with me is againstme. Let us decidedly, yet in meekness, support the cause of truth andrighteousness against Satan.
Gen 4:16-18	<br>Cain cast off all fear of God, and attended no more on God'sordinances. Hypocritical professors, who dissemble and trifle with God,are justly left to themselves to do something grossly scandalous. Sothey throw off that form of godliness to which they have been areproach, and of which they deny the power. Cain went out from thepresence of the Lord, and we never find that he came into it again, tohis comfort. The land Cain dwelt in was called the land of Nod, whichmeans, shaking,' or trembling,' and so shows the restlessness anduneasiness of his own spirit, or the land of a vagabond:' they thatdepart from God cannot find rest any where else. Those on earth wholooked for the heavenly city, chose to dwell in tabernacles or tents;but Cain, as not minding that city, built one on earth. Thus all whoare cursed of God seek their settlement and satisfaction here below.
Gen 4:19-24	<br>One of Cain's wicked race is the first recorded, as having broken thelaw of marriage. Hitherto, one man had but one wife at a time; butLamech took two. Wordly things, are the only things that carnal, wickedpeople set their hearts upon, and are most clever and industriousabout. So it was with this race of Cain. Here was a father ofshepherds, and a father of musicians, but not a father of the faithful.Here is one to teach about brass and iron, but none to teach the goodknowledge of the Lord: here are devices how to be rich, and how to bemighty, and how to be merry; but nothing of God, of his fear andservice. Present things fill the heads of most. Lamech had enemies,whom he had provoked. He draws a comparison betwixt himself and hisancestor Cain; and flatters himself that he is much less criminal. Heseems to abuse the patience of God in sparing Cain, into anencouragement to expect that he may sin unpunished.
Gen 4:25,26	<br>Our first parents were comforted in their affliction by the birth of ason, whom they called Seth, that is, set,' settled,' or placed;' in hisseed mankind should continue to the end of time, and from him theMessiah should descend. While Cain, the head of the apostacy, is made awanderer, Seth, from whom the true church was to come, is one fixed. InChrist and his church is the only true settlement. Seth walked in thesteps of his martyred brother Abel; he was a partaker of like preciousfaith in the righteousness of our God and Saviour Jesus Christ, and sobecame a fresh witness of the grace and influence of God the HolySpirit. God gave Adam and Eve to see the revival of religion in theirfamily. The worshippers of God began to do more in religion; some, byan open profession of true religion, protested against the wickednessof the world around. The worse others are, the better we should be, andthe more zealous. Then began the distinction between professors andprofane, which has been kept up ever since, and will be, while theworld stands.
Gen 5:1-5	<br>Adam was made in the image of God; but when fallen he begat a son inhis own image, sinful and defiled, frail, wretched, and mortal, likehimself. Not only a man like himself, consisting of body and soul, buta sinner like himself. This was the reverse of that Divine likeness inwhich Adam was made; having lost it, he could not convey it to hisseed. Adam lived, in all, 930 years; and then died, according to thesentence passed upon him, "To dust thou shalt return." Though he didnot die in the day he ate forbidden fruit, yet in that very day hebecame mortal. Then he began to die; his whole life after was but areprieve, a forfeited, condemned life; it was a wasting, dying life.Man's life is but dying by degrees.
Gen 5:6-20	<br>Concerning each of these, except Enoch, it is said, "and he died." Itis well to observe the deaths of others. They all lived very long; notone of them died till he had seen almost eight hundred years, and someof them lived much longer; a great while for an immortal soul to beprisoned in a house of clay. The present life surely was not to themsuch a burden as it commonly is now, else they would have been weary ofit. Nor was the future life so clearly revealed then, as it now underthe gospel, else they would have been urgent to remove to it. All thepatriarchs that lived before the flood, except Noah, were born beforeAdam died. From him they might receive a full account of the creation,the fall, the promise, and the Divine precepts about religious worshipand a religious life. Thus God kept up in his church the knowledge ofhis will.
Gen 5:21-24	<br>Enoch was the seventh from Adam. Godliness is walking with God: whichshows reconciliation to God, for two cannot walk together except theybe agreed, Am 3:3. It includes all the parts of a godly, righteous, andsober life. To walk with God, is to set God always before us, to act asalways under his eye. It is constantly to care, in all things to pleaseGod, and in nothing to offend him. It is to be followers of him as dearchildren. The Holy Spirit, instead of saying, Enoch lived, says, Enochwalked with God. This was his constant care and work; while otherslived to themselves and the world, he lived to God. It was the joy ofhis life. Enoch was removed to a better world. As he did not live likethe rest of mankind, so he did not leave the world by death as theydid. He was not found, because God had translated him, Heb 11:5. He hadlived but 365 years, which, as men's ages were then, was but the midstof a man's days. God often takes those soonest whom he loves best; thetime they lose on earth, is gained in heaven, to their unspeakableadvantage. See how Enoch's removal is expressed: he was not, for Godtook him. He was not any longer in this world; he was changed, as thesaints shall be, who are alive at Christ's second coming. Those whobegin to walk with God when young, may expect to walk with him long,comfortably, and usefully. The true christian's steady walk inholiness, through many a year, till God takes him, will best recommendthat religion which many oppose and many abuse. And walking with Godwell agrees with the cares, comforts, and duties of life.
Gen 5:25-32	<br>Methuselah signifies, he dies, there is a dart,' a sending forth,'namely, of the deluge, which came the year that Methuselah died. Helived 969 years, the longest that any man ever lived on earth; but thelongest liver must die at last. Noah signifies rest; his parents gavehim that name, with a prospect of his being a great blessing to hisgeneration. Observe his father's complaint of the calamitous state ofhuman life, by the entrance of sin, and the curse of sin. Our wholelife is spent in labour, and our time filled up with continual toil.God having cursed the ground, it is as much as some can do, with theutmost care and pains, to get a hard livelihood out comfort us." Itsignifies not only that desire and expectation which parents generallyhave about their children, that they will be comforts to them andhelpers, though they often prove otherwise; but it signifies also aprospect of something more. Is Christ ours? Is heaven ours? We needbetter comforters under our toil and sorrow, than the dearest relationsand the most promising offspring; may we seek and find comforts inChrist.
Gen 6:1-7	<br>The most remarkable thing concerning the old world, is the destroyingof it by the deluge, or flood. We are told of the abounding iniquity ofthat wicked world: God's just wrath, and his holy resolution to punishit. In all ages there has been a peculiar curse of God upon marriagesbetween professors of true religion and its avowed enemies. The evilexample of the ungodly party corrupts or greatly hurts the other.Family religion is put an end to, and the children are trained upaccording to the worldly maxims of that parent who is without the fearof God. If we profess to be the sons and daughters of the LordAlmighty, we must not marry without his consent. He will never give hisblessing, if we prefer beauty, wit, wealth, or worldly honours, tofaith and holiness. The Spirit of God strove with men, by sendingEnoch, Noah, and perhaps others, to preach to them; by waiting to begracious, notwithstanding their rebellions; and by exciting alarm andconvictions in their consciences. But the Lord declared that his Spiritshould not thus strive with men always; he would leave them to behardened in sin, and ripened for destruction. This he determined on,because man was flesh: not only frail and feeble, but carnal anddepraved; having misused the noble powers of his soul to gratify hiscorrupt inclinations. God sees all the wickedness that is among thechildren of men; it cannot be hid from him now; and if it be notrepented of, it shall be made known by him shortly. The wickedness of apeople is great indeed, when noted sinners are men renowned among them.Very much sin was committed in all places, by all sorts of people. Anyone might see that the wickedness of man was great: but God saw thatevery imagination, or purpose, of the thoughts of man's heart, was onlyevil continually. This was the bitter root, the corrupt spring. Theheart was deceitful and desperately wicked; the principles werecorrupt; the habits and dispositions evil. Their designs and deviceswere wicked. They did evil deliberately, contriving how to do mischief.There was no good among them. God saw man's wickedness as one injuredand wronged by it. He saw it as a tender father sees the folly andstubbornness of a rebellious and disobedient child, which grieves him,and makes him wish he had been childless. The words here used areremarkable; they are used after the manner of men, and do not mean thatGod can change, or be unhappy. Does God thus hate our sin? And shallnot we be grieved to the heart for it? Oh that we may look on Him whomwe have grieved, and mourn! God repented that he had made man; but wenever find him repent that he redeemed man. God resolves to destroyman: the original word is very striking, I will wipe off man from theearth,' as dirt or filth is wiped off from a place which should beclean, and is thrown to the dunghill, the proper place for it. Godspeaks of man as his own creature, when he resolves upon hispunishment. Those forfeit their lives who do not answer the end oftheir living. God speaks of resolution concerning men, after his Spirithad been long striving with them in vain. None are punished by thejustice of God, but those who hate to be reformed by the grace of God.
Gen 6:8-11	<br>Noah did not find favour in the eyes of men; they hated and persecutedhim, because both by his life and preaching he condemned the world: buthe found grace in the eyes of the Lord, and this made him more trulyhonourable than the men of renown. Let this be our chief desire, let uslabour that we may be accepted of him. When the rest of the world waswicked, Noah kept his integrity. God's good-will towards Noah producedthis good work in him. He was a just man, that is, justified beforeGod, by faith in the promised Seed. As such he was made holy, and hadright principles; and was righteous in his conversation. He was notonly honest, but devout; it was his constant care to do the will ofGod. God looks down upon those with an eye of favour, who sincerelylook up to him with an eye of faith. It is easy to be religious whenreligion is in fashion; but it shows strong faith and resolution, toswim against the stream, and to appear for God when no one else appearsfor him; Noah did so. All kinds of sin were found among men. Theycorrupted God's worship. Sin fills the earth with violence, and thisfully justified God's resolution to destroy the world. The contagionspread. When wickedness is become general, ruin is not far off; whilethere is a remnant of praying people in a nation, to empty the measureas it fills, judgments may be long kept off; but when all hands are atwork to pull down the fences, by sin, and none stand in the gap to makeup the breach, what can be expected but a flood of wrath?
Gen 6:12-21	<br>God told Noah his purpose to destroy the wicked world by water. Thesecret of the Lord is with them that fear him, Ps 25:14. It is with allbelievers, enabling them to understand and apply the declarations andwarnings of the written word. God chose to do it by a flood of waters,which should drown the world. As he chooses the rod with which hecorrects his children, so he chooses the sword with which he cuts offhis enemies. God established his covenant with Noah. This is the firstplace in the Bible where the word covenant' is found; it seems to mean,1. The covenant of providence; that the course of nature shall becontinued to the end of time. 2. The covenant of grace; that God wouldbe a God to Noah, and that out of his seed God would take to himself apeople. God directed Noah to make an ark. This ark was like the hulk ofa ship, fitted to float upon the waters. It was very large, half thesize of St. Paul's cathedral, and would hold more than eighteen of thelargest ships now used. God could have secured Noah without putting himto any care, or pains, or trouble; but employed him in making thatwhich was to be the means to preserve him, for the trial of his faithand obedience. Both the providence of God, and the grace of God, ownand crown the obedient and diligent. God gave Noah particular ordershow to make the ark, which could not therefore but be well fitted forthe purpose. God promised Noah that he and his family should be keptalive in the ark. What we do in obedience to God, we and our familiesare likely to have the benefit of. The piety of parents gets theirchildren good in this life, and furthers them in the way to eternallife, if they improve it.<br>Verse 22<br>Noah's faith triumphed over all corrupt reasonings. To rear so large abuilding, such a one as he never saw, and to provide food for theliving creatures, would require from him a great deal of care, andlabour, and expense. His neighbours would laugh at him. But all suchobjections, Noah, by faith, got over; his obedience was ready andresolute. Having begun to build, he did not leave off till he hadfinished: so did he, and so must we do. He feared the deluge, andtherefore prepared the ark. And in the warning given to Noah, there isa more solemn warning given to us, to flee from the wrath to come,which will sweep the world of unbelievers into the pit of destruction.Christ, the true Noah, which same shall comfort us, hath by Hissufferings already prepared the ark, and kindly invites us by faith toenter in. While the day of his patience continues, let us hear and obeyhis voice.
Gen 7:1-12	<br>The call to Noah is very kind, like that of a tender father to hischildren to come in-doors when he sees night or a storm coming. Noahdid not go into the ark till God bade him, though he knew it was to behis place of refuge. It is very comfortable to see God going before usin every step we take. Noah had taken a great deal of pains to buildthe ark, and now he was himself kept alive in it. What we do inobedience to the command of God, and in faith, we ourselves shallcertainly have the comfort of, first or last. This call to Noah remindsus of the call the gospel gives to poor sinners. Christ is an ark, inwhom alone we can be safe, when death and judgment approach. The wordsays, "Come;" ministers say, "Come;" the Spirit says, "Come, come intothe Ark." Noah was accounted righteous, not for his own righteousness,but as an heir of the righteousness which is by faith, Heb 11:7. Hebelieved the revelation of a saviour, and sought and expected salvationthrough Him alone. Thus was he justified by faith, and received thatSpirit whose fruit is in all goodness; but if any man have not theSpirit of Christ, he is none of his. After the hundred and twentyyears, God granted seven days' longer space for repentance. But theseseven days were trifled away, like all the rest. It shall be but sevendays. They had only one week more, one sabbath more to improve, and toconsider the things that belonged to their peace. But it is common forthose who have been careless of their souls during the years of theirhealth, when they have looked upon death at a distance, to be ascareless during the days, the few days of their sickness, when they seedeath approaching; their hearts being hardened by the deceitfulness ofsin. As Noah prepared the ark by faith in the warning given that theflood would come, so he went into it, by faith in this warning that itwould come quickly. And on the day Noah was securely fixed in the ark,the fountains of the great deep were broken up. The earth had within itthose waters, which, at God's command, sprang up and flooded it; andthus our bodies have in themselves those humours, which, when Godpleases, become the seeds and springs of mortal diseases. The windowsof heaven were opened, and the waters which were above the firmament,that is, in the air, were poured out upon the earth. The rain comesdown in drops; but such rains fell then, as were never known before orsince. It rained without stop or abatement, forty days and fortynights, upon the whole earth at once. As there was a peculiar exerciseof the almighty power of God in causing the flood, it is vain andpresumptuous to attempt explaining the method of it, by human wisdom.
Gen 7:13-16	<br>The ravenous creatures were made mild and manageable; yet, when thisoccasion was over, they were of the same kind as before; for the arkdid not alter their natures. Hypocrites in the church, who outwardlyconform to the laws of that ark, are yet unchanged; and it will appear,one time or other, what kind they are after. God continued his care ofNoah. God shut the door, to secure him and keep him safe in the ark;also to keep all others for ever out. In what manner this was done, Godhas not been pleased to make known. There is much of our gospel dutyand privilege to be seen in Noah's safety in the ark. The apostle makesit a type of christian baptism, 1Pe 3:20,21. Observe then, it is ourgreat duty, in obedience to the gospel call, by a lively faith inChrist, to come into that way of salvation which God has provided forpoor sinners. Those that come into the ark, should bring as many asthey can with them, by good instructions, by persuasions, and by goodexamples. There is room enough in Christ for all comers. God put Adaminto paradise, but did not shut him in, so he threw himself out; butwhen God put Noah into the ark, and so when he brings a soul to Christ,the salvation is sure: it is not in our own keeping, but in theMediator's hand. But the door of mercy will shortly be shut againstthose that now make light of it. Knock now, and it shall be opened, Lu13:25.
Gen 7:17-20	<br>The flood was increasing forty days. The waters rose so high, that thetops of the highest mountains were overflowed more than twenty feet.There is no place on earth so high as to set men out of the reach ofGod's judgments. God's hand will find out all his enemies, Ps 21:8.When the flood thus increased, Noah's ark was lifted up, and the waterswhich broke down every thing else, bore up the ark. That which tounbelievers betokens death unto death, to the faithful betokens lifeunto life.
Gen 7:21-24	<br>All the men, women, and children, that were in the world, exceptingthose in the ark, died. We may easily imagine what terror seized them.Our Saviour tells us, that till the very day that the flood came, theywere eating and drinking, Lu 17:26,27; they were deaf and blind to allDivine warnings. In this posture death surprised them. They wereconvinced of their folly when it was too late. We may suppose theytried all ways and means possible to save themselves, but all in vain.And those that are not found in Christ, the Ark, are certainly undone,undone for ever. Let us pause, and consider this tremendous judgment!Who can stand before the Lord when he is angry? The sin of sinners willbe their ruin, first or last, if not repented of. The righteous Godknows how to bring ruin upon the world of the ungodly, 2Pe 2:5. Howtremendous will be the day of judgment and perdition of ungodly men!Happy they who are part of Christ's family, and safe with him as such;they may look forward without dismay, and rejoice that they shalltriumph, when fire shall burn up the earth, and all that therein is. Weare apt to suppose some favourable distinctions in our own case orcharacter; but if we neglect, refuse, or abuse the salvation of Christ,we shall, notwithstanding such fancied advantages, be destroyed in thecommon ruin of an unbelieving world.
Gen 8:1-3	<br>The whole race of mankind, except Noah and his family, were now dead,so that God's remembering Noah, was the return of his mercy to mankind,of whom he would not make a full end. The demands of Divine justice hadbeen answered by the ruin of sinners. God sent his wind to dry theearth, and seal up his waters. The same hand that brings thedesolation, must bring the deliverance; to that hand, therefore, wemust ever look. When afflictions have done the work for which they aresent, whether killing work or curing work, they will be taken away. Asthe earth was not drowned in a day, so it was not dried in a day. Godusually works deliverance for his people gradually, that the day ofsmall things may not be despised, nor the day of great things despairedof.
Gen 8:4-12	<br>The ark rested upon a mountain, whither it was directed by the wise andgracious providence of God, that might rest the sooner. God has timesand places of rest for his people after their tossing; and many timeshe provides for their seasonable and comfortable settlement, withouttheir own contrivance, and quite beyond their own foresight. God hadtold Noah when the flood would come, yet he did not give him an accountby revelation, at what times and by what steps it should go away. Theknowledge of the former was necessary to his preparing the ark; but theknowledge of the latter would serve only to gratify curiosity; andconcealing it from him would exercise his faith and patience. Noah sentforth a raven from the ark, which went flying about, and feeding on thecarcasses that floated. Noah then sent forth a dove, which returned thefirst time without good news; but the second time, she brought an oliveleaf in her bill, plucked off, plainly showing that trees, fruit trees,began to appear above water. Noah sent forth the dove the second time,seven days after the first, and the third time was after seven daysalso; probably on the sabbath day. Having kept the sabbath with hislittle church, he expected especial blessings from Heaven, and inquiredconcerning them. The dove is an emblem of a gracious soul, that,finding no solid peace of satisfaction in this deluged, defiling world,returns to Christ as to its ark, as to its Noah, its rest. The defilingworld, returns to Christ as to its ark, as to its Noah, its rest. Thecarnal heart, like the raven, takes up with the world, and feeds on thecarrion it finds there; but return thou to my rest, O my soul; to thyNoah, so the word is, Ps 116:7. And as Noah put forth his hand, andtook the dove, and pulled her to him, into the ark, so Christ willsave, and help, and welcome those that flee to him for rest. (Ge8:13-19)
Gen 8:13-19	<br>God consults our benefit, rather than our desires; he knows what isgood for us better than we do for ourselves, and how long it is fit ourrestraints should continue, and desired mercies should be delayed. Wewould go out of the ark before the ground is dried; and perhaps, if thedoor, is shut, are ready to thrust off the covering, and to climb upsome other way; but God's time of showing mercy is the best time. AsNoah had a command to go into the ark, so, how tedious soever hisconfinement there was, he would wait for a command to go out of itagain. We must in all our ways acknowledge God, and set him before usin all our removals. Those only go under God's protection, who followGod's direction, and submit to him.
Gen 8:20-22	<br>Noah was now gone out into a desolate world, where, one might havethought, his first care would have been to build a house for himself,but he begins with an alter for God. He begins well, that begins withGod. Though Noah's stock of cattle was small, and that saved at greatcare and pains, yet he did not grudge to serve God out of it. ServingGod with our little is the way to make it more; we must never thinkthat is wasted with which God is honoured. The first thing done in thenew world was an act of worship. We are now to express ourthankfulness, not by burnt-offerings, but by praise, and piousdevotions and conversation. God was well pleased with what was done.But the burning flesh could no more please God, than the blood of bullsand goats, except as typical of the sacrifice of Christ, and expressingNoah's humble faith and devotedness to God. The flood washed away therace of wicked men, but it did not remove sin from man's nature, whobeing conceived and born in sin, thinks, devises, and loves wickedness,even from his youth, and that as much since the flood as before. ButGod graciously declared he never would drown the world again. While theearth remains, and man upon it, there shall be summer and winter. It isplain that this earth is not to remain always. It, and all the works init, must shortly be burned up; and we look for new heavens and a newearth, when all these things shall be dissolved. But as long as it doesremain, God's providence will cause the course of times and seasons togo on, and makes each to know its place. And on this word we depend,that thus it shall be. We see God's promises to the creatures madegood, and may infer that his promises to all believers shall be so.
Gen 9:1-3	<br>The blessing of God is the cause of our doing well. On him we depend,to him we should be thankful. Let us not forget the advantage andpleasure we have from the labour of beasts, and which their fleshaffords. Nor ought we to be less thankful for the security we enjoyfrom the savage and hurtful beasts, through the fear of man which Godhas fixed deep in them. We see the fulfilment of this promise everyday, and on every side. This grant of the animals for food fullywarrants the use of them, but not the abuse of them by gluttony, stillless by cruelty. We ought not to pain them needlessly whilst they live,nor when we take away their lives.
Gen 9:4-7	<br>The main reason of forbidding the eating of blood, doubtless wasbecause the shedding of blood in sacrifices was to keep the worshippersin mind of the great atonement; yet it seems intended also to checkcruelty, lest men, being used to shed and feed upon the blood ofanimals, should grow unfeeling to them, and be less shocked at the ideaof shedding human blood. Man must not take away his own life. Our livesare God's, and we must only give them up when he pleases. If we in anyway hasten our own death, we are accountable to God for it. When Godrequires the life of a man from him that took it away unjustly, themurderer cannot render that, and therefore must render his own instead.One time or other, in this world or in the next, God will discovermurders, and punish those murders which are beyond man's power topunish. But there are those who are ministers of God to protect theinnocent, by being a terror to evil-doers, and they must not bear thesword in vain, Ro 13:4. Wilful murder ought always to be punished withdeath. To this law there is a reason added. Such remains of God's imageare still upon fallen man, that he who unjustly kills a man, defacesthe image of God, and does dishonour to him.
Gen 9:8-17	<br>As the old world was ruined, to be a monument of justice, so this worldremains to this day a monument of mercy. But sin, that drowned the oldworld, will burn this. Articles of agreement among men are sealed, thatwhat is promised may be the more solemn, and the doing of what iscovenanted the more sure to mutual satisfaction. The seal of thiscovenant was the rainbow, which, it is likely, was seen in the cloudsbefore, but was never a seal of the covenant till now it was made so.The rainbow appears when we have most reason to fear the rainprevailing; God then shows this seal of the promise, that it shall notprevail. The thicker the cloud, the brighter the bow in the cloud.Thus, as threatening afflictions abound, encouraging consolations muchmore abound. The rainbow is the reflection of the beams of the sunshining upon or through the drops of rain: all the glory of the sealsof the covenant are derived from Christ, the Sun of righteousness. Andhe will shed a glory on the tears of his saints. A bow speaks terror,but this has neither string nor arrow; and a bow alone will do littlehurt. It is a bow, but it is directed upward, not toward the earth; forthe seals of the covenant were intended to comfort, not to terrify. AsGod looks upon the bow, that he may remember the covenant, so shouldwe, that we may be mindful of the covenant with faith and thankfulness.Without revelation this gracious assurance could not be known; andwithout faith it can be of no use to us; and thus it is as to the stillgreater dangers to which all are exposed, and as to the new covenantwith its blessings.
Gen 9:18-23	<br>The drunkenness of Noah is recorded in the Bible, with that fairnesswhich is found only in the Scripture, as a case and proof of humanweakness and imperfection, even though he may have been surprised intothe sin; and to show that the best of men cannot stand upright, unlessthey depend upon Divine grace, and are upheld thereby. Ham appears tohave been a bad man, and probably rejoiced to find his father in anunbecoming situation. It was said of Noah, that he was perfect in hisgenerations, ch. 6:9; but this is meant of sincerity, not of a sinlessperfection. Noah, who had kept sober in drunken company, is now drunkin sober company. Let him that thinks he stands, take heed lest hefall. We have need to be very careful when we use God's good creaturesplentifully, lest we use them to excess, Lu 21:34. The consequence ofNoah's sin was shame. Observe here the great evil of the sin ofdrunkenness. It discovers men; what infirmities they have, they betraywhen they are drunk; and secrets are then easily got out of them.Drunken porters keep open gates. It disgraces men, and exposes them tocontempt. As it shows them, so it shames them. Men say and do that whendrunken, which, when sober, they would blush to think of. Notice thecare of Shem and Japheth to cover their father's shame. There is amantle of love to be thrown over the faults of all, 1Pe 4:8. Besidethat, there is a robe of reverence to be thrown over the faults ofparents and other superiors. The blessing of God attends on those whohonour their parents, and his curse lights especially on those whodishonour them.
Gen 9:24-29	<br>Noah declares a curse on Canaan, the son of Ham; perhaps this grandsonof his was more guilty than the rest. A servant of servants, that is,The meanest and most despicable servant, shall he be, even to hisbrethren. This certainly points at the victories in after-timesobtained by Israel over the Canaanites, by which they were put to thesword, or brought to pay tribute. The whole continent of Africa waspeopled mostly by the descendants of Ham; and for how many ages havethe better parts of that country lain under the dominion of the Romans,then of the Saracens, and now of the Turks! In what wickedness,ignorance, barbarity, slavery, and misery most of the inhabitants live!And of the poor negroes, how many every year are sold and bought, likebeasts in the market, and conveyed from one quarter of the world to dothe work of beasts in another! But this in no way excuses thecovetousness and barbarity of those who enrich themselves with theproduct of their sweat and blood. God has not commanded us to enslavenegroes; and, without doubt, he will severely punish all such cruelwrongs. The fulfilment of this prophecy, which contains almost ahistory of the world, frees Noah from the suspicion of having utteredit from personal anger. It fully proves that the Holy Spirit tookoccasion from Ham's offence to reveal his secret purposes. "Blessed bethe Lord God of Shem." The church should be built up and continued inthe posterity of Shem; of him came the Jews, who were, for a greatwhile, the only professing people God had in the world. Christ, who wasthe Lord God, in his human nature should descend from Shem; for of him,as concerning the flesh, Christ came. Noah also blesses Japheth, and,in him, the isles of the gentiles that were peopled by his seed. Itspeaks of the conversion of the gentiles, and the bringing of them intothe church. We may read it, "God shall persuade Japheth, and beingpersuaded, he shall dwell in the tents of Shem." Jews and gentilesshall be united together in the gospel fold; both shall be one inChrist. Noah lived to see two worlds; but being an heir of therighteousness which is by faith, he now rests in hope, waiting to see abetter than either.
Gen 10:1-7	<br>This chapter shows concerning the three sons of Noah, that of them wasthe whole earth overspread. No nation but that of the Jews can be surefrom which of these seventy it has come. The lists of names of fathersand sons were preserved of the Jews alone, for the sake of the Messiah.Many learned men, however, have, with some probability, shown which ofthe nations of the earth descended from each of the sons of Noah To theposterity of Japheth were allotted the isles of the gentiles; probably,the island of Britain among the rest. All places beyond the sea fromJudea are called isles, Jer 25:22. That promise, Isa 42:4, The islesshall wait for his law, speaks of the conversion of the gentiles to thefaith of Christ.
Gen 10:8-14	<br>Nimrod was a great man in his day; he began to be mighty in the earth,Those before him were content to be upon the same level with theirneighbours, and though every man bare rule in his own house, yet no manpretended any further. Nimrod was resolved to lord it over hisneighbours. The spirit of the giants before the flood, who becamemighty men, and men of renown, Ge 6:4, revived in him. Nimrod was agreat hunter. Hunting then was the method of preventing the hurtfulincrease of wild beasts. This required great courage and address, andthus gave an opportunity for Nimrod to command others, and graduallyattached a number of men to one leader. From such a beginning, it islikely, that Nimrod began to rule, and to force others to submit. Heinvaded his neighbours' rights and properties, and persecuted innocentmen; endeavouring to make all his own by force and violence. He carriedon his oppressions and violence in defiance of God himself. Nimrod wasa great ruler. Some way or other, by arts or arms, he got into power,and so founded a monarchy, which was the terror of the mighty, and bidfair to rule all the world. Nimrod was a great builder. Observe inNimrod the nature of ambition. It is boundless; much would have more,and still cries, Give, give. It is restless; Nimrod, when he had fourcities under his command, could not be content till he had four more.It is expensive; Nimrod will rather be at the charge of rearing cities,than not have the honour of ruling them. It is daring, and will stickat nothing. Nimrod's name signifies rebellion; tyrants to men arerebels to God. The days are coming, when conquerors will no longer bespoken of with praise, as in man's partial histories, but be brandedwith infamy, as in the impartial records of the Bible.
Gen 10:15-32	<br>The posterity of Canaan were numerous, rich, and pleasantly seated; yetCanaan was under a Divine curse, and not a curse causeless. Those thatare under the curse of God, may, perhaps, thrive and prosper in thisworld; for we cannot know love or hatred, the blessing or the curse, bywhat is before us, but by what is within us. The curse of God alwaysworks really, and always terribly. Perhaps it is a secret curse, acurse to the soul, and does not work so that others can see it; or aslow curse, and does not work soon; but sinners are reserved by it fora day of wrath Canaan here has a better land than either Shem orJapheth, and yet they have a better lot, for they inherit the blessing.Abram and his seed, God's covenant people, descended from Eber, andfrom him were called Hebrews. How much better it is to be like Eber,the father of a family of saints and honest men, than the father of afamily of hunters after power, worldly wealth, or vanities. Goodness istrue greatness.
Gen 11:1-4	<br>How soon men forget the most tremendous judgments, and go back to theirformer crimes! Though the desolations of the deluge were before theireyes, though they sprang from the stock of righteous Noah, yet evenduring his life-time, wickedness increases exceedingly. Nothing but thesanctifying grace of the Holy Spirit can remove the sinful lusts of thehuman will, and the depravity of the human heart. God's purpose was,that mankind should form many nations, and people all lands. Incontempt of the Divine will, and against the counsel of Noah, the bulkof mankind united to build a city and a tower to prevent theirseparating. Idolatry was begun, and Babel became one of its chiefseats. They made one another more daring and resolute. Let us learn toprovoke one another to love and to good works, as sinners stir up andencourage one another to wicked works.
Gen 11:5-9	<br>Here is an expression after the manner of men; The Lord came down tosee the city. God is just and fair in all he does against sin andsinners, and condemns none unheard. Pious Eber is not found among thisungodly crew; for he and his are called the children of God; theirsouls joined not themselves to the assembly of these children of men.God suffered them to go on some way, that the works of their hands,from which they promised themselves lasting honour, might turn to theirlasting reproach. God has wise and holy ends, in allowing the enemiesof his glory to carry on their wicked projects a great way, and toprosper long. Observe the wisdom and mercy of God, in the methods takenfor defeating this undertaking. And the mercy of God in not making thepenalty equal to the offence; for he deals not with us according to oursins. The wisdom of God, in fixing upon a sure way to stop theseproceedings. If they could not understand one another, they could nothelp one another; this would take them off from their building. God hasvarious means, and effectual ones, to baffle and defeat the projects ofproud men that set themselves against him, and particularly he dividesthem among themselves. Notwithstanding their union and obstinacy Godwas above them; for who ever hardened his heart against him, andprospered? Their language was confounded. We all suffer by it to thisday: in all the pains and trouble used to learn the languages we haveoccasion for, we suffer for the rebellion of our ancestors at Babel.Nay, and those unhappy disputes, which are strifes of words, and arisefrom misunderstanding one another's words, for aught we know, are owingto this confusion of tongues. They left off to build the city. Theconfusion of their tongues not only unfitted them for helping oneanother, but they saw the hand of the Lord gone out against them. It iswisdom to leave off that which we see God fights against. God is ableto blast and bring to nought all the devices and designs ofBabel-builders: there is no wisdom nor counsel against the Lord. Thebuilders departed according to their families, and the tongue theyspake, to the countries and places allotted to them. The children ofmen never did, nor ever will, come all together again, till the greatday, when the Son of man shall sit upon the throne of his glory, andall nations shall be gathered before him.
Gen 11:10-26	<br>Here is a genealogy, or list of names, ending in Abram, the friend ofGod, and thus leading towards Christ, the promised Seed, who was theson of Abram. Nothing is left upon record but their names and ages; theHoly Ghost seeming to hasten through them to the history of Abram. Howlittle do we know of those that are gone before us in this world, evenof those that lived in the same places where we live, as we likewiseknow little of those who now live in distant places! We have enough todo to mind our own work. When the earth began to be peopled, men'slives began to shorten; this was the wise disposal of Providence.
Gen 11:27-32	<br>Here begins the story of Abram, whose name is famous in bothTestaments. Even the children of Eber had become worshippers of falsegods. Those who are through grace, heirs of the land of promise, oughtto remember what was the land of their birth; what was their corruptand sinful state by nature. Abram's brethren were, Nahor, out of whosefamily both Isaac and Jacob had their wives; and Haran, the father ofLot, who died before his father. Children cannot be sure that theyshall outlive their parents. Haran died in Ur, before the happy removalof the family out of that idolatrous country. It concerns us to hastenout of our natural state, lest death surprise us in it. We here read ofAbram's departure out of Ur of the Chaldees, with his father Terah, hisnephew Lot, and the rest of his family, in obedience to the call ofGod. This chapter leaves them about mid-way between Ur and Canaan,where they dwelt till Terah's death. Many reach to Charran, and yetfall short of Canaan; they are not far from the kingdom of God, and yetnever come thither.
Gen 12:1-3	<br>God made choice of Abram, and singled him out from among hisfellow-idolaters, that he might reserve a people for himself, amongwhom his true worship might be maintained till the coming of Christ.From henceforward Abram and his seed are almost the only subject of thehistory in the Bible. Abram was tried whether he loved God better thanall, and whether he could willingly leave all to go with God. Hiskindred and his father's house were a constant temptation to him, hecould not continue among them without danger of being infected by them.Those who leave their sins, and turn to God, will be unspeakablegainers by the change. The command God gave to Abram, is much the samewith the gospel call, for natural affection must give way to Divinegrace. Sin, and all the occasions of it, must be forsaken; particularlybad company. Here are many great and precious promises. All God'sprecepts are attended with promises to the obedient. 1. I will make ofthee a great nation. When God took Abram from his own people, hepromised to make him the head of another people. 2. I will bless thee.Obedient believers shall be sure to inherit the blessing. 3. I willmake thy name great. The name of obedient believers shall certainly bemade great. 4. Thou shalt be a blessing. Good men are the blessings oftheir country. 5. I will bless them that bless thee, and curse him thatcurseth thee. God will take care that none are losers, by any servicedone for his people. 6. In thee shall all the families of the earth beblessed. Jesus Christ is the great blessing of the world, the greatestthat ever the world possessed. All the true blessedness the world isnow, or ever shall be possessed of, is owing to Abram and hisposterity. Through them we have a Bible, a Saviour, and a gospel. Theyare the stock on which the Christian church is grafted.
Gen 12:4,5	<br>Abram believed that the blessing of the Almighty would make up for allhe could lose or leave behind, supply all his wants, and answer andexceed all his desires; and he knew that nothing but misery wouldfollow disobedience. Such believers, being justified by faith inChrist, have peace with God. They hold on their way to Canaan. They arenot discouraged by the difficulties in their way, nor drawn aside bythe delights they meet with. Those who set out for heaven mustpersevere to the end. What we undertake, in obedience to God's command,and in humble attendance on his providence, will certainly succeed, andend with comfort at last. Canaan was not, as other lands, a mereoutward possession, but a type of heaven, and in this respect thepatriarchs so earnestly prized it.
Gen 12:6-9	<br>Abram found the country peopled by Canaanites, who were bad neighbours.He journeyed, going on still. Sometimes it is the lot of good men to beunsettled, and often to remove into various states. Believers must lookon themselves as strangers and sojourners in this world, Heb 11:8,13,14. But observe how much comfort Abram had in God. When he could havelittle satisfaction in converse with the Canaanites whom he foundthere, he had abundance of pleasure in communion with that God, whobrought him thither, and did not leave him. Communion with God is keptup by the word and by prayer. God reveals himself and his favours tohis people by degrees; before, he had promised to show Abram this land,now, to give it to him: as grace is growing, so is comfort. It shouldseem, Abram understood it also as a grant of a better land, of whichthis was a type; for he looked for a heavenly country, Heb 11:16. Assoon as Abram was got to Canaan, though he was but a stranger andsojourner there, yet he set up, and kept up, the worship of God in hisfamily. He not only minded the ceremonial part of religion, theoffering of sacrifice; but he made conscience of seeking his God, andcalling on his name; that spiritual sacrifice with which God is wellpleased. He preached concerning the name of the Lord; he taught hisfamily and neighbours the knowledge of the true God, and his holyreligion. The way of family worship is a good old way, no new thing,but the ancient usage of the saints. Abram was rich, and had a numerousfamily, was now unsettled, and in the midst of enemies; yet, whereverhe pitched his tent, he built an altar: wherever we go, let us not failto take our religion along with us.
Gen 12:10-20	<br>There is no state on earth free from trials, nor any character freefrom blemishes. There was famine in Canaan, the glory of all lands, andunbelief, with the evils it ever brings, in Abram the father of thefaithful. Perfect happiness and perfect purity dwell only in heaven.Abram, when he must for a time quit Canaan, goes to Egypt, that hemight not seem to look back, and meaning to tarry there no longer thanneedful. There Abram dissembled his relation to Sarai, equivocated, andtaught his wife and his attendants to do so too. He concealed a truth,so as in effect to deny it, and exposed thereby both his wife and theEgyptians to sin. The grace Abram was most noted for, was faith; yet hethus fell through unbelief and distrust of the Divine providence, evenafter God had appeared to him twice. Alas, what will become of weakfaith, when strong faith is thus shaken! If God did not deliver us,many a time, out of straits and distresses which we bring ourselvesinto, by our own sin and folly, we should be ruined. He deals not withus according to our deserts. Those are happy chastisements that hinderus in a sinful way, and bring us to our duty, particularly to the dutyof restoring what we have wrongfully taken or kept. Pharaoh's reproofof Abram was very just: What is this that thou hast done? Howunbecoming a wise and good man! If those who profess religion, do thatwhich is unfair and deceptive, especially if they say that whichborders upon a lie, they must expect to hear of it; and they havereason to thank those who will tell them of it. The sending away waskind. Pharaoh was so far from any design to kill Abram, as he feared,that he took particular care of him. We often perplex ourselves withfears which are altogether groundless. Many a time we fear where nofear is. Pharaoh charged his men not to hurt Abram in any thing. It isnot enough for those in authority, that they do not hurt themselves;they must keep their servants and those about them from doing hurt.
Gen 13:1-4	<br>Abram was very rich: he was very heavy, so the Hebrew word is; forriches are a burden; and they that will be rich, do but load themselveswith thick clay, Hab 2:6. There is a burden of care in getting riches,fear in keeping them, temptation in using them, guilt in abusing them,sorrow in losing them, and a burden of account at last to be given upabout them. Yet God in his providence sometimes makes good men richmen, and thus God's blessing made Abram rich without sorrow, Pr 10:22.Though it is hard for a rich man to get to heaven, yet in some cases itmay be, Mr 10:23,24. Nay, outward prosperity, if well managed, is anornament to piety, and an opportunity for doing more good. Abramremoved to Bethel. His altar was gone, so that he could not offersacrifice; but he called on the name of the Lord. You may as soon finda living man without breath as one of God's people without prayer.
Gen 13:5-9	<br>Riches not only afford matter for strife, and are the things mostcommonly striven about; but they also stir up a spirit of contention,by making people proud and covetous. Mine and thine are the greatmake-bates of the world. Poverty and labour, wants and wanderings,could not separate Abram and Lot; but riches did so. Bad servants oftenmake a great deal of mischief in families and among neighbours, bytheir pride and passion, lying, slandering, and talebearing. What madethe quarrel worse was, that the Canaanite and the Perizzite dwelt thenin the land. The quarrels of professors are the reproach of religion,and give occasion to the enemies of the Lord to blaspheme. It is bestto keep the peace, that it be not broken; but the next best is, ifdifferences do happen, with all speed to quench the fire that is brokenout. The attempt to stay this strife was made by Abram, although he wasthe elder and the greater man. Abram shows himself to be a man of coolspirit, that had the command of his passion, and knew how to turn awaywrath by a soft answer. Those that would keep the peace, must neverrender railing for railing. And of a condescending spirit; he waswilling to beseech even his inferior to be at peace. Whatever othersare for, the people of God must be for peace. Abram's plea for peacewas very powerful. Let the people of the land contend about trifles;but let not us fall out, who know better things, and look for a bettercountry. Professors of religion should be most careful to avoidcontention. Many profess to be for peace who will do nothing towardsit: not so Abram. When God condescends to beseech us to be reconciled,we may well beseech one another. Though God had promised Abram to givethis land to his seed, yet he offered an equal or better share to Lot,who had not an equal right; and he will not, under the protection ofGod's promise, act hardly to his kinsman. It is noble to be willing toyield for peace' sake.
Gen 13:10-13	<br>Abram having offered Lot the choice, he at once accepted it. Passionand selfishness make men rude. Lot looked to the goodness of the land;therefore he doubted not that in such a fruitful soil he shouldcertainly thrive. But what came of it? Those who, in choosingrelations, callings, dwellings, or settlements, are guided and governedby the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eye, or the pride of life,cannot expect God's presence or blessing. They are commonlydisappointed even in that which they principally aim at. In all ourchoices this principle should rule, That is best for us, which is bestfor our souls. Lot little considered the badness of the inhabitants.The men of Sodom were impudent, daring sinners. This was the iniquityof Sodom, pride, fulness of bread, and abundance of idleness, Eze16:49. God often gives great plenty to great sinners. It has often beenthe vexatious lot of good men to live among wicked neighbours; and itmust be the more grievous, if, as Lot here, they have brought it uponthemselves by a wrong choice.
Gen 13:14-18	<br>Those are best prepared for the visits of Divine grace, whose spiritsare calm, and not ruffled with passion. God will abundantly make up inspiritual peace, what we lose for preserving neighbourly peace. Whenour relations are separated from us, yet God is not. Observe also thepromises with which God now comforted and enriched Abram. Of two thingshe assures him; a good land, and a numerous issue to enjoy it. Theprospects seen by faith are more rich and beautiful than those we seearound us. God bade him walk through the land, not to think of fixingin it, but expect to be always unsettled, and walking through it to abetter Canaan. He built an altar, in token of his thankfulness to God.When God meets us with gracious promises, he expects that we shouldattend him with humble praises. In outward difficulties, it is veryprofitable for the true believer to mediate on the glorious inheritancewhich the Lord has for him at the last.
Gen 14:1-12	<br>The wars of nations make great figure in history, but we should nothave had the record of this war if Abram and Lot had not beenconcerned. Out of covetousness, Lot had settled in fruitful, but wickedSodom. Its inhabitants were the most ripe for vengeance of all thedescendants of Canaan. The invaders were from Chaldea and Persia, thenonly small kingdoms. They took Lot among the rest, and his goods.Though he was righteous, and Abram's brother's son, yet he was with therest in this trouble. Neither our own piety, nor our relation to thefavourites of Heaven, will be our security when God's judgments areabroad. Many an honest man fares the worse for his wicked neighbours:it is our wisdom to separate, or at least to distinguish ourselves fromthem, 2Co 6:17. So near a relation of Abram should have been acompanion and a disciple of Abram. If he chose to dwell in Sodom, hemust thank himself if he share in Sodom's losses. When we go out of theway of our duty, we put ourselves from under God's protection, andcannot expect that the choice made by our lusts, should end to ourcomfort. They took Lot's goods; it is just with God to deprive us ofenjoyments, by which we suffer ourselves to be deprived of theenjoyment of him.
Gen 14:13-16	<br>Abram takes this opportunity to give a real proof of his being trulyfriendly to Lot. We ought to be ready to succour those in distress,especially relations and friends. And though others may have beenwanting in their duty to us, yet we must not neglect our duty to them.Abram rescued the captives. As we have opportunity, we must do good toall.
Gen 14:17-20	<br>Melchizedek is spoken of as a king of Salem, supposed to be the placeafterwards called Jerusalem, and it is generally thought that he wasonly a man. The words of the apostle, Heb 7:3, state only, that thesacred history has said nothing of his ancestors. The silence of theScriptures on this, is to raise our thoughts to Him, whose generationcannot be declared. Bread and wine were suitable refreshment for theweary followers of Abram; and it is remarkable that Christ appointedthe same as the memorials of his body and blood, which are meat anddrink indeed to the soul. Melchizedek blessed Abram from God. Heblessed God from Abram. We ought to give thanks for other's mercies asfor our own. Jesus Christ, our great High Priest, is the Mediator bothof our prayers and praises, and not only offers up ours, but his ownfor us. Abram gave him the tenth of the spoils, Heb 7:4. When we havereceived some great mercy from God, it is very fit we should expressour thankfulness by some special act of pious charity. Jesus Christ,our great Melchisedek, is to have homage done him, and to be humblyacknowledged as our King and Priest; not only the tithe of all, but allwe have, must be given up to him.
Gen 14:21-24	<br>Observe the king of Sodom's grateful offer to Abram, Give me the souls,and take thou the substance. Gratitude teaches us to recompense to theutmost of our power, those that have undergone fatigues, run hazards,and been at expense for our service and benefit. Abram generouslyrefused this offer. He accompanies his refusal with a good reason, Lestthou shouldest say, I have made Abram rich: which would reflect uponthe promise promise and covenant of God, as if He would not haveenriched Abraham without the spoils of Sodom. The people of God must,for their credit's sake, take heed of doing any thing that looks meanor mercenary, or that savors of covetousness and self-seeking. Abrahamcan trust the Possessor of Heaven and earth to provide for him.
Gen 15:2-6	<br>Though we must never complain of God, yet we have leave to complain tohim; and to state all our grievances. It is ease to a burdened spirit,to open its case to a faithful and compassionate friend. Abram'scomplaint is, that he had no child; that he was never likely to haveany; that the want of a son was so great a trouble to him, that it tookaway all his comfort. If we suppose that Abram looked no further thanoutward comfort, this complaint was to be blamed. But if we supposethat Abram herein had reference to the promised Seed, his desire wasvery commendable. Till we have evidence of our interest in Christ, weshould not rest satisfied; what will all avail me, if I go Christless?If we continue instant in prayer, yet pray with humble submission tothe Divine will, we shall not seek in vain. God gave Abram an expresspromise of a son. Christians may believe in God with respect to thecommon concerns of this life; but the faith by which they arejustified, always has respect to the person and work of Christ. Abrambelieved in God as promising Christ; they believe in him as havingraised him from the dead, Ro 4:24. Through faith in his blood theyobtain forgiveness of sins.
Gen 15:7-11	<br>Assurance was given to Abram of the land of Canaan for an inheritance.God never promises more than he is able to perform, as men often do.Abram did as God commanded him. He divided the beasts in the midst,according to the ceremony used in confirming covenants, Jer 34:18,19.Having prepared according to God's appointment, he set himself to waitfor the sign God might give him. A watch must be kept upon ourspiritual sacrifices. When vain thoughts, like these fowls, come downupon our sacrifices, we must drive them away, and seek to attend on Godwithout distraction.
Gen 15:12-16	<br>A deep sleep fell upon Abram; with this sleep a horror of greatdarkness fell upon him: a sudden change. The children of light do notalways walk in the light. Several things were then foretold. 1. Thesuffering state of Abram's seed for a long time. They shall bestrangers. The heirs of heaven are strangers on earth. They shall beservants; but Canaanites serve under a curse, the Hebrews under ablessing. They shall be suffers. Those that are blessed and beloved ofGod, are often sorely afflicted by wicked men. 2. The judgment of theenemies of Abram's seed. Though God may allow persecutors andoppressors to trample upon his people a great while, he will certainlyreckon with them at last. 3. That great event, the deliverance ofAbram's seed out of Egypt, is here foretold. 4. Their happy settlementin Canaan. They shall come hither again. The measure of sin fillsgradually. Some people's measure of sin fills slowly. The knowledge offuture events would seldom add to our comfort. In the most favouredfamilies, and most happy lives, there are so many afflictions, that itis merciful in God to conceal what will befall us and ours.
Gen 15:17-21	<br>The smoking furnace and the burning lamp, probably represented theIsraelites' severe trials and joyful deliverance, with their gracioussupports in the mean time. It is probable that this furnace and lamp,which passed between the pieces, burned and consumed them, and socompleted the sacrifice, and testified God's acceptance of it. So itintimates that God's covenants with man are made by sacrifice, Ps 50:5.And we may know that he accepts our sacrifices, if he kindles in oursouls pious and devout affections. The bounds of the land granted arestated. Several nations, or tribes, are spoken of, that must be castout to make room for the seed of Abram. In this chapter we perceive inAbram faith struggling against, and triumphing over, unbelief. Wondernot, believers, if you meet with seasons of darkness and distress. Butit is not the will of God that you should be cast down: fear not; forall that he was to Abram he will be to you.
Gen 16:1-3	<br>Sarai, no longer expecting to have children herself, proposed to Abramto take another wife, whose children she might; her slave, whosechildren would be her property. This was done without asking counsel ofthe Lord. Unbelief worked, God's almighty power was forgotten. It was abad example, and a source of manifold uneasiness. In every relation andsituation in life there is some cross for us to bear: much of theexercise of faith consists in patiently submitting, in waiting theLord's time, and using only those means which he appoints for theremoval of the cross. Foul temptations may have very fair pretences,and be coloured with that which is very plausible. Fleshly wisdom putsus out of God's way. This would not be the case, if we would askcounsel of God by his word and by prayer, before we attempt that whichis doubtful.
Gen 16:4-6	<br>Abram's unhappy marriage to Hagar very soon made a great deal ofmischief. We may thank ourselves for the guilt and grief that followus, when we go out of the way of our duty. See it in this case,Passionate people often quarrel with others, for things of which theythemselves must bear the blame. Sarai had given her maid to Abram, yetshe cries out, My wrong be upon thee. That is never said wisely, whichpride and anger put into our mouths. Those are not always in the right,who are most loud and forward in appealing to God: such rash and boldimprecations commonly speak guilt and a bad cause. Hagar forgot thatshe herself had first given the provocation, by despising her mistress.Those that suffer for their faults, ought to bear it patiently, 1Pe2:20.
Gen 16:7-16	<br>Hagar was out of her place, and out of the way of her duty, and goingfurther astray, when the Angel found her. It is a great mercy to bestopped in a sinful way, either by conscience or by providence. Whencecomest thou? Consider that thou art running from duty, and theprivileges thou wast blest with in Abram's tent. It is good to live ina religious family, which those ought to consider who have thisadvantage. Whither wilt thou go? Thou art running into sin; if Hagarreturn to Egypt, she will return to idol gods, and into danger in thewilderness through which she must travel. Recollecting who we are,would often teach us our duty. Inquiring whence we came, would show usour sin and folly. Considering whither we shall go, discovers ourdanger and misery. And those who leave their space and duty, musthasten their return, how mortifying soever it be. The declaration ofthe Angel, "I will," shows this Angel was the eternal Word and Son ofGod. Hagar could not but admire the Lord's mercy, and feel, Have I, whoam so unworthy, been favoured with a gracious visit from the Lord? Shewas brought to a better temper, returned, and by her behaviour softenedSarai, and received more gentle treatment. Would that we were alwayssuitably impressed with this thought, Thou God seest me!
Gen 17:1-6	<br>The covenant was to be accomplished in due time. The promised Seed wasChrist, and Christians in him. And all who are of faith are blessedwith faithful Abram, being partakers of the same covenant blessings. Intoken of this covenant his name was changed from Abram, "a highfather," to Abraham, "the father of a multitude." All that theChristian world enjoys, it is indebted for to Abraham and his Seed.
Gen 17:7-14	<br>The covenant of grace is from everlasting in the counsels of it, and toeverlasting in the consequences of it. The token of the covenant wascircumcision. It is here said to be the covenant which Abraham and hisseed must keep. Those who will have the Lord to be to them a God, mustresolve to be to him a people. Not only Abraham and Isaac, and hisposterity by Isaac, were to be circumcised, but also Ishmael and thebond-servants. It sealed not only the covenant of the land of Canaan toIsaac's posterity, but of heaven, through Christ, to the whole churchof God. The outward sign is for the visible church; the inward seal ofthe Spirit is peculiar to those whom God knows to be believers, and healone can know them. The religious observance of this institution wasrequired, under a very severe penalty. It is dangerous to make light ofDivine institutions, and to live in the neglect of them. The covenantin question was one that involved great blessings for the world in allfuture ages. Even the blessedness of Abraham himself, and all therewards conferred upon him, were for Christ's sake. Abraham wasjustified, as we have seen, not by his own righteousness, but by faithin the promised Messiah.
Gen 17:15-22	<br>Here is the promise made to Abraham of a son by Sarai, in whom thepromise made to him should be fulfilled. The assurance of this promisewas the change of Sarai's name into Sarah. Sarai signifies my princess,as if her honour were confined to one family only; Sarah signifies aprincess. The more favours God confers upon us, the more low we shouldbe in our own eyes. Abraham showed great joy; he laughed, it was alaughter of delight, not of distrust. Now it was that Abraham rejoicedto see Christ's day; now he saw it and was glad, Joh 8:56. Abraham,dreading lest Ishmael should be abandoned and forsaken of God, put up apetition on his behalf. God gives us leave in prayer to be particularin making known our requests. Whatever is our care and fear, should bespread before God in prayer. It is the duty of parents to pray fortheir children, and the great thing we should desire is, that they maybe kept in covenant with Him, and may have grace to walk before him inuprightness. Common blessings are secured to Ishmael. Outward goodthings are often given to those children of godly parents who are bornafter the flesh, for their parents' sake. Covenant blessings arereserved for Isaac, and appropriated to him.
Gen 17:23-27	<br>Abraham and all his family were circumcised; so receiving the token ofthe covenant, and distinguishing themselves from other families thathad no part nor lot in the matter. It was an implicit obedience; he didas God said unto him, and did not ask why or wherefore. He did itbecause God bade him. It was a speedy obedience; in the self-same day.Sincere obedience makes no delay. Not only the doctrines of revelation,but the seals of God's covenant, remind us that we are guilty, pollutedsinners. They show us our need of the blood of atonement; they point tothe promised Saviour, and teach us to exercise faith in him. They showus that without regeneration, and sanctification by his Spirit, and themortification of our corrupt and carnal inclinations, we cannot be incovenant with God. But let us remember that the true circumcision isthat of the heart, by the Spirit, Ro 2:28,29. Both under the old andnew dispensation, many have had the outward profession, and the outwardseal, who were never sealed by the Holy Spirit of promise.
Gen 18:1-8	<br>Abraham was waiting to entertain any weary traveller, for inns were notto be met with as among us. While Abraham was thus sitting, he sawthree men coming. These were three heavenly beings in human bodies.Some think they were all created angels; others, that one of them wasthe Son of God, the Angel of the covenant. Washing the feet iscustomary in those hot climates, where only sandals are worn. We shouldnot be forgetful to entertain strangers, for thereby some haveentertained angels unawares, Heb 13:2; nay, the Lord of angels himself;as we always do, when for his sake we entertain the least of hisbrethren. Cheerful and obliging manners in showing kindness, are greatornaments to piety. Though our condescending Lord vouchsafes notpersonal visits to us, yet still by his Spirit he stands at the doorand knocks; when we are inclined to open, he deigns to enter; and byhis gracious consolations he provides a rich feast, of which we partakewith him, Re 3:20.
Gen 18:9-15	<br>Where is Sarah thy wife? was asked. Note the answer, In the tent. Justat hand, in her proper place, occupied in her household concerns. Thereis nothing got by gadding. Those are most likely to receive comfortfrom God and his promises, who are in their proper place, and in theway of their duty, Lu 2:8. We are slow of heart to believe, and needline upon line to the same purport. The blessings others have fromcommon providence, believers have from the Divine promise, which makesthem very sweet, and very sure. The spiritual seed of Abraham owe theirlife, and joy, and hope, and all, to the promise. Sarah thinks this toogood news to be true; she laughed, and therefore cannot as yet find inher heart to believe it. Sarah laughed. We might not have thought therewas a difference between Sarah's laughter and Abraham's, ch. 17:17; butHe who searches the heart, saw that the one sprung from unbelief, andthe other from faith. She denied that she had laughed. One sin commonlybrings in another, and it is not likely we shall strictly keep totruth, when we question the Divine truth. But whom the Lord loves hewill rebuke, convict, silence, and bring to repentance, and if they sinbefore him.
Gen 18:16-22	<br>The two who are supposed to have been created angels went toward Sodom.The one who is called Jehovah throughout the chapter, continued withAbraham, and would not hide from him the thing he intended to do.Though God long forbears with sinners, from which they fancy that theLord does not see, and does not regard; yet when the day of his wrathcomes, he will look toward them. The Lord will give Abraham anopportunity to intercede with him, and shows him the reason of hisconduct. Consider, as a very bright part of Abraham's character andexample, that he not only prayed with his family, but he was verycareful to teach and rule them well. Those who expect family blessingsmust make conscience of family duty. Abraham did not fill their headswith matters of doubtful dispute; but he taught them to be serious anddevout in the worship of God, and to be honest in their dealings withall men. Of how few may such a character be given in our days! Howlittle care is taken by masters of families to ground those under themin the principles of religion! Do we watch from sabbath to sabbathwhether they go forward or backward?
Gen 18:23-33	<br>Here is the first solemn prayer upon record in the Bible; and it is aprayer for the sparing of Sodom. Abraham prayed earnestly that Sodommight be spared, if but a few righteous persons should be found in it.Come and learn from Abraham what compassion we should feel for sinners,and how earnestly we should pray for them. We see here that theeffectual, fervent prayer of a righteous man avails much. Abraham,indeed, failed in his request for the whole place, but Lot wasmiraculously delivered. Be encouraged then to expect, by earnestprayer, the blessing of God upon your families, your friends, yourneighbourhood. To this end you must not only pray, but you must livelike Abraham. He knew the Judge of all the earth would do right. Hedoes not plead that the wicked may be spared for their own sake, orbecause it would be severe to destroy them, but for the sake of therighteous who might be found among them. And righteousness only can bemade a plea before God. How then did Christ make intercession fortransgressors? Not by blaming the Divine law, nor by alleging aught inextenuation or excuse of human guilt; but by pleading HIS OWN obedienceunto death.
Gen 19:1-29	<br>Lot was good, but there was not one more of the same character in thecity. All the people of Sodom were very wicked and vile. Care wastherefore taken for saving Lot and his family. Lot lingered; hetrifled. Thus many who are under convictions about their spiritualstate, and the necessity of a change, defer that needful work. Thesalvation of the most righteous men is of God's mercy, not by their ownmerit. We are saved by grace. God's power also must be acknowledged inbringing souls out of a sinful state If God had not been merciful tous, our lingering had been our ruin. Lot must flee for his life. Hemust not hanker after Sodom. Such commands as these are given to thosewho, through grace, are delivered out of a sinful state and condition.Return not to sin and Satan. Rest not in self and the world. Reachtoward Christ and heaven, for that is escaping to the mountain, shortof which we must not stop. Concerning this destruction, observe that itis a revelation of the wrath of God against sin and sinners of allages. Let us learn from hence the evil of sin, and its hurtful nature;it leads to ruin.
Gen 19:30-38	<br>See the peril of security. Lot, who kept chaste in Sodom, and was amourner for the wickedness of the place, and a witness against it, whenin the mountain, alone, and, as he thought, out of the way oftemptation, is shamefully overtaken. Let him that thinks he standshigh, and stands firm, take heed lest he fall. See the peril ofdrunkenness; it is not only a great sin itself, but lets in many sins,which bring a lasting wound and dishonour. Many a man does that, whenhe is drunk, which, when he is sober, he could not think of withouthorror. See also the peril of temptation, even from relations andfriends, whom we love and esteem, and expect kindness from. We mustdread a snare, wherever we are, and be always upon our guard. No excusecan be made for the daughters, nor for Lot. Scarcely any account can begiven of the affair but this, The heart is deceitful above all things,and desperately wicked: who can know it? From the silence of theScripture concerning Lot henceforward, learn that drunkenness, as itmakes men forgetful, so it makes them to be forgotten.
Gen 20:1-8	<br>Crooked policy will not prosper: it brings ourselves and others intodanger. God gives Abimelech notice of his danger of sin, and his dangerof death for his sin. Every wilful sinner is a dead man, but Abimelechpleads ignorance. If our consciences witness, that, however we may havebeen cheated into a snare, we have not knowingly sinned against God, itwill be our rejoicing in the day of evil. It is matter of comfort tothose who are honest, that God knows their honesty, and willacknowledge it. It is a great mercy to be hindered from committing sin;of this God must have the glory. But if we have ignorantly done wrong,that will not excuse us, if we knowingly persist in it. He that doeswrong, whoever he is, prince or peasant, shall certainly receive forthe wrong which he has done, unless he repent, and, if possible, makerestitution.
Gen 20:9-13	<br>See here much to blame, even in the father of the faithful. Mark hisdistrust of God, his undue care about life, his intent to deceive. Healso threw temptation in the way of others, caused affliction to them,exposed himself and Sarah to just rebukes, and yet attempted an excuse.These things are written for our warning, not for us to imitate. EvenAbraham hath not whereof to glory. He cannot be justified by his works,but must be indebted for justification, to that righteousness which isupon all and unto all them that believe. We must not condemn all ashypocrites who fall into sin, if they do not continue in it. But letthe unhumbled and impenitent take heed that they do not sin on,thinking that grace may abound. Abimelech, being warned of God, takesthe warning; and being truly afraid of sin and its consequences, herose early to pursue the directions given him.
Gen 20:14-18	<br>We often trouble ourselves, and even are led into temptation and sin,by groundless suspicions; and find the fear of God where we expected itnot. Agreements to deceive generally end in shame and sorrow; andrestraints from sin, though by suffering, should be thankfullyacknowledged. Though the Lord rebuke, yet he will pardon and deliverhis people, and he will give them favour in the sight of those withwhom they sojourn; and overrule their infirmities, when they arehumbled for them, so that they shall prove useful to themselves andothers.
Gen 21:1-8	<br>Few under the Old Testament were brought into the world with suchexpectations as Isaac. He was in this a type of Christ, that Seed whichthe holy God so long promised, and holy men so long expected. He wasborn according to the promise, at the set time of which God had spoken.God's promised mercies will certainly come at the time which He sets,and that is the best time. Isaac means "laughter," and there was goodreason for the name, ch. 17:17; 18:13. When the Sun of comfort is risenupon the soul, it is good to remember how welcome the dawning of theday was. When Sarah received the promise, she laughed with distrust anddoubt. When God gives us the mercies we began to despair of, we oughtto remember with sorrow and shame our sinful distrust of his power andpromise, when we were in pursuit of them. This mercy filled Sarah withjoy and wonder. God's favours to his covenant people are such assurpass their own and others' thoughts and expectations: who couldimagine that he should do so much for those that deserve so little,nay, for those that deserve so ill? Who would have said that God shouldsend his Son to die for us, his Spirit to make us holy, his angels toattend us? Who would have said that such great sins should be pardoned,such mean services accepted, and such worthless worms taken intocovenant? A short account of Isaac's infancy is given. God's blessingupon the nursing of children, and the preservation of them through theperils of the infant age, are to be acknowledged as signal instances ofthe care and tenderness of the Divine providence. See Ps 22:9,10; Ho11:1,2.
Gen 21:9-13	<br>Let us not overlook the manner in which this family matter instructs usnot to rest in outward privileges, or in our own doings. And let usseek the blessings of the new covenant by faith in its Divine Surety.Ishmael's conduct was persecution, being done in profane contempt ofthe covenant and promise, and with malice against Isaac. God takesnotice of what children say and do in their play; and will reckon withthem, if they say or do amiss, though their parents do not. Mocking isa great sin, and very provoking to God. And the children of promisemust expect to be mocked. Abraham was grieved that Ishmael shouldmisbehave, and Sarah demand so severe a punishment. But God showed himthat Isaac must be the father of the promised Seed; therefore, sendIshmael away, lest he corrupt the manners, or try to take the rights ofIsaac. The covenant seed of Abraham must be a people by themselves, notmingled with those who were out of covenant: Sarah little thought ofthis; but God turned aright what she said.
Gen 21:14-21	<br>If Hagar and Ishmael had behaved well in Abraham's family, they mighthave continued there; but they were justly punished. By abusingprivileges, we forfeit them. Those who know not when they are well off,will be made to know the worth of mercies by the want of them. Theywere brought to distress in the wilderness. It is not said that theprovisions were spent, or that Abraham sent them away without money.But the water was spent; and having lost their way, in that hot climateIshmael was soon overcome with fatigue and thirst. God's readiness tohelp us when we are in trouble, must not slacken, but quicken ourendeavours to help ourselves. The promise concerning her son isrepeated, as a reason why Hagar should bestir herself to help him. Itshould engage our care and pains about children and young people, toconsider that we know not what great use God has designed them for, andmay make of them. The angel directs her to a present supply. Many whohave reason to be comforted, go mourning from day to day, because theydo not see the reason they have for comfort. There is a well of waternear them in the covenant of grace, but they are not aware of it, tillthe same God that opened their eyes to see their wound, opens them tosee their remedy. Paran was a wild place, fit for a wild man; such asIshmael. Those who are born after the flesh, take up with thewilderness of this world, while the children of the promise aim at theheavenly Canaan, and cannot be at rest till they are there. Yet God waswith the lad; his outward welfare was owing to this.
Gen 21:22-34	<br>Abimelech felt sure that the promises of God would be fulfilled toAbraham. It is wise to connect ourselves with those who are blessed ofGod; and we ought to requite kindness to those who have been kind tous. Wells of water are scarce and valuable in eastern countries.Abraham took care to have his title to the well allowed, to preventdisputes in future. No more can be expected from an honest man thanthat he be ready to do right, as soon as he knows he has done wrong.Abraham, being now in a good neighbourhood, stayed a great while there.There he made, not only a constant practice, but an open profession ofhis religion. There he called on the name of the Lord, as theeverlasting God; probably in the grove he planted, which was his placeof prayer. Abraham kept up public worship, in which his neighboursmight join. Good men should do all they can to make others so. Whereverwe sojourn, we must neither neglect nor be ashamed of the worship ofJehovah.
Gen 22:1,2	<br>We never are secure from trials In Hebrew, to tempt, and to try, or toprove, are expressed by the same word. Every trial is indeed atemptation, and tends to show the dispositions of the heart, whetherholy or unholy. But God proved Abraham, not to draw him to sin, asSatan tempts. Strong faith is often exercised with strong trials, andput upon hard services. The command to offer up his son, is given insuch language as makes the trial more grievous; every word here is asword. Observe, 1. The person to be offered: Take thy son; not thybullocks and thy lambs. How willingly would Abraham have parted withthem all to redeem Isaac! Thy son; not thy servant. Thine only son;thine only son by Sarah. Take Isaac, that son whom thou lovest. 2. Theplace: three days' journey off; so that Abraham might have time toconsider, and might deliberately obey. 3. The manner: Offer him for aburnt-offering; not only kill his son, his Isaac, but kill him as asacrifice; kill him with all that solemn pomp and ceremony, with whichhe used to offer his burnt-offerings.
Gen 22:3-10	<br>Never was any gold tried in so hot a fire. Who but Abraham would nothave argued with God? Such would have been the thought of a weak heart;but Abraham knew that he had to do with a God, even Jehovah. Faith hadtaught him not to argue, but to obey. He is sure that what God commandsis good; that what he promises cannot be broken. In matters of God,whoever consults with flesh and blood, will never offer up his Isaac toGod. The good patriarch rises early, and begins his sad journey. Andnow he travels three days, and Isaac still is in his sight! Misery ismade worse when long continued. The expression, We will come again toyou, shows that Abraham expected that Isaac, being raised from thedead, would return with him. It was a very affecting question thatIsaac asked him, as they were going together: "My father," said Isaac;it was a melting word, which, one would think, should strike deeper inthe heart of Abraham, than his knife could in the heart of Isaac. Yethe waits for his son's question. Then Abraham, where he meant not,prophesies: "My son, God will provide a lamb for a burnt-offering." TheHoly Spirit, by his mouth, seems to predict the Lamb of God, which hehas provided, and which taketh away the sin of the world. Abraham laysthe wood in order for his Isaac's funeral pile, and now tells him theamazing news: Isaac, thou art the lamb which God has provided! Abraham,no doubt, comforting him with the same hopes with which he himself byfaith was comforted. Yet it is necessary that the sacrifice be bound.The great Sacrifice, which, in the fulness of time, was to be offeredup, must be bound, and so must Isaac. This being done, Abraham takesthe knife, and stretches out his hand to give the fatal blow. Here isan act of faith and obedience, which deserves to be a spectacle to God,angels, and men. God, by his providence, calls us to part with an Isaacsometimes, and we must do it with cheerful submission to his holy will,1Sa 3:18.
Gen 22:11-14	<br>It was not God's intention that Isaac should actually be sacrificed,yet nobler blood than that of animals, in due time, was to be shed forsin, even the blood of the only begotten Son of God. But in the meanwhile God would not in any case have human sacrifices used, anothersacrifice is provided. Reference must be had to the promised Messiah,the blessed Seed. Christ was sacrificed in our stead, as this raminstead of Isaac, and his death was our discharge. And observe, thatthe temple, the place of sacrifice, was afterwards built upon this samemount Moriah; and Calvary, where Christ was crucified, was near. A newname was given to that place, for the encouragement of all believers,to the end of the world, cheerfully to trust in God, and obey him.Jehovah-jireh, the Lord will provide; probably alluding to what Abrahamhad said, God will provide himself a lamb. The Lord will always havehis eye upon his people, in their straits and distresses, that he maygive them seasonable help.
Gen 22:15-19	<br>There are high declarations of God's favour to Abraham in thisconfirmation of the covenant with him, exceeding any he had yet beenblessed with. Those that are willing to part with any thing for God,shall have it made up to them with unspeakable advantage. The promise,
Gen 22:18), doubtless points at the Messiah, and the grace of thegospel. Hereby we know the loving-kindness of God our Saviour towardssinful man, in that he hath not withheld his Son, his only Son, fromus. Hereby we perceive the love of Christ, in that he gave himself asacrifice for our sins. Yet he lives, and calls to sinners to come tohim, and partake of his blood-bought salvation. He calls to hisredeemed people to rejoice in him, and to glorify him. What then shallwe render for all his benefits? Let his love constrain us to live notto ourselves, but to Him who died for us, and rose again. Admiring andadoring His grace, let us devote our all to his service, who laid downhis life for our salvation. Whatever is dearest to us upon earth is ourIsaac. And the only way for us to find comfort in an earthly thing, isto give it by faith into the hands of God. Yet remember that Abrahamwas not justified by his readiness to obey, but by the infinitely morenoble obedience of Jesus Christ; his faith receiving this, relying onthis, rejoicing in this, disposed and made him able for such wonderfulself-denial and duty. (Ge 22:20-24)	
Gen 22:20-24	<br>This chapter ends with some account of Nahor's family, who had settledat Haran. This seems to be given for the connexion which it had withthe church of God. From thence Isaac and Jacob took wives; and beforethe account of those events this list is recorded. It shows that thoughAbraham saw his own family highly honoured with privileges, admittedinto covenant, and blessed with the assurance of the promise, yet hedid not look with disdain upon his relations, but was glad to hear ofthe increase and welfare of their families.
Gen 23:1-13	<br>The longest life must shortly come to a close. Blessed be God thatthere is a world where sin, death, vanity, and vexation cannot enter.Blessed be his name, that even death cannot part believers from unionwith Christ. Those whom we most love, yea, even our own bodies, whichwe so care for, must soon become loathsome lumps of clays, and beburied out of sight. How loose then should we be to all earthlyattachments and adornments! Let us seek rather that our souls beadorned with heavenly graces. Abraham rendered honour and respect tothe princes of Heth, although of the ungodly Canaanites. The religionof the Bible enjoins to pay due respect to all in authority, withoutflattering their persons, or countenancing their crimes if they areunworthy characters. And the noble generosity of these Canaanitesshames and condemns the closeness, selfishness, and ill-humour of manythat call themselves Israelites. It was not in pride that Abrahamrefused the gift, because he scorned to be beholden to Ephron; but injustice and in prudence. Abraham was able to pay for the field, andtherefore would not take advantage of Ephron's generosity. Honesty, aswell as honour, forbids us to take advantage of our neighbour'sliberality, and to impose, upon those who give freely.
Gen 23:14-20	<br>Prudence, as well as justice, directs us to be fair and open in ourdealings; cheating bargains will not bear the light. Abraham, withoutfraud or delay, pays the money. He pays it at once in full, withoutkeeping any part back; and by weight, current money with the merchant,without deceit. See how anciently money was used for the help of trade,and how honestly it should be paid when it is due. Though all the landof Canaan was Abraham by promise, yet the time of his possessing it notbeing come, what he had occasion for he bought and paid for. Dominionis not founded in grace. The saints' title to an eternal inheritancedoes not entitle them to the possessions of this world, nor justifythem in doing wrong. Ephron honestly and fairly makes a good title tothe land. As that which is bought, must be honestly paid for, so thatwhich is sold, must be honestly delivered and secured. Let us manageour concerns with punctuality and exactness, in order to avoidcontention. Abraham buried Sarah in cave. or vault, which was in thepurchased field. It would tend to endear the land to his posterity. Andit is worth noting, that a burying-place was the only piece of the landwhich Abraham possessed in Canaan. Those who have least of this earth,find a grave in it. This sepulchre was at the end of the field;whatever our possessions are, there is a burial-place at the end ofthem. It was a token of his belief and expectation of the resurrection.Abraham is contented to be still a pilgrim while he lives, but securesa place where, when he dies, his flesh may rest in hope. After all, thechief concern is, with whom we shall rise.
Gen 24:1-9	<br>The effect of good example, good teaching, and the worship of God in afamily, will generally appear in the piety, faithfulness, prudence, andaffection of the servants. To live in such families, or to have suchservants, both are blessings from God which should be highly valued,and thankfully acknowledged. But no concern in life is of greaterimportance to ourselves, to others, or to the church of God, thanmarriage. It therefore ought always to be undertaken with much care andprudence, especially with reference to the will of God, and with prayerfor his direction and blessing. Where good parents are not consultedand regarded, the blessing of God cannot be expected. Parents, indisposing of their children, should carefully consult the welfare oftheir souls, and their furtherance in the way to heaven. Observe thecharge Abraham gave to a good servant, one whose conduct, faithfulness,and affection, to him and his family, he had long known. Observe also,that Abraham remembers that God had wonderfully brought him out of theland of his birth, by the call of his grace; and therefore doubts notbut He will prosper his care, not to bring his son thither again. Godwill cause that to end in our comfort, in which we sincerely aim at hisglory.
Gen 24:10-28	<br>Abraham's servant devoutly acknowledged God. We have leave to beparticular in recommending our affairs to the care of Divineprovidence. He proposes a sign, not that he intended to proceed nofurther, if not gratified in it; but it is a prayer that God wouldprovide a good wife for his young master; and that was a good prayer.She should be simple, industrious, humble, cheerful, serviceable, andhospitable. Whatever may be the fashion, common sense, as well aspiety, tells us, these are the proper qualifications for a wife andmother; for one who is to be a companion to her husband, the manager ofdomestic concerns, and trusted to form the minds of children. When thesteward came to seek a wife for his master, he did not go to places ofamusement and sinful pleasure, and pray that he might meet one there,but to the well of water, expecting to find one there employed aright.He prayed that God would please to make his way in this matter plainand clear before him. Our times are in God's hand; not only eventsthemselves, but the times of them. We must take heed of being over-boldin urging what God should do, lest the event should weaken our faith,rather than strengthen it. But God owned him by making his way clear.Rebekah, in all respects, answered the characters he sought for in thewoman that was to be his master's wife. When she came to the well, shewent down and filled her pitcher, and came up to go home with it. Shedid not stand to gaze upon the strange man his camels, but minded herbusiness, and would not have been diverted from it but by anopportunity of doing good. She did not curiously or confidently enterinto discourse with him, but answered him modestly. Being satisfiedthat the Lord had heard his prayer, he gave the damsel some ornamentsworn in eastern countries; asking at the same time respecting herkindred. On learning that she was of his master's relations, he boweddown his head and worshipped, blessing God. His words were addressed tothe Lord, but being spoken in the hearing of Rebekah, she couldperceive who he was, and whence he came.
Gen 24:29-53	<br>The making up of the marriage between Isaac and Rebekah is told veryparticularly. We are to notice God's providence in the common events ofhuman life, and in them to exercise prudence and other graces. Labanwent to ask Abraham's servant in, but not till he saw the ear-ring, andbracelet upon his sister's hands. We know Laban's character, by hisconduct afterwards, and may think that he would not have been so freeto entertain him, if he had not hoped to be well rewarded for it. Theservant was intent upon his business. Though he was come off a journey,and come to a good house, he would not eat till he had told his errand.The doing our work, and the fulfilling our trusts, either for God orman, should be preferred by us before our food: it was our Saviour'smeat and drink, Joh 4:34. He tells them the charge his master had givenhim, with the reason of it. He relates what had happened at the well,to further the proposal, plainly showing the finger of God in it. Thoseevents which to us seem the effect of choice, contrivance, or chance,are "appointed out" of God. This hinders not, but rather encourages theuse of all proper means. They freely and cheerfully close with theproposal; and any matter is likely to be comfortable, when it proceedsfrom the Lord. Abraham's servant thankfully acknowledges the goodsuccess he had met with. He was a humble man, and humble men are notashamed to own their situation in life, whatever it may be. All ourtemporal concerns are sweet if intermixed with godliness.
Gen 24:54-67	<br>Abraham's servant, as one that chose his work before his pleasure, wasfor hastening home. Lingering and loitering no way become a wise andgood man who is faithful to his duty. As children ought not to marrywithout their parents' consent, so parents ought not to marry themwithout their own. Rebekah consented, not only to go, but to go atonce. The goodness of Rebekah's character shows there was nothing wrongin her answer, though it be not agreeable to modern customs among us.We may hope that she had such an idea of the religion and godliness inthe family she was to go to, as made her willing to forget her ownpeople and her father's house. Her friends dismiss her with suitableattendants, and with hearty good wishes. They blessed Rebekah. When ourrelations are entering into a new condition, we ought by prayer tocommend them to the blessing and grace of God. Isaac was well employedwhen he met Rebekah. He went out to take the advantage of a silentevening, and a solitary place, for meditation and prayer; those divineexercises by which we converse with God and our own hearts. Holy soulslove retirement; it will do us good to be often alone, if rightlyemployed; and we are never less alone than when alone. Observe what anaffectionate son Isaac was: it was about three years since his motherdied, and yet he was not, till now, comforted. See also what anaffectionate husband he was to his wife. Dutiful sons promise fair tobe affectionate husbands; he that fills up his first station in lifewith honour, is likely to do the same in those that follow.
Gen 25:1-10	<br>All the days, even of the best and greatest saints, are not remarkabledays; some slide on silently; such were these last days of Abraham.Here is an account of Abraham's children by Keturah, and thedisposition which he made of his estate. After the birth of these sons,he set his house in order, with prudence and justice. He did this whilehe yet lived. It is wisdom for men to do what they find to do whilethey live, as far as they can. Abraham lived 175 years; just onehundred years after he came to Canaan; so long he was a sojourner in astrange country. Whether our stay in this life be long or short, itmatters but little, provided we leave behind us a testimony to thefaithfulness and goodness of the Lord, and a good example to ourfamilies. We are told that his sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him. Itseems that Abraham had himself brought them together while he lived.Let us not close the history of the life of Abraham without blessingGod for such a testimony of the triumph of faith.
Gen 25:11-18	<br>Ishmael had twelve sons, whose families became distinct tribes. Theypeopled a very large country that lay between Egypt and Assyria, calledArabia. The number and strength of this family were the fruit of thepromise, made to Hagar and to Abraham, concerning Ishmael.
Gen 25:19-26	<br>Isaac seems not to have been much tried, but to have spent his days inquietness. Jacob and Esau were prayed for; their parents, after beinglong childless, obtained them by prayer. The fulfilment of God'spromise is always sure, yet it is often slow. The faith of believers istried, their patience exercised, and mercies long waited for are morewelcome when they come. Isaac and Rebekah kept in view the promise ofall nations being blessed in their posterity, therefore were not onlydesirous of children, but anxious concerning every thing which seemedto mark their future character. In all our doubts we should inquire ofthe Lord by prayer. In many of our conflicts with sin and temptation,we may adopt Rebekah's words, "If it be so, why am I thus?" If a childof God, why so careless or carnal? If not a child of God, why so afraidof, or so burdened with sin?
Gen 25:27,28	<br>Esau hunted the beasts of the field with dexterity and success, till hebecame a conqueror, ruling over his neighbours. Jacob was a plain man,one that liked the true delights of retirement, better than allpretended pleasures. He was a stranger and a pilgrim in his spirit, anda shepherd all his days. Isaac and Rebekah had but these two children,one was the father's darling, and the other the mother's. And thoughgodly parents must feel their affections most drawn over towards agodly child, yet they will not show partiality. Let their affectionslead them to do what is just and equal to every child, or evils willarise.
Gen 25:29-34	<br>We have here the bargain made between Jacob and Esau about the right,which was Esau's by birth, but Jacob's by promise. It was for aspiritual privilege; and we see Jacob's desire of the birth-right, buthe sought to obtain it by crooked courses, not like his character as aplain man. He was right, that he coveted earnestly the best gifts; hewas wrong, that he took advantage of his brother's need. Theinheritance of their father's worldly goods did not descend to Jacob,and was not meant in this proposal. But it includeth the futurepossession of the land of Canaan by his children's children, and thecovenant made with Abraham as to Christ the promised Seed. BelievingJacob valued these above all things; unbelieving Esau despised them.Yet although we must be of Jacob's judgment in seeking the birth-right,we ought carefully to avoid all guile, in seeking to obtain even thegreatest advantages. Jacob's pottage pleased Esau's eye. "Give me someof that red;" for this he was called Edom, or Red. Gratifying thesensual appetite ruins thousands of precious souls. When men's heartswalk after their own eyes, Job 31:7, and when they serve their ownbellies, they are sure to be punished. If we use ourselves to denyourselves, we break the force of most temptations. It cannot besupposed that Esau was dying of hunger in Isaac's house. The wordssignify, I am going towards death; he seems to mean, I shall never liveto inherit Canaan, or any of those future supposed blessings; and whatsignifies it who has them when I am dead and gone. This would be thelanguage of profaneness, with which the apostle brands him, Heb 12:16;and this contempt of the birth-right is blamed, 
Gen 25:34	<br>It is thegreatest folly to part with our interest in God, and Christ, andheaven, for the riches, honours, and pleasures of this world; it is asbad a bargain as his who sold a birth-right for a dish of pottage. Esauate and drank, pleased his palate, satisfied his appetite, and thencarelessly rose up and went his way, without any serious thought, orany regret, about the bad bargain he had made. Thus Esau despised hisbirth-right. By his neglect and contempt afterwards, and by justifyinghimself in what he had done, he put the bargain past recall. People areruined, not so much by doing what is amiss, as by doing it and notrepenting of it.
Gen 26:1-5	<br>Isaac had been trained up in a believing dependence upon the Divinegrant of the land of Canaan to him and his heirs; and now that there isa famine in the land, Isaac still cleaves to the covenant. The realworth of God's promises cannot be lessened to a believer by any crossprovidences that may befall him. If God engage to be with us, and weare where he would have us to be, nothing but our own unbelief anddistrust can prevent our comfort. The obedience of Abraham to theDivine command, was evidence of that faith, whereby, as a sinner, hewas justified before God, and the effect of that love whereby truefaith works. God testifies that he approved this obedience, toencourage others, especially Isaac.
Gen 26:6-11	<br>There is nothing in Isaac's denial of his wife to be imitated, nor evenexcused. The temptation of Isaac is the same as that which overcame hisfather, and that in two instances. This rendered his conduct thegreater sin. The falls of those who are gone before us are so manyrocks on which others have split; and the recording of them is likeplacing buoys to save future mariners. This Abimelech was not the samethat lived in Abraham's days, but both acted rightly. The sins ofprofessors shame them before those that are not themselves religious.
Gen 26:12-17	<br>God blessed Isaac. Be it observed, for the encouragement of poortenants who occupy other people's lands, and are honest andindustrious, that God blessed him with a great increase. ThePhilistines envied Isaac. It is an instance of the vanity of the world;for the more men have of it, the more they are envied, and exposed tocensure and injury. Also of the corruption of nature; for that is anill principle indeed, which makes men grieve at the good of others.They made Isaac go out of their country. That wisdom which is fromabove, will teach us to give up our right, and to draw back fromcontentions. If we are wrongfully driven from one place, the Lord willmake room for us in another.
Gen 26:18-25	<br>Isaac met with much opposition in digging wells. Two were calledContention and Hatred. See the nature of worldly things; they makequarrels, and are occasions of strife; and what is often the lot of themost quiet and peaceable; those who avoid striving, yet cannot avoidbeing striven with. And what a mercy it is to have plenty of water; tohave it without striving for it! The more common this mercy is, themore reason to be thankful for it. At length Isaac digged a well, forwhich they strove not. Those that study to be quiet, seldom fail ofbeing so. When men are false and unkind, still God is faithful andgracious; and his time to show himself so is, when we are mostdisappointed by men. The same night that Isaac came weary and uneasy toBeer-sheba, God brought comforts to his soul. Those may remove withcomfort who are sure of God's presence.
Gen 26:26-33	<br>When a man's ways please the Lord, he maketh even his enemies to be atpeace with him, Pr 16:7. Kings' hearts are in his hands, and when hepleases, he can turn them to favour his people. It is not wrong tostand upon our guard in dealing with those who have acted unfairly. ButIsaac did not insist on the unkindnesses they had done him; he freelyentered into friendship with them. Religion teaches us to beneighbourly, and, as much as in us lies, to live peaceable with allmen. Providence smiled upon what Isaac did; God blessed his labours.
Gen 26:34,35	<br>Esau was foolish in marrying two wives together, and still more inmarrying Canaanites, strangers to the blessing of Abraham, and subjectto the curse of Noah. It grieved his parents that he married withouttheir advice and consent. It grieved them that he married among thosewho had no religion. Children have little reason to expect God'sblessing who do that which is a grief of mind to good parents.
Gen 27:1-5	<br>The promises of the Messiah, and of the land of Canaan, had come downto Isaac. Isaac being now about 135 years of age, and his sons about75, and not duly considering the Divine word concerning his two sons,that the elder should serve the younger, resolved to put all the honourand power that were in the promise, upon Esau his eldest son. We arevery apt to take measures rather from our own reason than from Divinerevelation, and thereby often miss our way.
Gen 27:6-17	<br>Rebekah knew that the blessing was intended for Jacob, and expected hewould have it. But she wronged Isaac by putting a cheat on him; shewronged Jacob by tempting him to wickedness. She put a stumbling-blockin Esau's way, and gave him a pretext for hatred to Jacob and toreligion. All were to be blamed. It was one of those crooked measuresoften adopted to further the Divine promises; as if the end wouldjustify, or excuse wrong means. Thus many have acted wrong, under theidea of being useful in promoting the cause of Christ. The answer toall such things is that which God addressed to Abraham, I am GodAlmighty; walk before me and be thou perfect. And it was a very rashspeech of Rebekah, "Upon me be thy curse, my son." Christ has borne thecurse of the law for all who take upon them the yoke of the command,the command of the gospel. But it is too daring for any creature tosay, Upon me be thy curse.
Gen 27:18-29	<br>Jacob, with some difficulty, gained his point, and got the blessing.This blessing is in very general terms. No mention is made of thedistinguishing mercies in the covenant with Abraham. This might beowing to Isaac having Esau in his mind, though it was Jacob who wasbefore him. He could not be ignorant how Esau had despised the bestthings. Moreover, his attachment to Esau, so as to disregard the mindof God, must have greatly weakened his own faith in these things. Itmight therefore be expected, that leanness would attend his blessing,agreeing with the state of his mind.
Gen 27:30-40	<br>When Esau understood that Jacob had got the blessing, he cried with agreat and exceeding bitter cry. The day is coming, when those that nowmake light of the blessings of the covenant, and sell their title tospiritual blessings for that which is of no value, will, in vain, askurgently for them. Isaac, when made sensible of the deceit practised onhim, trembled exceedingly. Those who follow the choice of their ownaffections, rather than the Divine will, get themselves intoperplexity. But he soon recovers, and confirms the blessing he hadgiven to Jacob, saying, I have blessed him, and he shall be blessed.Those who part with their wisdom and grace, their faith and a goodconscience, for the honours, wealth, or pleasures of this world,however they feign a zeal for the blessing, have judged themselvesunworthy of it, and their doom shall be accordingly. A common blessingwas bestowed upon Esau. This he desired. Faint desires of happiness,without right choice of the end, and right use of the means, deceivemany unto their own ruin. Multitudes go to hell with their mouths fullof good wishes. The great difference is, that there is nothing inEsau's blessing which points at Christ; and without that, the fatnessof the earth, and the plunder of the field, will stand in little stead.Thus Isaac, by faith, blessed both his sons, according as their lotshould be.
Gen 27:41-46	<br>Esau bore malice to Jacob on account of the blessing he had obtained.Thus he went in the way of Cain, who slew his brother, because hegained that acceptance with God of which he had rendered himselfunworthy. Esau aimed to prevent Jacob or his seed from having thedominion, by taking away his life. Men may fret at God's counsels, butcannot change them. To prevent mischief, Rebekah warned Jacob of hisdanger, and advised him to withdraw for his safety. We must not presumetoo far upon the wisdom and resolution, even of the most hopeful andpromising children; but care must be taken to keep them out of the wayof evil. When reading this chapter, we should not fail to observe, thatwe must not follow even the best of men further than they act accordingto the law of God. We must not do evil that good may come. And thoughGod overruled the bad actions recorded in this chapter, to fulfil hispurposes, yet we see his judgment of them, in the painful consequencesto all the parties concerned. It was the peculiar privilege andadvantage of Jacob to convey these spiritual blessings to all nations.The Christ, the Saviour of the world, was to be born of some onefamily; and Jacob's was preferred to Esau's, out of the good pleasureof Almighty God, who is certainly the best judge of what is fit, andhas an undoubted right to dispense his favours as he sees proper, Ro9:12-15.
Gen 28:1-5	<br>Jacob had blessings promised both as to this world and that which is tocome; yet goes out to a hard service. This corrected him for the fraudon his father. The blessing shall be conferred on him, yet he shallsmart for the indirect course taken to obtain it. Jacob is dismissed byhis father with a solemn charge. He must not take a wife of thedaughters of Canaan: those who profess religion, should not marry withthose that care not for religion. Also with a solemn blessing. Isaachad before blessed him unwittingly; now he does it designedly. Thisblessing is more full than the former; it is a gospel blessing. Thispromise looks as high as heaven, of which Canaan was a type. That wasthe better country which Jacob and the other patriarchs had in view.
Gen 28:6-9	<br>Good examples impress even the profane and malicious. But Esau thought,by pleasing his parents in one thing, to atone for other wrong doings.Carnal hearts are apt to think themselves as good as they should be,because in some one matter they are not so bad as they have been.
Gen 28:10-15	<br>Jacob's conduct hitherto, as recorded, was not that of one who simplyfeared and trusted in God. But now in trouble, obliged to flee, helooked only to God to make him to dwell in safety, and he could liedown and sleep in the open air with his head upon a stone. Any truebeliever would be willing to take up with Jacob's pillow, provided hemight have Jacob's vision. God's time to visit his people with hiscomforts, is, when they are most destitute of other comforts, and othercomforters. Jacob saw a ladder which reached from earth to heaven, theangels going up and coming down, and God himself at the head of it.This represents, 1. The providence of God, by which there is a constantintercourse kept up between heaven and earth. This let Jacob know thathe had both a good guide and a good guard. 2. The mediation of Christ.He is this ladder; the foot on earth in his human nature, the top inheaven in his Divine nature. Christ is the Way; all God's favours cometo us, and all our services go to him, by Christ, Joh 1:51. By thisway, sinners draw near to the throne of grace with acceptance. By faithwe perceive this way, and in prayer we approach by it. In answer toprayer we receive all needful blessings of providence and grace. Wehave no way of getting to heaven but by Christ. And when the soul, byfaith, can see these things, then every place will become pleasant, andevery prospect joyful. He will never leave us, until his last promiseis accomplished in our everlasting happiness. God now spake comfortablyto Jacob. He spake from the head of the ladder. All the glad tidings wereceive from heaven come through Jesus Christ. The Messiah should comefrom Jacob. Christ is the great blessing of the world. All that areblessed, are blessed in him, and none of any family are shut out fromblessedness in him, but those that shut out themselves. Jacob had tofear danger from his brother Esau; but God promises to keep him. He hada long journey before him; to an unknown country; but, Behold, I amwith thee, and God promises to bring him back again to this land. Heseemed to be forsaken of all his friends; but God gives him thisassurance, I will not leave thee. Whom God loves, he never leaves.
Gen 28:16-19	<br>God manifested himself and his favour, to Jacob, when he was asleep.The Spirit, like the wind, blows when and where it listeth, and God'sgrace, like the dew, tarrieth not for the sons of men. Jacob sought toimprove the visit God had made him. Wherever we are, in the city or inthe desert, in the house or in the field, in the shop or in the street,we may keep up our intercourse with Heaven, if it is not our own fault.But the more we see of God, the more cause we see for holy tremblingbefore him.
Gen 28:20-22	<br>Jacob made a solemn vow on this occasion. In this observe, 1. Jacob'sfaith. He trusts that God will be with him, and will keep him; hedepends upon it. 2. Jacob's moderation in his desires. He asks not forsoft clothing and dainty meat. If God give us much, we are bound to bethankful, and to use it for him; if he gives us but little, we arebound to be content, and cheerfully to enjoy him in it. 3. Jacob'spiety, and his regard to God, appear in what he desired, that God wouldbe with him, and keep him. We need desire no more to make us easy andhappy. Also his resolution is, to cleave to the Lord, as his God incovenant. When we receive more than common mercy from God, we shouldabound in gratitude to him. The tenth is a fit proportion to be devotedto God, and employed for him; though it may be more or less, as Godprospers us, 1Co 16:2. Let us then remember our Bethels, how we standengaged by solemn vows to yield ourselves to the Lord, to take him forour God, and to devote all we have and are to his glory!
Gen 29:1-8	<br>Jacob proceeded cheerfully in his journey, after the sweet communion hehad with God at Beth-el. Providence brought him to the field where hisuncle's flocks were to be watered. What is said of the care of theshepherds for their sheep, may remind us of the tender concern whichour Lord Jesus, the great Shepherd of the sheep, has for his flock thechurch; for he is the good Shepherd, that knows his sheep, and is knownof them. The stone at the well's mouth was to secure it; water wasscarce, it was not there for every one's use: but separate interestsshould not take us from helping one another. When all the shepherdscame together with their flocks, then, like loving neighbours, theywatered their flocks together. The law of kindness in the tongue has acommanding power, Pr 31:26. Jacob was civil to these strangers, and hefound them civil to him.
Gen 29:9-14	<br>See Rachel's humility and industry. Nobody needs to be ashamed ofhonest, useful labour, nor ought it to hinder any one's preferment.When Jacob understood that this was his kinswoman, he was very ready toserve her. Laban, though not the best humoured, bade him welcome, andwas satisfied with the account Jacob gave of himself. While we avoidbeing foolishly ready to believe every thing which is told us, we musttake heed of being uncharitably suspicious.
Gen 29:15-30	<br>During the month that Jacob spent as a guest, he was not idle. Whereverwe are, it is good to employ ourselves in some useful business. Labanwas desirous that Jacob should continue with him. Inferior relationsmust not be imposed upon; it is our duty to reward them. Jacob madeknown to Laban the affection he had for his daughter Rachel. And havingno wordly goods with which to endow her, he promises seven years'service Love makes long and hard services short and easy; hence we readof the labour of love, Heb 6:10. If we know how to value the happinessof heaven, the sufferings of this present time will be as nothing tous. An age of work will be but as a few days to those that love God,and long for Christ's appearing. Jacob, who had imposed upon hisfather, is imposed upon by Laban, his father-in-law, by a likedeception. Herein, how unrighteous soever Laban was, the Lord wasrighteous: see Jud 1:7. Even the righteous, if they take a false step,are sometimes thus recompensed in the earth. And many who are not, likeJacob, in their marriage, disappointed in person, soon find themselves,as much to their grief, disappointed in the character. The choice ofthat relation ought to be made with good advice and thought on bothsides. There is reason to believe that Laban's excuse was not true. Hisway of settling the matter made bad worse. Jacob was drawn into thedisquiet of multiplying wives. He could not refuse Rachel, for he hadespoused her; still less could he refuse Leah. As yet there was noexpress command against marrying more than one wife. It was in thepatriarchs a sin of ignorance; but it will not justify the likepractice now, when God's will is plainly made known by the Divine law,Le 18:18, and more fully since, by our Saviour, that one man and womanonly must be joined together, 1Co 7:2.
Gen 29:31-35	<br>The names Leah gave her children, expressed her respect and regard,both to God and to her husband. Reuben, or See a son, with thisthought, Now will my husband love me; Levi, or joined, expecting, Nowwill my husband be joined unto me. Mutual affection is both the dutyand comfort of the married relation; and yoke-fellows should study torecommend themselves to each other, 1Co 7:33,34. She thankfullyacknowledges the kind providence of God in hearing her. Whateversupports and comforts us under afflictions, or tends to our deliverancefrom them, God must be owned in it. Her fourth son she called Judah, orpraise, saying, Now will I praise the Lord. This was he, of whom, asconcerning the flesh, Christ came. Whatever is the matter of ourrejoicing, ought to be the matter of our thanksgiving. Fresh favoursshould quicken us to praise God for former favours; Now will I praisethe Lord more and better than I have done. All our praises must centrein Christ, both as the matter of them, and as the Mediator of them. Hedescended after the flesh from him whose name was "Praise," and He isour praise. Is Christ formed in my heart? Now will I praise the Lord.
Gen 30:1-13	<br>Rachel envied her sister: envy is grieving at the good of another, thanwhich no sin is more hateful to God, or more hurtful to our neighboursand ourselves. She considered not that God made the difference, andthat in other things she had the advantage. Let us carefully watchagainst all the risings and workings of this passion in our minds. Letnot our eye be evil towards any of our fellow-servants, because ourMaster's is good. Jacob loved Rachel, and therefore reproved her forwhat she said amiss. Faithful reproofs show true affection. God may beto us instead of any creature; but it is sin and folly to place anycreature in God's stead, and to place that confidence in any creature,which should be placed in God only. At the persuasion of Rachel, Jacobtook Bilhah her handmaid to wife, that, according to the usage of thosetimes, her children might be owned as her mistress's children. Had notRachel's heart been influenced by evil passions, she would have thoughther sister's children nearer to her, and more entitled to her care thanBilhah's. But children whom she had a right to rule, were moredesirable to her than children she had more reason to love. As an earlyinstance of her power over these children, she takes pleasure in givingthem names that carry in them marks of rivalry with her sister. Seewhat roots of bitterness envy and strife are, and what mischief theymake among relations. At the persuasion of Leah, Jacob took Zilpah herhandmaid to wife also. See the power of jealousy and rivalship, andadmire the wisdom of the Divine appointment, which joins together oneman and one woman only; for God hath called us to peace and purity.
Gen 30:14-24	<br>The desire, good in itself, but often too great and irregular, of beingthe mother of the promised Seed, with the honour of having manychildren, and the reproach of being barren, were causes of thisunbecoming contest between the sisters. The truth appears to be, thatthey were influenced by the promises of God to Abraham; whose posteritywere promised the richest blessings, and from whom the Messiah was todescend.
Gen 30:25-43	<br>The fourteen years being gone, Jacob was willing to depart without anyprovision, except God's promise. But he had in many ways a just claimon Laban's substance, and it was the will of God that he should beprovided for from it. He referred his cause to God, rather than agreefor stated wages with Laban, whose selfishness was very great. And itwould appear that he acted honestly, when none but those of the coloursfixed upon should be found among his cattle. Laban selfishly thoughtthat his cattle would produce few different in colour from their own.Jacob's course after this agreement has been considered an instance ofhis policy and management. But it was done by intimation from God, andas a token of his power. The Lord will one way or another plead thecause of the oppressed, and honour those who simply trust hisprovidence. Neither could Laban complain of Jacob, for he had nothingmore than was freely agreed that he should have; nor was he injured,but greatly benefitted by Jacob's services. May all our mercies bereceived with thanksgiving and prayer, that coming from his bounty,they may lead to his praise.
Gen 31:1-21	<br>The affairs of these families are related very minutely, while (whatare called) the great events of states and kingdoms at that period, arenot mentioned. The Bible teaches people the common duties of life, howto serve God, how to enjoy the blessings he bestows, and to do good inthe various stations and duties of life. Selfish men considerthemselves robbed of all that goes past them, and covetousness willeven swallow up natural affection. Men's overvaluing worldly wealth isthat error which is the root of covetousness, envy, and all evil. Themen of the world stand in each other's way, and every one seems to betaking away from the rest; hence discontent, envy, and discord. Butthere are possessions that will suffice for all; happy they who seekthem in the first place. In all our removals we should have respect tothe command and promise of God. If He be with us, we need not fear. Theperils which surround us are so many, that nothing else can reallyencourage our hearts. To remember favoured seasons of communion withGod, is very refreshing when in difficulties; and we should oftenrecollect our vows, that we fail not to fulfil them.
Gen 31:22-35	<br>God can put a bridle in the mouth of wicked men, to restrain theirmalice, though he do not change their hearts. Though they have no loveto God's people, they will pretend to it, and try to make a merit ofnecessity. Foolish Laban! to call those things his gods which could bestolen! Enemies may steal our goods, but not our God. Here Laban laysto Jacob's charge things that he knew not. Those who commit their causeto God, are not forbidden to plead it themselves with meekness andfear. When we read of Rachel's stealing her father's images, what ascene of iniquity opens! The family of Nahor, who left the idolatrousChaldees; is this family itself become idolatrous? It is even so. Thetruth seems to be, that they were like some in after-times, who swareby the Lord and by Malcham, Zep 1:5; and like others in our times, whowish to serve both God and mammon. Great numbers will acknowledge thetrue God in words, but their hearts and houses are the abodes ofspiritual idolatry. When a man gives himself up to covetousness, likeLaban, the world is his god; and he has only to reside among grossidolaters in order to become one, or at least a favourer of theirabominations.
Gen 31:36-42	<br>If Jacob were willingly consumed with heat in the day, and frost bynight, to become the son-in-law of Laban, what should we refuse toendure, to become the sons of God? Jacob speaks of God as the God ofhis father; he thought himself unworthy to be regarded, but was belovedfor his father's sake. He calls him the God of Abraham, and the fear ofIsaac; for Abraham was dead, and gone to that world where perfect lovecasts out fear; but Isaac was yet alive, sanctifying the Lord in hisheart, as his fear and his dread.
Gen 31:43-55	<br>Laban could neither justify himself nor condemn Jacob, thereforedesires to hear no more of that matter. He is not willing to ownhimself in fault, as he ought to have done. But he proposes a covenantof friendship between them, to which Jacob readily agrees. A heap ofstones was raised, to keep up the memory of the event, writing beingthen not known or little used. A sacrifice of peace offerings wasoffered. Peace with God puts true comfort into our peace with ourfriends. They did eat bread together, partaking of the feast upon thesacrifice. In ancient times covenants of friendship were ratified bythe parties eating and drinking together. God is judge betweencontending parties, and he will judge righteously; whoever do wrong, itis at their peril. They gave a new name to the place, The heap ofwitness. After this angry parley, they part friends. God is oftenbetter to us than our fears, and overrules the spirits of men in ourfavour, beyond what we could have expected; for it is not in vain totrust in him.
Gen 32:1-8	<br>The angels of God appeared to Jacob, to encourage him with theassurance of the Divine protection. When God designs his people forgreat trials, he prepares them by great comforts. While Jacob, to whomthe promise belonged, had been in hard service, Esau was become aprince. Jacob sent a message, showing that he did not insist upon thebirth-right. Yielding pacifies great offences, Ec 10:4. We must notrefuse to speak respectfully, even to those unjustly angry with us.Jacob received an account of Esau's warlike preparations against him,and was greatly afraid. A lively sense of danger, and quickening feararising from it, may be found united with humble confidence in God'spower and promise.
Gen 32:9-23	<br>Times of fear should be times of prayer: whatever causes fear, shoulddrive us to our knees, to our God. Jacob had lately seen his guards ofangels, but in this distress he applied to God, not to them; he knewthey were his fellow-servants, Re 22:9. There cannot be a betterpattern for true prayer than this. Here is a thankful acknowledgementof former undeserved favours; a humble confession of unworthiness; aplain statement of his fears and distress; a full reference of thewhole affair to the Lord, and resting all his hopes on him. The best wecan say to God in prayer, is what he has said to us. Thus he made thename of the Lord his strong tower, and could not but be safe. Jacob'sfear did not make him sink into despair, nor did his prayer make himpresume upon God's mercy, without the use of means. God answers prayersby teaching us to order our affairs aright. To pacify Esau, Jacob senthim a present. We must not despair of reconciling ourselves to thosemost angry against us.
Gen 32:24-32	<br>A great while before day, Jacob being alone, more fully spread hisfears before God in prayer. While thus employed, One in the likeness ofa man wrestled with him. When the spirit helpeth our infirmities, andour earnest and vast desires can scarcely find words to utter them, andwe still mean more than we can express, then prayer is indeed wrestlingwith God. However tried or discouraged, we shall prevail; andprevailing with Him in prayer, we shall prevail against all enemiesthat strive with us. Nothing requires more vigour and unceasingexertion than wrestling. It is an emblem of the true spirit of faithand prayer. Jacob kept his ground; though the struggle continued long,this did not shake his faith, nor silence his prayer. He will have ablessing, and had rather have all his bone put out of joint than goaway without one. Those who would have the blessing of Christ, mustresolve to take no denial. The fervent prayer is the effectual prayer.The Angel puts a lasting mark of honour upon him, by changing his name.Jacob signifies a supplanter. From henceforth he shall be celebrated,not for craft and artful management, but for true valour. Thou shalt becalled Israel, a prince with God, a name greater than those of thegreat men of the earth. He is a prince indeed that is a prince withGod; those are truly honourable that are mighty in prayer. Having powerwith God, he shall have power with men too; he shall prevail, and gainEsau's favour. Jacob gives a new name to the place. He calls it Peniel,the face of God, because there he had seen the appearance of God, andobtained the favour of God. It becomes those whom God honours, toadmire his grace towards them. The Angel who wrestled with Jacob wasthe second Person in the sacred Trinity, who was afterwards Godmanifest in the flesh, and who, dwelling in human nature, is calledImmanuel, Ho 12:4,5. Jacob halted on his thigh. It might serve to keephim from being lifted up with the abundance of the revelations. The sunrose on Jacob: it is sun-rise with that soul, which has had communionwith God.
Gen 33:1-16	<br>Jacob, having by prayer committed his case to God, went on his way.Come what will, nothing can come amiss to him whose heart is fixed,trusting in God. Jacob bowed to Esau. A humble, submissive behaviourgoes far towards turning away wrath. Esau embraced Jacob. God has thehearts of all men in his hands, and can turn them when and how hepleases. It is not in vain to trust in God, and to call upon him in theday of trouble. And when a man's ways please the Lord he maketh evenhis enemies to be at peace with him. Esau receives Jacob as a brother,and much tenderness passes between them. Esau asks, Who are those withthee? To this common question, Jacob spoke like himself, like a manwhose eyes are ever directed towards the Lord. Jacob urged Esau, thoughhis fear was over, and he took his present. It is well when men'sreligion makes them generous, free-hearted, and open-handed. But Jacobdeclined Esau's offer to accompany him. It is not desirable to be toointimate with superior ungodly relations, who will expect us to join intheir vanities, or at least to wink at them, though they blame, andperhaps mock at, our religion. Such will either be a snare to us, oroffended with us. We shall venture the loss of all things, rather thanendanger our souls, if we know their value; rather than renounceChrist, if we truly love him. And let Jacob's care and tender attentionto his family and flocks remind us of the good Shepherd of our souls,who gathers the lambs with his arm, and carries them in his bosom, andgently leads those that are with young, Isa 40:11. As parents, teachersor pastors, we should all follow his example.
Gen 33:17-20	<br>Jacob did not content himself with words of thanks for God's favour tohim, but gave real thanks. Also he kept up religion, and the worship ofGod in his family. Where we have a tent, God must have an altar. Jacobdedicated this altar to the honour of El-elohe-Israel, God, the God ofIsrael; to the honour of God, the only living and true God; and to thehonour of the God of Israel, as a God in covenant with him. Israel'sGod is Israel's glory. Blessed be his name, he is still the mighty God,the God of Israel. May we praise his name, and rejoice in his love,through our pilgrimage here on earth, and for ever in the heavenlyCanaan.
Gen 34:1-19	<br>Young persons, especially females, are never so safe and well off asunder the care of pious parents. Their own ignorance, and the flatteryand artifices of designing, wicked people, who are ever laying snaresfor them, expose them to great danger. They are their own enemies ifthey desire to go abroad, especially alone, among strangers to truereligion. Those parents are very wrong who do not hinder their childrenfrom needlessly exposing themselves to danger. Indulged children, likeDinah, often become a grief and shame to their families. Her pretencewas, to see the daughters of the land, to see how they dressed, and howthey danced, and what was fashionable among them; she went to see, yetthat was not all, she went to be seen too. She went to get acquaintancewith the Canaanites, and to learn their ways. See what came of Dinah'sgadding. The beginning of sin is as the letting forth of water. Howgreat a matter does a little fire kindle! We should carefully avoid alloccasions of sin and approaches to it.
Gen 34:20-31	<br>The Shechemites submitted to the sacred rite, only to serve a turn, toplease their prince, and to enrich themselves, and it was just with Godto bring punishment upon them. As nothing secures us better than truereligion, so nothing exposes us more than religion only pretended to.But Simeon and Levi were most unrighteous. Those who act wickedly,under the pretext of religion, are the worst enemies of the truth, andharden the hearts of many to destruction. The crimes of others form noexcuse for us. Alas! how one sin leads on to another, and, like flamesof fire, spread desolation in every direction! Foolish pleasures leadto seduction; seduction produces wrath; wrath thirsts for revenge; thethirst of revenge has recourse to treachery; treachery issues inmurder; and murder is followed by other lawless actions. Were we totrace the history of unlawful commerce between the sexes, we shouldfind it, more than any other sin, ending in blood.
Gen 35:1-5	<br>Beth-el was forgotten. But as many as God loves, he will remind ofneglected duties, one way or other, by conscience or by providences.When we have vowed a vow to God, it is best not to defer the payment ofit; yet better late than never. Jacob commanded his household toprepare, not only for the journey and removal, but for religiousservices. Masters of families should use their authority to keep upreligion in their families, Jos 24:15. They must put away strange gods.In families where there is a face of religion, and an altar to God, yetmany times there is much amiss, and more strange gods than one wouldsuppose. They must be clean, and change their garments. These were butoutward ceremonies, signifying the purifying and change of the heart.What are clean clothes, and new clothes, without a clean heart, and anew heart? If Jacob had called for these idols sooner, they had partedwith them sooner. Sometimes attempts for reformation succeed betterthan we could have thought. Jacob buried their images. We must bewholly separated from our sins, as we are from those that are dead andburied out of sight. He removed from Shechem to Beth-el. Though theCanaanites were very angry against the sons of Jacob for theirbarbarous usage of the Shechemites, yet they were so kept back byDivine power, that they could not take the opportunity now offered toavenge them. The way of duty is the way of safety. When we are aboutGod's work, we are under special protection; God is with us, while weare with him; and if He be for us, who can be against us? God governsthe world more by secret terrors on men's minds than we are aware of.
Gen 35:6-15	<br>The comfort the saints have in holy ordinances, is not so much fromBeth-el, the house of God, as from El-beth-el, the God of the house.The ordinances are empty things, if we do not meet with God in them.There Jacob buried Deborah, Rebekah's nurse. She died much lamented.Old servants in a family, that have in their time been faithful anduseful, ought to be respected. God appeared to Jacob. He renewed thecovenant with him. I am God Almighty, God all-sufficient, able to makegood the promise in due time, and to support thee and provide for theein the mean time. Two things are promised; that he should be the fatherof a great nation, and that he should be the master of a good land.These two promises had a spiritual signification, which Jacob had somenotion of, though not so clear and distinct as we now have. Christ isthe promised Seed, and heaven is the promised land; the former is thefoundation, and the latter the top-stone, of all God's favours.
Gen 35:16-20	<br>Rachel had passionately said, Give me children, or else I die; and nowthat she had children, she died! The death of the body is but thedeparture of the soul to the world of spirits. When shall we learn thatit is God alone who really knows what is best for his people, and thatin all worldly affairs the safest path for the Christian is to say fromthe heart, It is the Lord, let him do what seemeth him good. Here aloneis our safety and our comfort, to know no will but his. Her dying lipscalled her newborn son Ben-oni, the son of my sorrow; and many a sonproves to be the heaviness of her that bare him. Children are enoughthe sorrow of their mothers; they should, therefore, when they grow up,study to be their joy, and so, if possible, to make them some amends.But Jacob, because he would not renew the sorrowful remembrance of themother's death every time he called his son, changed his name toBenjamin, the son of my right hand: that is, very dear to me; thesupport of my age, like the staff in my right hand.
Gen 35:21-29	<br>What a sore affliction Reuben's sin was, is shown, "and Israel heardit." No more is said, but that is enough. Reuben thought that hisfather would never hear of it; but those that promise themselvessecrecy in sin, are generally disappointed. The age and death of Isaacare recorded, though he died not till after Joseph was sold into Egypt.Isaac lived about forty years after he had made his will, chap. 27:2.We shall not die an hour the sooner, but much the better, for timelysetting our hearts and houses in order. Particular notice is taken ofthe agreement of Esau and Jacob at their father's funeral, to show howGod had wonderfully changed Esau's mind. It is awful to beholdrelations, sometimes for a little of this world's goods, disputing overthe graves of their friends, while they are near going to the gravethemselves.
Gen 37:1-4	<br>In Joseph's history we see something of Christ, who was first humbledand then exalted. It also shows the lot of Christians, who must throughmany tribulations enter into the kingdom. It is a history that has nonelike it, for displaying the various workings of the human mind, bothgood and bad, and the singular providence of God in making use of themfor fulfilling his purposes. Though Joseph was his father's darling,yet he was not bred up in idleness. Those do not truly love theirchildren, who do not use them to business, and labour, and hardships.The fondling of children is with good reason called the spoiling ofthem. Those who are trained up to do nothing, are likely to be good fornothing. But Jacob made known his love, by dressing Joseph finer thanthe rest of his children. It is wrong for parents to make a differencebetween one child and another, unless there is great cause for it, bythe children's dutifulness, or undutifulness. When parents make adifference, children soon notice it, and it leads to quarrels infamilies. Jacob's sons did that, when they were from under his eye,which they durst not have done at home with him; but Joseph gave hisfather an account of their ill conduct, that he might restrain them.Not as a tale-bearer, to sow discord, but as a faithful brother.
Gen 37:5-11	<br>God gave Joseph betimes the prospect of his advancement, to support andcomfort him under his long and grievous troubles. Observe, Josephdreamed of his preferment, but he did not dream of his imprisonment.Thus many young people, when setting out in the world, think of nothingbut prosperity and pleasure, and never dream of trouble. His brethrenrightly interpreted the dream, though they abhorred the interpretationof it. While they committed crimes in order to defeat it, they werethemselves the instruments of accomplishing it. Thus the Jewsunderstood what Christ said of his kingdom. Determined that he shouldnot reign over them, they consulted to put him to death; and by hiscrucifixion, made way for the exaltation they designed to prevent.
Gen 37:12-22	<br>How readily does Joseph wait his father's orders! Those children whoare best beloved by their parents, should be the most ready to obeythem. See how deliberate Joseph's brethren were against him. Theythought to slay him from malice aforethought, and in cold blood.Whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer, 1Jo 3:15. The sons of Jacobhated their brother because their father loved him. New occasions, ashis dreams and the like, drew them on further; but this laid ranklingin their hearts, till they resolved on his death. God has all hearts inhis hands. Reuben had most reason to be jealous of Joseph, for he wasthe first-born; yet he proves his best friend. God overruled all toserve his own purpose, of making Joseph an instrument to save muchpeople alive. Joseph was a type of Christ; for though he was thebeloved Son of his Father, and hated by a wicked world, yet the Fathersent him out of his bosom to visit us in great humility and love. Hecame from heaven to earth to seek and save us; yet then malicious plotswere laid against him. His own not only received him not, but crucifiedhim. This he submitted to, as a part of his design to redeem and saveus.
Gen 37:23-30	<br>They threw Joseph into a pit, to perish there with hunger and cold; socruel were their tender mercies. They slighted him when he was indistress, and were not grieved for the affliction of Joseph, see Am6:6; for when he was pining in the pit, they sat down to eat bread.They felt no remorse of conscience for the sin. But the wrath of manshall praise God, and the remainder of wrath he will restrain, Ps76:10. Joseph's brethren were wonderfully restrained from murderinghim, and their selling him as wonderfully turned to God's praise.
Gen 37:31-36	<br>When Satan has taught men to commit one sin, he teaches them to try toconceal it with another; to hide theft and murder, with lying and falseoaths: but he that covers his sin shall not prosper long. Joseph'sbrethren kept their own and one another's counsel for some time; buttheir villany came to light at last, and it is here published to theworld. To grieve their father, they sent him Joseph's coat of colours;and he hastily thought, on seeing the bloody coat, that Joseph was rentin pieces. Let those that know the heart of a parent, suppose the agonyof poor Jacob. His sons basely pretended to comfort him, but miserable,hypocritical comforters were they all. Had they really desired tocomfort him, they might at once have done it, by telling the truth. Theheart is strangely hardened by the deceitfulness of sin. Jacob refusedto be comforted. Great affection to any creature prepares for so muchthe greater affliction, when it is taken from us, or made bitter to us:undue love commonly ends in undue grief. It is the wisdom of parentsnot to bring up children delicately, they know not to what hardshipsthey may be brought before they die. From the whole of this chapter wesee with wonder the ways of Providence. The malignant brothers seem tohave gotten their ends; the merchants, who care not what they deal inso that they gain, have also obtained theirs; and Potiphar, having gota fine young slave, has obtained his! But God's designs are, by thesemeans, in train for execution. This event shall end in Israel's goingdown to Egypt; that ends in their deliverance by Moses; that in settingup the true religion in the world; and that in the spread of it amongall nations by the gospel. Thus the wrath of man shall praise the Lord,and the remainder thereof will he restrain.
Gen 39:1-6	<br>Our enemies may strip us of outward distinctions and ornaments; butwisdom and grace cannot be taken from us. They may separate us fromfriends, relatives, and country; but they cannot take from us thepresence of the Lord. They may shut us from outward blessings, rob usof liberty, and confine us in dungeons; but they cannot shut us outfrom communion with God, from the throne of grace, or take from us theblessings of salvation. Joseph was blessed, wonderfully blessed, evenin the house where he was a slave. God's presence with us, makes all wedo prosperous. Good men are the blessings of the place where they live;good servants may be so, though mean and lightly esteemed. Theprosperity of the wicked is, one way or other, for the sake of thegodly. Here was a wicked family blessed for the sake of one goodservant in it.
Gen 39:7-12	<br>Beauty either in men or women, often proves a snare both to themselvesand others. This forbids pride in it, and requires constantwatchfulness against the temptation that attends it. We have great needto make a covenant with our eyes, lest the eyes infect the heart. Whenlust has got power, decency, and reputation, and conscience, are allsacrificed. Potiphar's wife showed that her heart was fully set to doevil. Satan, when he found he could not overcome Joseph with thetroubles and the frowns of the world, for in them he still held fasthis principle, assaulted him with pleasures, which have ruined morethan the former. But Joseph, by the grace of God, was enabled to resistand overcome this temptation; and his escape was as great an instanceof the Divine power, as the deliverance of the three children out ofthe fiery furnace. This sin was one which might most easily beset him.The tempter was his mistress, one whose favour would help him forward;and it was at his utmost peril if he slighted her, and made her hisenemy. The time and place favoured the temptation. To all this wasadded frequent, constant urging. The almighty grace of God enabledJoseph to overcome this assault of the enemy. He urges what he owedboth to God and his master. We are bound in honour, as well as justiceand gratitude, not in any thing to wrong those who place trust in us,how secretly soever it may be done. He would not offend his God. Threearguments Joseph urges upon himself. 1. He considers who he was thatwas tempted. One in covenant with God, who professed religion andrelation to him. 2. What the sin was to which he was tempted. Othersmight look upon it as a small matter; but Joseph did not so think ofit. Call sin by its own name, and never lessen it. Let sins of thisnature always be looked upon as great wickedness, as exceedinglysinful. 3. Against whom he was tempted to sin, against God. Sin isagainst God, against his nature and his dominion, against his love andhis design. Those that love God, for this reason hate sin. The grace ofGod enabled Joseph to overcome the temptation, by avoiding the temper.He would not stay to parley with the temptation, but fled from it, asescaping for his life. If we mean not to do iniquity, let us flee as abird from the snare, and as a roe from the hunter.
Gen 39:13-18	<br>Joseph's mistress, having tried in vain to make him a guilty man,endeavoured to be avenged on him. Those that have broken the bonds ofmodesty, will never be held by the bonds of truth. It is no new thingfor the best of men to be falsely accused of the worst of crimes, bythose who themselves are the worst of criminals. It is well there is aday of discovery coming, in which all shall appear in their truecharacters.
Gen 39:19-23	<br>Joseph's master believed the accusation. Potiphar, it is likely, chosethat prison, because it was the worst; but God designed to open the wayto Joseph's honour. Joseph was owned and righted by his God. He wasaway from all his friends and relations; he had none to help or comforthim; but the Lord was with Joseph, and showed him mercy. Those thathave a good conscience in a prison, have a good God there. God gave himfavour in the sight of the keeper of the prison; he trusted him tomanage the affairs of the prison. A good man will do good wherever heis, and will be a blessing even in bonds and banishment. Let us notforget, through Joseph, to look unto Jesus, who suffered being tempted,yet without sin; who was slandered, and persecuted, and imprisoned, butwithout cause; who by the cross ascended to the throne. May we beenabled to follow the same path in submitting and in suffering, to thesame place of glory.
Gen 40:1-19	<br>It was not so much the prison that made the butler and baker sad, astheir dreams. God has more ways than one to sadden the spirits. Josephhad compassion towards them. Let us be concerned for the sadness of ourbrethren's countenances. It is often a relief to those that are introuble to be noticed. Also learn to look into the causes of our ownsorrow. Is there a good reason? Is there not comfort sufficient tobalance it, whatever it is? Why art thou cast down, O my soul? Josephwas careful to ascribe the glory to God. The chief butler's dreamforetold his advancement. The chief baker's dream his death. It was notJoseph's fault that he brought the baker no better tidings. And thusministers are but interpreters; they cannot make the thing otherwisethan it is: if they deal faithfully, and their message proveunpleasing, it is not their fault. Joseph does not reflect upon hisbrethren that sold him; nor does he reflect on the wrong done him byhis mistress and his master, but mildly states his own innocence. Whenwe are called on to clear ourselves, we should carefully avoid, as muchas may be, speaking ill of others. Let us be content to prove ourselvesinnocent, and not upbraid others with their guilt.
Gen 40:20-23	<br>Joseph's interpretation of the dreams came to pass on the very dayfixed. On Pharaoh's birth-day, all his servants attended him, and thenthe cases of these two came to be looked into. We may all profitablytake notice of our birth-days, with thankfulness for the mercies of ourbirth, sorrow for the sinfulness of our lives, and expectation of theday of our death, as better than the day of our birth. But it seemsstrange that worldly people, who are so fond of living here, shouldrejoice at the end of one year after another of their short span oflife. A Christian has cause to rejoice that he was born, also that hecomes nearer to the end of his sin and sorrow, and nearer to hiseverlasting happiness. The chief butler remembered not Joseph, butforgot him. Joseph had deserved well at his hands, yet he forgot him.We must not think it strange, if in this world we have hatred shown usfor our love, and slights for our kindness. See how apt those who arethemselves at ease are to forget others in distress. Joseph learned byhis disappointment to trust in God only. We cannot expect too littlefrom man, nor too much from God. Let us not forget the sufferings,promises, and love of our Redeemer. We blame the chief butler'singratitude to Joseph, yet we ourselves act much more ungratefully tothe Lord Jesus. Joseph had but foretold the chief butler's enlargement,but Christ wrought out ours; he mediated with the King of Kings for us;yet we forget him, though often reminded of him, and though we havepromised never to forget him. Thus ill do we requite Him, like foolishpeople and unwise.
Gen 41:1-8	<br>The means of Joseph's being freed from prison were Pharaoh's dreams, ashere related. Now that God no longer speaks to us in that way, it is nomatter how little we either heed dreams, or tell them. The telling offoolish dreams can make no better than foolish talk. But these dreamsshowed that they were sent of God; when he awoke, Pharaoh's spirit wastroubled.
Gen 41:9-32	<br>God's time for the enlargement of his people is the fittest time. Ifthe chief butler had got Joseph to be released from prison, it isprobable he would have gone back to the land of the Hebrews. Then hehad neither been so blessed himself, nor such a blessing to his family,as afterwards he proved. Joseph, when introduced to Pharaoh, giveshonour to God. Pharaoh had dreamed that he stood upon the bank of theriver Nile, and saw the kine, both the fat ones, and the lean ones,come out of the river. Egypt has no rain, but the plenty of the yeardepends upon the overflowing of the river Nile. See how many waysProvidence has of dispensing its gifts; yet our dependence is still thesame upon the First Cause, who makes every creature what it is to us,be it rain or river. See to what changes the comforts of this life aresubject. We cannot be sure that to-morrow shall be as this day, or nextyear as this. We must learn how to want, as well as how to abound. Markthe goodness of God in sending the seven years of plenty before thoseof famine, that provision might be made. The produce of the earth issometimes more, and sometimes less; yet, take one with another, he thatgathers much, has nothing over; and he that gathers little, has nolack, Ex 16:18. And see the perishing nature of our worldly enjoyments.The great harvests of the years of plenty were quite lost, andswallowed up in the years of famine; and that which seemed very much,yet did but just serve to keep the people alive. There is bread whichlasts to eternal life, which it is worth while to labour for. They thatmake the things of this world their good things, will find littlepleasure in remembering that they have received them.
Gen 41:33-45	<br>Joseph gave good advice to Pharaoh. Fair warning should always befollowed by good counsel. God has in his word told us of a day of trialbefore us, when we shall need all the grace we can have. Now,therefore, provide accordingly. Pharaoh gave Joseph an honourabletestimony. He is a man in whom the spirit of God is; and such men oughtto be valued. Pharaoh puts upon Joseph marks of honour. He gave himsuch a name as spoke the value he had for him, Zaphnath-paaneah, "arevealer of secrets." This preferment of Joseph encourages all to trustin God. Some translate Joseph's new name, "the saviour of the world."The brightest glories, even of the upper world, are put upon Christ,the highest trust lodged in his hand, and all power given him, both inheaven and earth.
Gen 41:46-57	<br>In the names of his two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim, Joseph owned theDivine providence. 1. He was made to forget his misery. 2. He was madefruitful in the land of his affliction. The seven plenteous years came,and were ended. We ought to look forward to the end of the days, bothof our prosperity and of our opportunity. We must not be secure inprosperity, nor slothful in making good use of opportunity. Years ofplenty will end; what thy hand finds to do, do it; and gather ingathering time. The dearth came, and the famine was not only in Egypt,but in other lands. Joseph was diligent in laying up, while the plentylasted. He was prudent and careful in giving out, when the famine came.Joseph was engaged in useful and important labours. Yet it was in themidst of this his activity that his father Jacob said, Joseph is not!What a large portion of our troubles would be done away if we knew thewhole truth! Let these events lead us to Jesus. There is a famine ofthe bread of life throughout the whole earth. Go to Jesus, and what hebids you, do. Attend to His voice, apply to him; he will open histreasures, and satisfy with goodness the hungry soul of every age andnation, without money and without price. But those who slight thisprovision must starve, and his enemies will be destroyed.
Gen 42:1-6	<br>Jacob saw the corn his neighbours had bought in Egypt, and broughthome. It is a spur to exertion to see others supplied. Shall others getfood for their souls, and shall we starve while it is to be had? Havingdiscovered where help is to be had, we should apply for it withoutdelay, without shrinking from labour, or grudging expense, especiallyas regards our never-dying souls. There is provision in Christ; but wemust come to him, and seek it from him.
Gen 42:7-20	<br>Joseph was hard upon his brethren, not from a spirit of revenge, but tobring them to repentance. Not seeing his brother Benjamin, he suspectedthat they had made away with him, and he gave them occasion to speak oftheir father and brother. God, in his providence, sometimes seems harshwith those he loves, and speaks roughly to those for whom yet he hasgreat mercy in store. Joseph settled at last, that one of them shouldbe left, and the rest go home and fetch Benjamin. It was a veryencouraging word he said to them, "I fear God;" as if he had said, Youmay be assured I will do you no wrong; I dare not, for I know there isone higher than I. With those that fear God, we may expect fairdealing.
Gen 42:21-24	<br>The office of conscience is to bring to mind things long since said anddone. When the guilt of this sin of Joseph's brethren was fresh, theymade light of it, and sat down to eat bread; but now, long afterward,their consciences accused them of it. See the good of afflictions; theyoften prove the happy means of awakening conscience, and bringing sinto our remembrance. Also, the evil of guilt as to our brethren.Conscience now reproached them for it. Whenever we think we have wrongdone us, we ought to remember the wrong we have done to others. Reubenalone remembered with comfort, that he had done what he could toprevent the mischief. When we share with others in their sufferings, itwill be a comfort if we have the testimony of our consciences for us,that we did not share in their evil deeds, but in our places witnessedagainst them. Joseph retired to weep. Though his reason directed thathe should still carry himself as a stranger, because they were not asyet humbled enough, yet natural affection could not but work.
Gen 42:25-28	<br>The brethren came for corn, and corn they had: not only so, but everyman had his money given back. Thus Christ, like Joseph, gives outsupplies without money and without price. The poorest are invited tobuy. But guilty consciences are apt to take good providences in a badsense; to put wrong meanings even upon things that make for them.
Gen 42:29-38	<br>Here is the report Jacob's sons made to their father. It troubled thegood man. Even the bundles of money Joseph returned, in kindness, tohis father, frightened him. He laid the fault upon his sons; knowingthem, he feared they had provoked the Egyptians, and wrongfully broughthome their money. Jacob plainly distrusted his sons, remembering thathe never saw Joseph since he had been with them. It is bad with afamily, when children behave so ill that their parents know not how totrust them. Jacob gives up Joseph for gone, and Simeon and Benjamin asin danger; and concludes, All these things are against me. It provedotherwise, that all these things were for him, were working togetherfor his good, and the good of his family. We often think that to beagainst us, which is really for us. We are afflicted in body, estate,name, and in our relations; and think all these things are against us,whereas they are really working for us a weight of glory. Thus does theLord Jesus conceal himself and his favour, thus he rebukes and chastensthose for whom he has purposes of love. By sharp corrections andhumbling convictions he will break the stoutness and mar the pride ofthe heart, and bring to true repentance. Yet before sinners fully knowhim, or taste that he is gracious, he consults their good, and sustainstheir souls, to wait for him. May we do thus, never yielding todiscouragement, determining to seek no other refuge, and humblingourselves more and more under his mighty hand. In due time he willanswer our petitions, and do for us more than we can expect.
Gen 43:1-14	<br>Jacob urges his sons to go and buy a little food; now, in time ofdearth, a little must suffice. Judah urges that Benjamin should go withthem. It is not against the honour and duty children owe their parents,humbly to advise them, and when needful, to reason with them. Jacob sawthe necessity of the case, and yielded. His prudence and justiceappeared in three things. 1. He sent back the money they had found inthe sack. Honesty obliges us to restore not only that which comes to usby our own fault, but that which comes to us by the mistakes of others.Though we get it by oversight, if we keep it when the oversight isdiscovered, it is kept by deceit. 2. He sent as much again as they tookthe time before; the price of corn might be risen, or they might haveto pay a ransom for Simeon. 3. He sent a present of such things as theland afforded, and as were scarce in Egypt, balm, and honey, &c.Providence dispenses not its gifts to all alike. But honey and spicewill never make up the want of bread-corn. The famine was sore inCanaan, yet they had balm and myrrh, &c. We may live well enough uponplain food, without dainties; but we cannot live upon dainties withoutplain food. Let us thank God that what is most needful and useful,generally is most cheap and common. Though men value very highly theirgold and silver, and the luxuries which are counted the best fruits ofevery land, yet in a time of famine they willingly barter them forbread. And how little will earthly good things stand us in stead in theday of wrath! How ready should we be to renounce them all, as loss, forthe excellency of the knowledge of Jesus Christ! Our way to prevailwith man is by first prevailing with the Lord in fervent prayer. But,Thy will be done, should close every petition for the mercies of thislife, or against the afflictions of this life.
Gen 43:15-25	<br>Jacob's sons went down the second time into Egypt to buy corn. If weshould ever know what a famine of the word means, let us not think itmuch to travel as far for spiritual food, as they did for bodily food.Joseph's steward had orders from his master to take them to his house.Even this frightened them. Those that are guilty make the worst ofevery thing. But the steward encouraged them. It appears, from what hesaid, that by his good master he was brought to the knowledge of thetrue God, the God of the Hebrews. Religious servants should take allfit occasions to speak of God and his providence, with reverence andseriousness.
Gen 43:26-34	<br>Observe the great respect Joseph's brethren paid to him. Thus wereJoseph's dreams more and more fulfilled. Joseph showed great kindnessto them. He treated them nobly; but see here the early distance betweenJews and gentiles. In a day of famine, it is enough to be fed; but theywere feasted. Their cares and fears were now over, and they ate theirbread with joy, reckoning they were upon good terms with the lord ofthe land. If God accept our works, our present, we have reason to becheerful. Joseph showed special regard for Benjamin, that he might trywhether his brethren would envy him. It must be our rule, to be contentwith what we have, and not to grieve at what others have. Thus Jesusshows those whom he loves, more and more of their need. He makes themsee that he is their only refuge from destruction. He overcomes theirunwillingness, and brings them to himself. Then, as he sees good, hegives them some taste of his love, and welcomes them to the provisionsof his house, as an earnest of what he further intends for them.
Gen 44:1-17	<br>Joseph tried how his brethren felt towards Benjamin. Had they enviedand hated the other son of Rachel as they had hated him, and if theyhad the same want of feeling towards their father Jacob as heretofore,they would now have shown it. When the cup was found upon Benjamin,they would have a pretext for leaving him to be a slave. But we cannotjudge what men are now, by what they have been formerly; nor what theywill do, by what they have done. The steward charged them with beingungrateful, rewarding evil for good; with folly, in taking away the cupof daily use, which would soon be missed, and diligent search made forit; for so it may be read, Is not this it in which my lord drinketh, ashaving a particular fondness for it, and for which he would searchthoroughly? Or, By which, leaving it carelessly at your table, he wouldmake trial whether you were honest men or not? They throw themselvesupon Joseph's mercy, and acknowledge the righteousness of God, perhapsthinking of the injury they had formerly done to Joseph, for which theythought God was now reckoning with them. Even in afflictions wherein webelieve ourselves wronged by men, we must own that God is righteous,and finds out our sin.
Gen 44:18-34	<br>Had Joseph been, as Judah supposed him, an utter stranger to thefamily, he could not but be wrought upon by his powerful reasonings.But neither Jacob nor Benjamin need an intercessor with Joseph; for hehimself loved them. Judah's faithful cleaving to Benjamin, now, in hisdistress, was recompensed long afterwards by the tribe of Benjaminkeeping with the tribe of Judah, when the other tribes deserted it. Theapostle, when discoursing of the mediation of Christ, observes, thatour Lord sprang out of Judah, Heb 7:14; and he not only madeintercession for the transgressors, but he became a Surety for them,testifying therein tender concern, both for his Father and for hisbrethren. Jesus, the great antitype of Joseph, humbles and proves hispeople, even after they have had some tastes of his loving-kindness. Hebrings their sins to their remembrance, that they may exercise and showrepentance, and feel how much they owe to his mercy.
Gen 45:1-15	<br>Joseph let Judah go on, and heard all he had to say. He found hisbrethren humbled for their sins, mindful of himself, for Judah hadmentioned him twice in his speech, respectful to their father, and verytender of their brother Benjamin. Now they were ripe for the comfort hedesigned, by making himself known. Joseph ordered all his attendants towithdraw. Thus Christ makes himself and his loving-kindness known tohis people, out of the sight and hearing of the world. Joseph shedtears of tenderness and strong affection, and with these threw off thatausterity with which he had hitherto behaved toward his brethren. Thisrepresents the Divine compassion toward returning penitents. "I amJoseph, your brother." This would humble them yet more for their sin inselling him, but would encourage them to hope for kind treatment. Thus,when Christ would convince Paul, he said, I am Jesus; and when he wouldcomfort his disciples, he said, It is I, be not afraid. When Christmanifests himself to his people, he encourages them to draw near to himwith a true heart. Joseph does so, and shows them, that whatever theythought to do against him, God had brought good out of it. Sinners mustgrieve and be angry with themselves for their sins, though God bringsgood out of it, for that is no thanks to them. The agreement betweenall this, and the case of a sinner, on Christ's manifesting himself tohis soul, is very striking. He does not, on this account, think sin aless, but a greater evil; and yet he is so armed against despair, aseven to rejoice in what God hath wrought, while he trembles in thinkingof the dangers and destruction from which he has escaped. Josephpromises to take care of his father and all the family. It is the dutyof children, if the necessity of their parents at any time require it,to support and supply them to the utmost of their ability; this isshowing piety at home, 1Ti 5:4. After Joseph had embraced Benjamin, hecaressed them all, and then his brethren talked with him freely of allthe affairs of their father's house. After the tokens of truereconciliation with the Lord Jesus, sweet communion with him follows.
Gen 45:16-24	<br>Pharaoh was kind to Joseph, and to his relations for his sake. Egyptwould make up the losses of their removal. Thus those for whom Christintends his heavenly glory, ought not to regard the things of thisworld. The best of its enjoyments are but lumber; we cannot make sureof them while here, much less can we carry them away with us. Let usnot set our eyes or hearts upon the world; there are better things forus in that blessed land, whither Christ, our Joseph, is gone to preparea place. Joseph dismissed his brethren with a seasonable caution, "Seethat ye fall not out by the way." He knew they were too apt to bequarrelsome; and having forgiven them all, he lays this charge uponthem, not to upbraid one another. This command our Lord Jesus has givento us, that we love one another, and that whatever happens, or hashappened, we fall not out. For we are brethren, we have all one Father.We are all guilty, and instead of quarrelling with one another, havereason to fall out with ourselves. We are, or hope to be, forgiven ofGod, whom we have all offended, and, therefore, should be ready toforgive one another. We are "by the way," a way through the land ofEgypt, where we have many eyes upon us, that seek advantage against us;a way that leads to the heavenly Canaan, where we hope to be for everin perfect peace.
Gen 45:25-28	<br>To hear that Joseph is alive, is too good news to be true; Jacobfaints, for he believes it not. We faint, because we do not believe. Atlength, Jacob is convinced of the truth. Jacob was old, and did notexpect to live long. He says, Let my eyes be refreshed with this sightbefore they are closed, and then I need no more to make me happy inthis world. Behold Jesus manifesting himself as a Brother and a Friendto those who once were his despisers, his enemies. He assures them ofhis love and the riches of his grace. He commands them to lay asideenvy, anger, malice, and strife, and to live in peace with each other.He teaches them to give up the world for him and his fulness. Hesupplies all that is needful to bring them home to himself, that wherehe is they may be also. And though, when he at last sends for hispeople, they may for a time feel some doubts and fears, yet the thoughtof seeing his glory and of being with him, will enable them to say, Itis enough, I am willing to die; and I go to see, and to be with theBeloved of my soul.
Gen 46:1-4	<br>Even as to those events and undertakings which appear most joyful, weshould seek counsel, assistance, and a blessing from the Lord.Attending on his ordinances, and receiving the pledges of his covenantlove, we expect his presence, and that peace which it confers. In allremovals we should be reminded of our removal out of this world.Nothing can encourage us to fear no evil when passing through thevalley of the shadow of death, but the presence of Christ.
Gen 46:5-27	<br>We have here a particular account of Jacob's family. Though thefulfilling of promises is always sure, yet it is often slow. It was now215 years since God had promised Abraham to make of him a great nation,ch. 12:2; yet that branch of his seed, to which the promise was madesure, had only increased to seventy, of whom this particular account iskept, to show the power of God in making these seventy become a vastmultitude.
Gen 46:28-34	<br>It was justice to Pharaoh to let him know that such a family was cometo settle in his dominions. If others put confidence in us, we must notbe so base as to abuse it by imposing upon them. But how shall Josephdispose of his brethren? Time was, when they were contriving to be ridof him; now he is contriving to settle them to their advantage; this isrendering good for evil. He would have them live by themselves, in theland of Goshen, which lay nearest to Canaan. Shepherds were anabomination to the Egyptians. Yet Joseph would have them not ashamed toown this as their occupation before Pharaoh. He might have procuredplaces for them at court or in the army. But such preferments wouldhave exposed them to the envy of the Egyptians, and might have temptedthem to forget Canaan and the promise made unto their fathers. Anhonest calling is no disgrace, nor ought we to account it so, butrather reckon it a shame to be idle, or to have nothing to do. It isgenerally best for people to abide in the callings they have been bredto and used to. Whatever employment and condition God in his providencehas allotted for us, let us suit ourselves to it, satisfy ourselveswith it, and not mind high things. It is better to be the credit of amean post, than the shame of a high one. If we wish to destroy oursouls, or the souls of our children, then let us seek for ourselves,and for them, great things; but if not, it becomes us, having food andraiment, therewith to be content.
Gen 47:1-6	<br>Though Joseph was a great man, especially in Egypt, yet he owned hisbrethren. Let the rich and great in the world not overlook or despisepoor relations. Our Lord Jesus is not ashamed to call us brethren. Inanswer to Pharaoh's inquiry, What is your calling? they told him thatthey were shepherds, adding that they were come to sojourn in the landfor a time, while the famine prevailed in Canaan. Pharaoh offered toemploy them as shepherds, provided they were active men. Whatever ourbusiness or employment is, we should aim to excel in it, and to proveourselves clever and industrious.
Gen 47:7-12	<br>With the gravity of old age, the piety of a true believer, and theauthority of a patriarch and a prophet, Jacob besought the Lord tobestow a blessing upon Pharaoh. He acted as a man not ashamed of hisreligion; and who would express gratitude to the benefactor of himselfand his family. We have here a very uncommon answer given to a verycommon question. Jacob calls his life a pilgrimage; the sojourning of astranger in a foreign country, or his journey home to his own country.He was not at home upon earth; his habitation, his inheritance, histreasures were in heaven. He reckons his life by days; even by dayslife is soon reckoned, and we are not sure of the continuance of it fora day. Let us therefore number our days. His days were few. Though hehad now lived one hundred and thirty years, they seemed but a few days,in comparison with the days of eternity, and the eternal state. Theywere evil; this is true concerning man. He is of few days and full oftrouble; since his days are evil, it is well they are few. Jacob's lifehad been made up of evil days. Old age came sooner upon him than it haddone upon some of his fathers. As the young man should not be proud ofhis strength or beauty, so the old man should not be proud of his age,and his hoary hairs, though others justly reverence them; for those whoare accounted very old, attain not to the years of the patriarchs. Thehoary head is only a crown of glory, when found in the way ofrighteousness. Such an answer could not fail to impress the heart ofPharaoh, by reminding him that worldly prosperity and happiness couldnot last long, and was not enough to satisfy. After a life of vanityand vexation, man goes down into the grave, equally from the throne asthe cottage. Nothing can make us happy, but the prospect of aneverlasting home in heaven, after our short and weary pilgrimage onearth.
Gen 47:13-26	<br>Care being taken of Jacob and his family, which mercy was especiallydesigned by Providence in Joseph's advancement, an account is given ofthe saving the kingdom of Egypt from ruin. There was no bread, and thepeople were ready to die. See how we depend upon God's providence. Allour wealth would not keep us from starving, if rain were withheld fortwo or three years. See how much we are at God's mercy, and let us keepourselves always in his love. Also see how much we smart by our ownwant of care. If all the Egyptians had laid up corn for themselves inthe seven years of plenty, they had not been in these straits; but theyregarded not the warning. Silver and gold would not feed them: theymust have corn. All that a man hath will he give for his life. Wecannot judge this matter by modern rules. It is plain that theEgyptians regarded Joseph as a public benefactor. The whole isconsistent with Joseph's character, acting between Pharaoh and hissubjects, in the fear of God. The Egyptians confessed concerningJoseph, Thou hast saved our lives. What multitudes will gratefully sayto Jesus, at the last day, Thou hast saved our souls from the mosttremendous destruction, and in the season of uttermost distress! TheEgyptians parted with all their property, and even their liberty, forthe saving of their lives: can it then be too much for us to count allbut loss, and part with all, at His command, and for His sake, who willboth save our souls, and give us an hundredfold, even here, in thispresent world? Surely if saved by Christ, we shall be willing to becomehis servants.
Gen 47:27-31	<br>At last the time drew nigh that Israel must die. Israel, a prince withGod, had power over the Angel, and prevailed, yet must die. Josephsupplied him with bread, that he might not die by famine, but that didnot secure him from dying by age or sickness. He died by degrees; hiscandle gradually burnt down to the socket, so that he saw the timedrawing nigh. It is an advantage to see the approach of death, beforewe feel it, that we may be quickened to do, with all our might, whatour hands find to do. However, death is not far from any of us. Jacob'scare, as he saw the day approach, was about his burial; not the pomp ofit, but he would be buried in Canaan, because it was the land ofpromise. It was a type of heaven, that better country, which hedeclared plainly he expected, Heb 11:14. Nothing will better help tomake a death-bed easy, than the certain prospect of rest in theheavenly Canaan after death. When this was done, Israel bowed himselfupon the bed's head, worshipping God, as it is explained, see Heb11:21, giving God thanks for all his favours; in feebleness thussupporting himself, expressing his willingness to leave the world. Eventhose who lived on Joseph's provision, and Jacob who was so dear tohim, must die. But Christ Jesus gives us the true bread, that we mayeat and live for ever. To Him let us come and yield ourselves, and whenwe draw near to death, he who supported us through life, will meet usand assure us of everlasting salvation.
Gen 48:1-7	<br>The death-beds of believers, with the prayers and counsels of dyingpersons, are suited to make serious impressions upon the young, thegay, and the prosperous: we shall do well to take children on suchoccasions, when it can be done properly. If the Lord please, it is verydesirable to bear our dying testimony to his truth, to hisfaithfulness, and the pleasantness of his ways. And one would wish soto live, as to give energy and weight to our dying exhortations. Alltrue believers are blessed at their death, but all do not departequally full of spiritual consolations. Jacob adopted Joseph's twosons. Let them not succeed their father, in his power and grandeur inEgypt; but let them succeed in the inheritance of the promise made toAbraham. Thus the aged dying patriarch teaches these young persons totake their lot with the people of God. He appoints each of them to bethe head of a tribe. Those are worthy of double honour, who, throughGod's grace, break through the temptations of worldly wealth andpreferment, to embrace religion in disgrace and poverty. Jacob willhave Ephraim and Manasseh to know, that it is better to be low, and inthe church, than high, and out of it.
Gen 48:8-22	<br>The two good men own God in their comforts. Joseph says, They are mysons whom God has given me. Jacob says, God hath showed me thy seed.Comforts are doubly sweet to us when we see them coming from God'shand. He not only prevents our fears, but exceeds our hopes. Jacobmentions the care the Divine providence had taken of him all his days.A great deal of hardship he had known in his time, but God kept himfrom the evil of his troubles. Now he was dying, he looked upon himselfas redeemed from all sin and sorrow for ever. Christ, the Angel of thecovenant, redeems from all evil. Deliverances from misery and dangers,by the Divine power, coming through the ransom of the blood of Christ,in Scripture are often called redemption. In blessing Joseph's sons,Jacob crossed hands. Joseph was willing to support his first-born, andwould have removed his father's hands. But Jacob acted neither bymistake, nor from a partial affection to one more than the other; butfrom a spirit of prophecy, and by the Divine counsel. God, in bestowingblessings upon his people, gives more to some than to others, moregifts, graces, and comforts, and more of the good things of this life.He often gives most to those that are least likely. He chooses the weakthings of the world; he raises the poor out of the dust. Grace observesnot the order of nature, nor does God prefer those whom we thinkfittest to be preferred, but as it pleases him. How poor are they whohave no riches but those of this world! How miserable is a death-bed tothose who have no well-grounded hope of good, but dreadfulapprehensions of evil, and nothing but evil for ever!
Gen 49:1,2	<br>All Jacob's sons were living. His calling them together was a preceptfor them to unite in love, not to mingle with the Egyptians; andforetold that they should not be separated, as Abraham's sons andIsaac's were, but should all make one people. We are not to considerthis address as the expression of private feelings of affection,resentment, or partiality; but as the language of the Holy Ghost,declaring the purpose of God respecting the character, circumstances,and situation of the tribes which descended from the sons of Jacob, andwhich may be traced in their histories.
Gen 49:3-7	<br>Reuben was the first-born; but by gross sin, he forfeited thebirthright. The character of Reuben is, that he was unstable as water.Men do not thrive, because they do not fix. Reuben's sin left a lastinginfamy upon his family. Let us never do evil, then we need not fearbeing told of it. Simeon and Levi were passionate and revengeful. Themurder of the Shechemites is a proof of this. Jacob protested againstthat barbarous act. Our soul is our honour; by its powers we aredistinguished from, and raised above, the beasts that perish. We ought,from our hearts, to abhor all bloody and mischievous men. Cursed betheir anger. Jacob does not curse their persons, but their lusts. Iwill divide them. The sentence as it respects Levi was turned into ablessing. This tribe performed an acceptable service in their zealagainst the worshippers of the golden calf, Ex 32. Being set apart toGod as priests, they were in that character scattered through thenation of Israel.
Gen 49:8-12	<br>Judah's name signifies praise. God was praised for him, chap. 29:35,praised by him, and praised in him; therefore his brethren shall praisehim. Judah should be a strong and courageous tribe. Judah is compared,not to a lion raging and ranging, but to a lion enjoying thesatisfaction of his power and success, without creating vexation toothers; this is to be truly great. Judah should be the royal tribe, thetribe from which Messiah the Prince should come. Shiloh, that promisedSeed in whom the earth should be blessed, "that peaceable andprosperous One," or "Saviour," he shall come of Judah. Thus dying Jacobat a great distance saw Christ's day, and it was his comfort andsupport on his death-bed. Till Christ's coming, Judah possessedauthority, but after his crucifixion this was shortened, and accordingto what Christ foretold, Jerusalem was destroyed, and all the poorharassed remnant of Jews were confounded together. Much which is heresaid concerning Judah, is to be applied to our Lord Jesus. In him thereis plenty of all which is nourishing and refreshing to the soul, andwhich maintains and cheers the Divine life in it. He is the true Vine;wine is the appointed symbol of his blood, which is drink indeed, asshed for sinners, and applied in faith; and all the blessings of hisgospel are wine and milk, without money and without price, to whichevery thirsty soul is welcome. Isa 55:1.
Gen 49:13-18	<br>Concerning Zebulun: if prophecy says, Zebulun shall be a haven ofships, be sure Providence will so plant him. God appoints the bounds ofour habitation. It is our wisdom and duty to accommodate ourselves toour lot, and to improve it; if Zebulun dwell at the heaven of the sea,let him be for a haven of ships. Concerning Issachar: he saw that theland was pleasant, yielding not only pleasant prospects, but pleasantfruits to recompense his toils. Let us, with an eye of faith, see theheavenly rest to be good, and that land of promise to be pleasant; thiswill make our present services easy. Dan should, by art, and policy,and surprise, gain advantages against his enemies, like a serpentbiting the heel of the traveller. Jacob, almost spent, and ready tofaint, relieves himself with those words, "I have waited for thysalvation, O Lord!" The salvation he waited for was Christ, thepromised Seed; now that he was going to be gathered to his people, hebreathes after Him to whom the gathering of the people shall be. Hedeclared plainly that he sought heaven, the better country, Heb 11:13,14. Now he is going to enjoy the salvation, he comforts himself that hehad waited for the salvation. Christ, as our way to heaven, is to bewaited on; and heaven, as our rest in Christ, is to be waited for. Itis the comfort of a dying saint thus to have waited for the salvationof the Lord; for then he shall have what he has been waiting for.
Gen 49:19-21	<br>Concerning Gad, Jacob alludes to his name, which signifies a troop, andforesees the character of that tribe. The cause of God and his people,though for a time it may seem to be baffled and run down, will bevictorious at last. It represents the Christian's conflict. Grace inthe soul is often foiled in its conflicts; troops of corruptionovercome it, but the cause is God's, and grace will in the end come offconqueror, yea, more than conqueror, Ro 8:37. Asher should be a richtribe. His inheritance bordered upon Carmel, which was fruitful to aproverb. Naphtali, is a hind let loose. We may consider it as adescription of the character of this tribe. Unlike the laborious ox andass; desirous of ease and liberty; active, but more noted for quickdespatch than steady labour and perseverance. Like the suppliant who,with goodly words, craves mercy. Let not those of different tempers andgifts censure or envy one another.
Gen 49:22-27	<br>The blessing of Joseph is very full. What Jacob says of him, is historyas well as prophecy. Jacob reminds him of the difficulties and fierydarts of temptations he had formerly struggled through. His faith didnot fail, but through his trials he bore all his burdens with firmness,and did not do anything unbecoming. All our strength for resistingtemptations, and bearing afflictions, comes from God; his grace issufficient. Joseph became the shepherd of Israel, to take care of hisfather and family; also the stone of Israel, their foundation andstrong support. In this, as in many other things, Joseph was aremarkable type of the Good Shepherd, and tried Corner Stone of thewhole church of God. Blessings are promised to Joseph's posterity,typical of the vast and everlasting blessings which come upon thespiritual seed of Christ. Jacob blessed all his sons, but especiallyJoseph, "who was separated from his brethren." Not only separated inEgypt, but, possessing eminent dignity, and more devoted to God. OfBenjamin it is said, He shall ravin as a wolf. Jacob was guided in whathe said by the Spirit of prophecy, and not by natural affection; elsehe would have spoken with more tenderness of his beloved son Benjamin.Concerning him he only foresees and foretells, that his posterityshould be a warlike tribe, strong and daring, and that they shouldenrich themselves with the spoils of their enemies; that they should beactive. Blessed Paul was of this tribe, Ro 11:1; Php 3:5; he, in themorning of his day, devoured the prey as a persecutor, but in theevening divided the spoils as a preacher; he shared the blessings ofJudah's Lion, and assisted in his victories.
Gen 49:28-33	<br>Jacob blessed every one according to the blessings God in after-timesintended to bestow upon them. He spoke about his burial-place, from aprinciple of faith in the promise of God, that Canaan should be theinheritance of his seed in due time. When he had finished both hisblessing and his charge, and so had finished his testimony, headdressed himself to his dying work. He gathered up his feet into thebed, not only as one patiently submitting to the stroke, but as onecheerfully composing himself to rest, now that he was weary. He freelygave up his spirit into the hand of God, the Father of spirits. IfGod's people be our people, death will gather us to them. Under thecare of the Shepherd of Israel, we shall lack nothing for body or soul.We shall remain unmoved until our work is finished; then, breathing outour souls into His hands for whose salvation we have waited, we shalldepart in peace, and leave a blessing for our children after us.
Gen 50:1-6	<br>Though pious relatives and friends have lived to a good old age, and weare confident they are gone to glory, yet we may regret our own loss,and pay respect to their memory by lamenting them. Grace does notdestroy, but it purifies, moderates, and regulates natural affection.The departed soul is out of the reach of any tokens of our affection;but it is proper to show respect to the body, of which we look for aglorious and joyful resurrection, whatever may become of its remains inthis world. Thus Joseph showed his faith in God, and love to hisfather. He ordered the body to be embalmed, or wrapped up with spices,to preserve it. See how vile our bodies are, when the soul has forsakenthem; they will in a very little time become noisome, and offensive.
Gen 50:7-14	<br>Jacob's body was attended, not only by his own family, but by the greatmen of Egypt. Now that they were better acquainted with the Hebrews,they began to respect them. Professors of religion should endeavour bywisdom and love to remove the prejudices many have against them.Standers-by took notice of it as a grievous mourning. The death of goodmen is a loss to any place, and ought to be greatly lamented.
Gen 50:15-21	<br>Various motives might cause the sons of Jacob to continue in Egypt,notwithstanding the prophetic vision Abraham had of their bondagethere. Judging of Joseph from the general temper of human nature, theythought he would now avenge himself on those who hated and injured himwithout cause. Not being able to resist, or to flee away, theyattempted to soften him by humbling themselves. They pleaded with himas the servants of Jacob's God. Joseph was much affected at seeing thiscomplete fulfilment of his dreams. He directs them not to fear him, butto fear God; to humble themselves before the Lord, and to seek theDivine forgiveness. He assures them of his own kindness to them. Seewhat an excellent spirit Joseph was of, and learn of him to render goodfor evil. He comforted them, and, to banish all their fears, he spakekindly to them. Broken spirits must be bound up and encouraged. Thosewe love and forgive, we must not only do well for, but speak kindly to.
Gen 50:22-26	<br>Joseph having honoured his father, his days were long in the land,which, for the present, God had given him. When he saw his deathapproaching, he comforted his brethren with the assurance of theirreturn to Canaan in due time. We must comfort others with the samecomforts with which we have been comforted of God, and encourage themto rest on the promises which are our support. For a confession of hisown faith, and a confirmation of theirs, he charges them to keep hisremains unburied till that glorious day, when they should be settled inthe land of promise. Thus Joseph, by faith in the doctrine of theresurrection, and the promise of Canaan, gave commandment concerninghis bones. This would keep up their expectation of a speedy departurefrom Egypt, and keep Canaan continually in their minds. This would alsoattach Joseph's posterity to their brethren. The death, as well as thelife of this eminent saint, was truly excellent; both furnish us withstrong encouragement to persevere in the service of God. How happy toset our early in the heavenly race, to continue stedfastly, and tofinish the course with joy! This Joseph did, this we also may do. Evenwhen the pains of death are upon us, if we have trusted in Him uponwhom the patriarchs, prophets, and apostles depended, we need not fearto say, "My flesh and my heart faileth, but God is the strength of myheart, and my portion for ever."
Exo 1:1-7	<br>During more than 200 years, while Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob lived atliberty, the Hebrews increased slowly; only about seventy persons wentdown into Egypt. There, in about the same number of years, though undercruel bondage, they became a large nation. This wonderful increase wasaccording to the promise long before made unto the fathers. Though theperformance of God's promises is sometimes slow, it is always sure.
Exo 1:8-14	<br>The land of Egypt became to Israel a house of bondage. The place wherewe have been happy, may soon become the place of our affliction; andthat may prove the greatest cross to us, of which we said, This sameshall comfort us. Cease from man, and say not of any place on this sideheaven, This is my rest. All that knew Joseph, loved him, and were kindto his brethren for his sake; but the best and most useful services aman does to others, are soon forgotten after his death. Our great careshould be, to serve God, and to please him who is not unrighteous,whatever men are, to forget our work and labour of love. The offence ofIsrael is, that he prospers. There is no sight more hateful to a wickedman than the prosperity of the righteous. The Egyptians feared lest thechildren of Israel should join their enemies, and get them up out ofthe land. Wickedness is ever cowardly and unjust; it makes a man fear,where no fear is, and flee, when no one pursues him. And human wisdomoften is foolishness, and very sinful. God's people had task-mastersset over them, not only to burden them, but to afflict them with theirburdens. They not only made them serve for Pharaoh's profit, but sothat their lives became bitter. The Israelites wonderfully increased.Christianity spread most when it was persecuted: the blood of themartyrs was the seed of the church. They that take counsel against theLord and his Israel, do but imagine a vain thing, and create greatervexation to themselves.
Exo 1:15-22	<br>The Egyptians tried to destroy Israel by the murder of their children.The enmity that is in the seed of the serpent, against the Seed of thewoman, makes men forget all pity. It is plain that the Hebrews were nowunder an uncommon blessing. And we see that the services done for God'sIsrael are often repaid in kind. Pharaoh gave orders to drown all themale children of the Hebrews. The enemy who, by Pharaoh, attempted todestroy the church in this its infant state, is busy to stifle the riseof serious reflections in the heart of man. Let those who would escape,be afraid of sinning, and cry directly and fervently to the Lord forassistance.
Exo 2:1-4	<br>Observe the order of Providence: just at the time when Pharaoh'scruelty rose to its height by ordering the Hebrew children to bedrowned, the deliverer was born. When men are contriving the ruin ofthe church, God is preparing for its salvation. The parents of Mosessaw he was a goodly child. A lively faith can take encouragement fromthe least hint of the Divine favour. It is said, Heb 11:23, that theparents of Moses hid him by faith; they had the promise that Israelshould be preserved, which they relied upon. Faith in God's promisequickens to the use of lawful means for obtaining mercy. Duty is ours,events are God's. Faith in God will set us above the fear of man. Atthree months' end, when they could not hide the infant any longer, theyput him in an ark of bulrushes by the river's brink, and set his sisterto watch. And if the weak affection of a mother were thus careful, whatshall we think of Him, whose love, whose compassion is, as himself,boundless. Moses never had a stronger protection about him, no, notwhen all the Israelites were round his tent in the wilderness, thannow, when he lay alone, a helpless babe upon the waves. No water, noEgyptian can hurt him. When we seem most neglected and forlorn, God ismost present with us.
Exo 2:5-10	<br>Come, see the place where that great man, Moses, lay, when he was alittle child; it was in a bulrush basket by the river's side. Had hebeen left there long, he must have perished. But Providence bringsPharaoh's daughter to the place where this poor forlorn infant lay, andinclines her heart to pity it, which she dares do, when none elsedurst. God's care of us in our infancy ought to be often mentioned byus to his praise. Pharaoh cruelly sought to destroy Israel, but his owndaughter had pity on a Hebrew child, and not only so, but, withoutknowing it, preserved Israel's deliverer, and provided Moses with agood nurse, even his own mother. That he should have a Hebrew nurse,the sister of Moses brought the mother into the place of a nurse. Moseswas treated as the son of Pharoah's daughter. Many who, by their birth,are obscure and poor, by surprising events of Providence, are raisedhigh in the world, to make men know that God rules.
Exo 2:11-15	<br>Moses boldly owned the cause of God's people. It is plain from Heb 11.that this was done in faith, with the full purpose of leaving thehonours, wealth, and pleasures of his rank among the Egyptians. By thegrace of God he was a partaker of faith in Christ, which overcomes theworld. He was willing, not only to risk all, but to suffer for hissake; being assured that Israel were the people of God. By specialwarrant from Heaven, which makes no rule for other cases, Moses slew anEgyptian, and rescued an oppressed Israelites. Also, he tried to end adispute between two Hebrews. The reproof Moses gave, may still be ofuse. May we not apply it to disputants, who, by their fierce debates,divide and weaken the Christian church? They forget that they arebrethren. He that did wrong quarreled with Moses. It is a sign of guiltto be angry at reproof. Men know not what they do, nor what enemiesthey are to themselves, when they resist and despise faithful reproofsand reprovers. Moses might have said, if this be the spirit of theHebrews, I will go to court again, and be the son of Pharaoh'sdaughter. But we must take heed of being set against the ways andpeople of God, by the follies and peevishness of some persons thatprofess religion. Moses was obliged to flee into the land of Midian.God ordered this for wise and holy ends.
Exo 2:16-22	<br>Moses found shelter in Midian. He was ready to help Reuel's daughtersto water their flocks, although bred in learning and at court. Mosesloved to be doing justice, and to act in defence of such as he sawinjured, which every man ought to do, as far as it is in his power. Heloved to be doing good; wherever the providence of God casts us, weshould desire and try to be useful; and when we cannot do the good wewould, we must be ready to do the good we can. Moses commended himselfto the prince of Midian; who married one of his daughters to Moses, bywhom he had a son, called Gershom, "a stranger there," that he mightkeep in remembrance the land in which he had been a stranger.
Exo 2:23-25	<br>The Israelites' bondage in Egypt continued, though the murdering oftheir infants did not continue. Sometimes the Lord suffers the rod ofthe wicked to lie very long and very heavy on the lot of the righteous.At last they began to think of God under their troubles. It is a signthat the Lord is coming towards us with deliverance, when he inclinesand enables us to cry to him for it. God heard their groaning; he madeit to appear that he took notice of their complaints. He remembered hiscovenant, of which he is ever mindful. He considered this, and not anymerit of theirs. He looked upon the children of Israel. Moses lookedupon them, and pitied them; but now God looked upon them, and helpedthem. He had respect unto them. His eyes are now fixed upon Israel, toshow himself in their behalf. God is ever thus, a very present help introuble. Take courage then, ye who, conscious of guilt and thraldom,are looking to Him for deliverance. God in Christ Jesus is also lookingupon you. A call of love is joined with a promise of the Redeemer. Comeunto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give yourest, Mt 11:28.
Exo 3:1-6	<br>The years of the life of Moses are divided into three forties; thefirst forty he spent as a prince in Pharaoh's court, the second as ashepherd in Midian, the third as a king in Jeshurun. How changeable isthe life of man! The first appearance of God to Moses, found himtending sheep. This seems a poor employment for a man of his parts andeducation, yet he rests satisfied with it; and thus learns meekness andcontentment, for which he is more noted in sacred writ, than for allhis learning. Satan loves to find us idle; God is pleased when he findsus employed. Being alone, is a good friend to our communion with God.To his great surprise, Moses saw a bush burning without fire to kindleit. The bush burned, and yet did not burn away; an emblem of the churchin bondage in Egypt. And it fitly reminds us of the church in everyage, under its severest persecutions kept by the presence of God frombeing destroyed. Fire is an emblem, in Scripture, of the Divineholiness and justice, also of the afflictions and trials with which Godproves and purifies his people, and even of that baptism of the HolyGhost, by which sinful affections are consumed, and the soul changedinto the Divine nature and image. God gave Moses a gracious call, towhich he returned a ready answer. Those that would have communion withGod, must attend upon him in the ordinances wherein he is pleased tomanifest himself and his glory, though it be in a bush. Putting off theshoe was a token of respect and submission. We ought to draw nigh toGod with a solemn pause and preparation, carefully avoiding every thingthat looks light and rude, and unbecoming his service. God does notsay, I was the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, but I am. Thepatriarchs still live, so many years after their bodies have been inthe grave. No length of time can separate the souls of the just fromtheir Maker. By this, God instructed Moses as to another world, andstrengthened his belief of a future state. Thus it is interpreted byour Lord Jesus, who, from hence, proves that the dead are raised, Lu20:37. Moses hid his face, as if both ashamed and afraid to look uponGod. The more we see of God, and his grace, and covenant love, the morecause we shall see to worship him with reverence and godly fear.
Exo 3:7-10	<br>God notices the afflictions of Israel. Their sorrows; even the secretsorrows of God's people are known to him. Their cry; God hears thecries of his afflicted people. The oppression they endured; the highestand greatest of their oppressors are not above him. God promises speedydeliverance by methods out of the common ways of providence. Those whomGod, by his grace, delivers out of a spiritual Egypt, he will bring toa heavenly Canaan. (Ex 3:11-15)
Exo 3:11-15	<br>Formerly Moses thought himself able to deliver Israel, and set himselfto the work too hastily. Now, when the fittest person on earth for it,he knows his own weakness. This was the effect of more knowledge of Godand of himself. Formerly, self-confidence mingled with strong faith andgreat zeal, now sinful distrust of God crept in under the garb ofhumility; so defective are the strongest graces and the best duties ofthe most eminent saints. But all objections are answered in, CertainlyI will be with thee. That is enough. Two names God would now be knownby. A name that denotes what he is in himself, I AM THAT I AM. Thisexplains his name Jehovah, and signifies, 1. That he is self-existent:he has his being of himself. 2. That he is eternal and unchangeable,and always the same, yesterday, to-day, and for ever. 3. That he isincomprehensible; we cannot by searching find him out: this name checksall bold and curious inquiries concerning God. 4. That he is faithfuland true to all his promises, unchangeable in his word as well as inhis nature; let Israel know this, I AM hath sent me unto you. I am, andthere is none else besides me. All else have their being from God, andare wholly dependent upon him. Also, here is a name that denotes whatGod is to his people. The Lord God of your fathers sent me unto you.Moses must revive among them the religion of their fathers, which wasalmost lost; and then they might expect the speedy performance of thepromises made unto their fathers.
Exo 3:16-22	<br>Moses' success with the elders of Israel would be good. God, who, byhis grace, inclines the heart, and opens the ear, could say beforehand,They shall hearken to thy voice; for he would make them willing in thisday of power. As to Pharaoh, Moses is here told that petitions andpersuasions, and humble complaints, would not prevail with him; nor amighty hand stretched out in signs and wonders. But those willcertainly be broken by the power of God's hand, who will not bow to thepower of his word. Pharaoh's people should furnish Israel with richesat their departure. In Pharaoh's tyranny and Israel's oppression, wesee the miserable, abject state of sinners. However galling the yoke,they drudge on till the Lord sends redemption. With the invitations ofthe gospel, God sends the teaching of his Spirit. Thus are men madewilling to seek and to strive for deliverance. Satan loses his power tohold them, they come forth with all they have and are, and apply all tothe glory of God and the service of his church.
Exo 4:1-9	<br>Moses objects, that the people would not take his word, unless heshowed them some sign. God gives him power to work miracles. But thosewho are now employed to deliver God's messages to men, need not thepower to work miracles: their character and their doctrines are to betried by that word of God to which they appeal. These miraclesespecially referred to the miracles of the Lord Jesus Christ. Itbelonged to Him only, to cast the power of the devil out of the soul,and to heal the soul of the leprosy of sin; and so it was for Him firstto cast the devil out of the body, and to heal the leprosy of the body.
Exo 4:10-17	<br>Moses continued backward to the work God designed him for; there wasmuch of cowardice, slothfulness, and unbelief in him. We must not judgeof men by the readiness of their discourse. A great deal of wisdom andtrue worth may be with a slow tongue. God sometimes makes choice ofthose as his messengers, who have the least of the advantages of art ornature, that his grace in them may appear the more glorious. Christ'sdisciples were no orators, till the Holy Spirit made them such. Godcondescends to answer the excuse of Moses. Even self-diffidence, whenit hinders us from duty, or clogs us in duty, is very displeasing tothe Lord. But while we blame Moses for shrinking from this dangerousservice, let us ask our own hearts if we are not neglecting duties moreeasy, and less perilous. The tongue of Aaron, with the head and heartof Moses, would make one completely fit for this errand. God promises,I will be with thy mouth, and with his mouth. Even Aaron, who couldspeak well, yet could not speak to purpose, unless God gave constantteaching and help; for without the constant aid of Divine grace, thebest gifts will fail.
Exo 4:18-23	<br>After God had appeared in the bush, he often spake to Moses. Pharaohhad hardened his own heart against the groans and cries of theoppressed Israelites; and now God, in the way of righteous judgment,hardens his heart against the teaching of the miracles, and the terrorof the plagues. But whether Pharaoh will hear, or whether he willforbear, Moses must tell him, Thus saith the Lord. He must demand adischarge for Israel, Let my son go; not only my servant, whom thouhast no right to detain, but my son. It is my son that serves me, andtherefore must be spared, must be pleaded for. In case of refusal Iwill slay thy son, even thy first-born. As men deal with God's people,let them expect so to be dealt with.
Exo 4:24-31	<br>God met Moses in anger. The Lord threatened him with death or sentsickness upon him, as the punishment of his having neglected tocircumcise his son. When God discovers to us what is amiss in ourlives, we must give all diligence to amend it speedily. This is thevoice of every rod; it calls us to return to Him that smites us. Godsent Aaron to meet Moses. The more they saw of God's bringing themtogether, the more pleasant their interview was. The elders of Israelmet them in faith, and were ready to obey them. It often happens, thatless difficulty is found than was expected, in such undertakings as areaccording to the will of God, and for his glory. Let us but arise andtry at our proper work, the Lord will be with us and prosper us. IfIsrael welcomed the tidings of their deliverance, and worshipped theLord, how should we welcome the glad tidings of redemption, embrace itin faith, and adore the Redeemer!
Exo 5:1-9	<br>God will own his people, though poor and despised, and will find a timeto plead their cause. Pharaoh treated all he had heard with contempt.He had no knowledge of Jehovah, no fear of him, no love to him, andtherefore refused to obey him. Thus Pharaoh's pride, ambition,covetousness, and political knowledge, hardened him to his owndestruction. What Moses and Aaron ask is very reasonable, only to gothree days' journey into the desert, and that on a good errand. We willsacrifice unto the Lord our God. Pharaoh was very unreasonable, insaying that the people were idle, and therefore talked of going tosacrifice. He thus misrepresents them, that he might have a pretence toadd to their burdens. To this day we find many who are more disposed tofind fault with their neighbours, for spending in the service of God afew hours spared from their wordly business, than to blame others, whogive twice the time to sinful pleasures. Pharaoh's command wasbarbarous. Moses and Aaron themselves must get to the burdens.Persecutors take pleasure in putting contempt and hardship uponministers. The usual tale of bricks must be made, without the usualallowance of straw to mix with the clay. Thus more work was to be laidupon the men, which, if they performed, they would be broken withlabour; and if not, they would be punished.
Exo 5:10-23	<br>The Egyptian task-masters were very severe. See what need we have topray that we may be delivered from wicked men. The head-workmen justlycomplained to Pharaoh: but he taunted them. The malice of Satan hasoften represented the service and worship of God, as fit employmentonly for those who have nothing else to do, and the business only ofthe idle; whereas, it is the duty of those who are most busy in theworld. Those who are diligent in doing sacrifice to the Lord, will,before God, escape the doom of the slothful servant, though with menthey do not. The Israelites should have humbled themselves before God,and have taken to themselves the shame of their sin; but instead ofthat, they quarrel with those who were to be their deliverers. Mosesreturned to the Lord. He knew that what he had said and done, was byGod's direction; and therefore appeals to him. When we find ourselvesat any time perplexed in the way of our duty, we ought to go to God,and lay open our case before him by fervent prayer. Disappointments inour work must not drive us from our God, but still we must ponder whythey are sent.
Exo 6:1-9	<br>We are most likely to prosper in attempts to glorify God, and to beuseful to men, when we learn by experience that we can do nothing ofourselves; when our whole dependence is placed on him, and our onlyexpectation is from him. Moses had been expecting what God would do;but now he shall see what he will do. God would now be known by hisname Jehovah, that is, a God performing what he had promised, andfinishing his own work. God intended their happiness: I will take youto me for a people, a peculiar people, and I will be to you a God. Morethan this we need not ask, we cannot have, to make us happy. Heintended his own glory: Ye shall know that I am the Lord. These goodwords, and comfortable words, should have revived the droopingIsraelites, and have made them forget their misery; but they were sotaken up with their troubles, that they did not heed God's promises. Byindulging discontent and fretfulness, we deprive ourselves of thecomfort we might have, both from God's word and from his providence,and go comfortless.
Exo 6:10-13	<br>The faith of Moses was so feeble that he could scarcely be kept to hiswork. Ready obedience is always according to the strength of our faith.Though our weaknesses ought to humble us, yet they ought not todiscourage us from doing our best in any service we have to do for God.When Moses repeats his baffled arguments, he is argued with no longer,but God gives him and Aaron a charge, both to the children of Israel,and to Pharaoh. God's authority is sufficient to answer all objections,and binds all to obey, without murmuring or disputing, Php 2:14.
Exo 6:14-30	<br>Moses and Aaron were Israelites; raised up unto them of their brethren,as Christ also should be, who was to be the Prophet and Priest, theRedeemer and Lawgiver of the people of Israel. Moses returns to hisnarrative, and repeats the charge God had given him to deliver hismessage to Pharaoh, and his objection against it. Those who have spokenunadvisedly with their lips ought to reflect upon it with regret, asMoses seems to do here. "Uncircumcised," is used in Scripture to notethe unsuitableness there may be in any thing to answer its properpurpose; as the carnal heart and depraved nature of fallen man arewholly unsuited to the services of God, and to the purposes of hisglory. It is profitable to place no confidence in ourselves, all oursufficiency must be in the Lord. We never can trust ourselves toolittle, or our God too much. I can do nothing by myself, said theapostle, but I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me.
Exo 7:1-7	<br>God glorifies himself. He makes people know that he is Jehovah. Israelis made to know it by the performance of his promises to them, and theEgyptians by the pouring out of his wrath upon them. Moses, as theambassador of Jehovah, speaking in his name, laid commands uponPharaoh, denounced threatenings against him, and called for judgmentsupon him. Pharaoh, proud and great as he was, could not resist. Mosesstood not in awe of Pharaoh, but made him tremble. This seems to bemeant in the words, Thou shalt be a god unto Pharaoh. At length Mosesis delivered from his fears. He makes no more objections, but, beingstrengthened in faith, goes about his work with courage, and proceedsin it with perseverance.
Exo 7:8-13	<br>What men dislike, because it opposes their pride and lusts, they willnot be convinced of; but it is easy to cause them to believe thingsthey wish to be true. God always sends with his word full proofs of itsDivine authority; but when men are bent to disobey, and willing toobject, he often permits a snare to be laid wherein they are entangled.The magicians were cheats, trying to copy the real miracles of Moses bysecret sleights or jugglings, which to a small extent they succeeded indoing, so as to deceive the bystanders, but they were at length obligedto confess they could not any longer imitate the effects of Divinepower. None assist more in the destruction of sinners, than such asresist the truth by amusing men with a counterfeit resemblance of it.Satan is most to be dreaded when transformed into an angel of light.
Exo 7:14-25	<br>Here is the first of the ten plagues, the turning of the water intoblood. It was a dreadful plague. The sight of such vast rolling streamsof blood could not but strike horror. Nothing is more common thanwater: so wisely has Providence ordered it, and so kindly, that what isso needful and serviceable to the comfort of human life, should becheap and almost every where to be had; but now the Egyptians musteither drink blood, or die for thirst. Egypt was a pleasant land, butthe dead fish and blood now rendered it very unpleasant. It was arighteous plague, and justly sent upon the Egyptians; for Nile, theriver of Egypt, was their idol. That creature which we idolize, Godjustly takes from us, or makes bitter to us. They had stained the riverwith the blood of the Hebrews' children, and now God made that riverall blood. Never any thirsted after blood, but sooner or later they hadenough of it. It was a significant plague; Egypt had great dependenceupon their river, Zec 14:18; so that in smiting the river, they werewarned of the destruction of all the produce of their country. The loveof Christ to his disciples changes all their common mercies intospiritual blessings; the anger of God towards his enemies, renderstheir most valued advantages a curse and a misery to them. Aaron is tosummon the plague by smiting the river with his rod. It was done in thesight of Pharaoh and his attendants, for God's true miracles were notperformed as Satan's lying wonders; truth seeks no corners. See thealmighty power of God. Every creature is that to us which he makes itto be water or blood. See what changes we may meet with in the thingsof this world; what is always vain, may soon become vexatious. See whatmischievous work sin makes. If the things that have been our comfortsprove our crosses, we must thank ourselves. It is sin that turns ourwaters into blood. The plague continued seven days; and in all thattime Pharaoh's proud heart would not let him desire Moses to pray forthe removal of it. Thus the hypocrites in heart heap up wrath. Nowonder that God's anger is not turned away, but that his hand isstretched out still.
Exo 8:1-15	<br>Pharaoh is plagued with frogs; their vast numbers made them soreplagues to the Egyptians. God could have plagued Egypt with lions, orbears, or wolves, or with birds of prey, but he chose to do it by thesedespicable creatures. God, when he pleases, can arm the smallest partsof the creation against us. He thereby humbled Pharaoh. They shouldneither eat, nor drink, nor sleep in quiet; but wherever they were,they should be troubled by the frogs. God's curse upon a man willpursue him wherever he goes, and lie heavy upon him whatever he does.Pharaoh gave way under this plague. He promises that he will let thepeople go. Those who bid defiance to God and prayer, first or last,will be made to see their need of both. But when Pharaoh saw there wasrespite, he hardened his heart. Till the heart is renewed by the graceof God, the thoughts made by affliction do not abide; the convictionswear off, and the promises that were given are forgotten. Till thestate of the air is changed, what thaws in the sun will freeze again inthe shade.
Exo 8:16-19	<br>These lice were produced out of the dust of the earth; out of any partof the creation God can fetch a scourge, with which to correct thosewho rebel against him. Even the dust of the earth obeys him. These licewere very troublesome, as well as disgraceful to the Egyptians, whosepriests were obliged to take much pains that no vermin ever should befound about them. All the plagues inflicted on the Egyptians, hadreference to their national crimes, or were rendered particularlysevere by their customs. The magicians attempted to imitate it, butthey could not. It forced them to confess, This is the finger of God!The check and restraint put upon us, must needs be from a Divine power.Sooner or later God will force even his enemies to acknowledge his ownpower. Pharaoh, notwithstanding this, was more and more obstinate.
Exo 8:20-32	<br>Pharaoh was early at his false devotions to the river; and shall we befor more sleep and more slumber, when any service to the Lord is to bedone? The Egyptians and the Hebrews were to be marked in the plague offlies. The Lord knows them that are his, and will make it appear,perhaps in this world, certainly in the other, that he has set themapart for himself. Pharaoh unwillingly entered into a treaty with Mosesand Aaron. He is content they should sacrifice to their God, providedthey would do it in the land of Egypt. But it would be an abominationto God, should they offer the Egyptian sacrifices; and it would be anabomination to the Egyptians, should they offer to God the objects ofthe worship of the Egyptians, namely, their calves or oxen. Those whowould offer acceptable sacrifice to God, must separate themselves fromthe wicked and profane. They must also retire from the world. Israelcannot keep the feast of the Lord, either among the brick-kilns oramong the flesh-pots of Egypt. And they must sacrifice as God shallcommand, not otherwise. Though they were in slavery to Pharaoh, yetthey must obey God's commands. Pharaoh consents for them to go into thewilderness, provided they do not go so far but that he might fetch themback again. Thus, some sinners, in a pang of conviction, part withtheir sins, yet are loth they should go very far away; for when thefright is over, they will turn to them again. Moses promised theremoval of this plague. But let not Pharaoh deal deceitfully any more.Be not deceived; God is not mocked: if we think to cheat God by a shamrepentance and a false surrender of ourselves to him, we shall put afatal cheat upon our own souls. Pharaoh returned to his hardness.Reigning lusts break through the strongest bonds, and make men presumeand go from their word. Many seem in earnest, but there is somereserve, some beloved, secret sin. They are unwilling to look uponthemselves as in danger of everlasting misery. They will refrain fromother sins; they do much, give much, and even punish themselves much.They will leave it off sometimes, and, as it were, let their sin departa little way; but will not make up their minds to part with all andfollow Christ, bearing the cross. Rather than that, they venture all.They are sorrowful, but depart from Christ, determined to keep theworld at present, and they hope for some future season, when salvationmay be had without such costly sacrifices; but, at length, the poorsinner is driven away in his wickedness, and left without hope tolament his folly.
Exo 9:1-7	<br>God will have Israel released, Pharaoh opposes it, and the trial is,whose word shall stand. The hand of the Lord at once is upon thecattle, many of which, some of all kinds, die by a sort of murrain.This was greatly to the loss of the owners; they had made Israel poor,and now God would make them poor. The hand of God is to be seen, evenin the sickness and death of cattle; for a sparrow falls not to theground without our Father. None of the Israelites' cattle should die;the Lord shall sever. The cattle died. The Egyptians worshipped theircattle. What we make an idol of, it is just with God to remove from us.This proud tyrant and cruel oppressor deserved to be made an example bythe just Judge of the universe. None who are punished according to whatthey deserve, can have any just cause to complain. Hardness of heartdenotes that state of mind upon which neither threatenings nor promise,neither judgements nor mercies, make any abiding impression. Theconscience being stupified, and the heart filled with pride andpresumption, they persist in unbelief and disobedience. This state ofmind is also called the stony heart. Very different is the heart offlesh, the broken and contrite heart. Sinners have none to blame butthemselves, for that pride and ungodliness which abuse the bounty andpatience of God. For, however the Lord hardens the hearts of men, it isalways as a punishment of former sins.
Exo 9:8-12	<br>When the Egyptians were not wrought upon by the death of their cattle,God sent a plague that seized their own bodies. If lesser judgments donot work, God will send greater. Sometimes God shows men their sin intheir punishment. They had oppressed Israel in the furnaces, and nowthe ashes of the furnace are made a terror to them. The plague itselfwas very grievous. The magicians themselves were struck with theseboils. Their power was restrained before; but they continued towithstand Moses, and to confirm Pharaoh in his unbelief, till they wereforced to give way. Pharaoh continued obstinate. He had hardened hisown heart, and now God justly gave him up to his own heart's lusts,permitting Satan to blind and harden him. If men shut their eyesagainst the light, it is just with God to close their eyes. This is thesorest judgment a man can be under out of hell.
Exo 9:13-21	<br>Moses is here ordered to deliver a dreadful message to Pharaoh.Providence ordered it, that Moses should have a man of such a fierceand stubborn spirit as this Pharaoh to deal with; and every thing madeit a most signal instance of the power of God has to humble and bringdown the proudest of his enemies. When God's justice threatens ruin,his mercy at the same time shows a way of escape from it. God not onlydistinguished between Egyptians and Israelites, but between someEgyptians and others. If Pharaoh will not yield, and so prevent thejudgment itself, yet those that will take warning, may take shelter.Some believed the things which were spoken, and they feared, and housedtheir servants and cattle, and it was their wisdom. Even among theservants of Pharaoh, some trembled at God's word; and shall not thesons of Israel dread it? But others believed not, and left their cattlein the field. Obstinate unbelief is deaf to the fairest warnings, andthe wisest counsels, which leaves the blood of those that perish upontheir own heads.
Exo 9:22-35	<br>Woful havoc this hail made: it killed both men and cattle; the cornabove ground was destroyed, and that only preserved which as yet wasnot come up. The land of Goshen was preserved. God causes rain or hailon one city and not on another, either in mercy or in judgment. Pharaohhumbled himself to Moses. No man could have spoken better: he ownshimself wrong; he owns that the Lord is righteous; and God must bejustified when he speaks, though he speaks in thunder and lightning.Yet his heart was hardened all this while. Moses pleads with God:though he had reason to think Pharaoh would repent of his repentance,and he told him so, yet he promises to be his friend. Moses went out ofthe city, notwithstanding the hail and lightning which kept Pharaoh andhis servants within doors. Peace with God makes men thunder-proof.Pharaoh was frightened by the tremendous judgment; but when that wasover, his fair promises were forgotten. Those that are not bettered byjudgments and mercies, commonly become worse.
Exo 10:1-11	<br>The plagues of Egypt show the sinfulness of sin. They warn the childrenof men not to strive with their Maker. Pharaoh had pretended to humblehimself; but no account was made of it, for he was not sincere therein.The plague of locusts is threatened. This should be much worse than anyof that kind which had ever been known. Pharaoh's attendants persuadehim to come to terms with Moses. Hereupon Pharaoh will allow the men togo, falsely pretending that this was all they desired. He swears thatthey shall not remove their little ones. Satan does all he can tohinder those that serve God themselves, from bringing their children toserve him. He is a sworn enemy to early piety. Whatever would put usfrom engaging our children in God's service, we have reason to suspectSatan in it. Nor should the young forget that the Lord's counsel is,Remember thy Creator in the days of thy youth; but Satan's counsel is,to keep children in a state of slavery to sin and to the world. Markthat the great foe of man wishes to retain him by the ties ofaffection, as Pharaoh would have taken hostages from the Israelites fortheir return, by holding their wives and children in captivity. Satanis willing to share our duty and our service with the Saviour, becausethe Saviour will not accept those terms.
Exo 10:12-20	<br>God bids Moses stretch out his hand; locusts came at the call. An armymight more easily have been resisted than this host of insects. Whothen is able to stand before the great God? They covered the face ofthe earth, and ate up the fruit of it. Herbs grow for the service ofman; yet when God pleases, insects shall plunder him, and eat the breadout of his mouth. Let our labour be, not for the habitation and meatthus exposed, but for those which endure to eternal life. Pharaohemploys Moses and Aaron to pray for him. There are those, who, indistress, seek the help of other people's prayers, but have no mind topray for themselves. They show thereby that they have no true love toGod, nor any delight in communion with him. Pharaoh desires only thatthis death might be taken away, not this sin. He wishes to get rid ofthe plague of locusts, not the plague of a hard heart, which was moredangerous. An east wind brought the locusts, a west wind carries themoff. Whatever point the wind is in, it is fulfilling God's word, andturns by his counsel. The wind bloweth where it listeth, as to us; butnot so as it respects God. It was also an argument for theirrepentance; for by this it appeared that God is ready to forgive, andswift to show mercy. If he does this upon the outward tokens ofhumiliation, what will he do if we are sincere! Oh that this goodnessof God might lead us to repentance! Pharaoh returned to his resolutionagain, not to let the people go. Those who have often baffled theirconvictions, are justly given up to the lusts of their hearts.
Exo 10:21-29	<br>The plague of darkness brought upon Egypt was a dreadful plague. It wasdarkness which might be felt, so thick were the fogs. It astonished andterrified. It continued three days; six nights in one; so long the mostlightsome palaces were dungeons. Now Pharaoh had time to consider, ifhe would have improved it. Spiritual darkness is spiritual bondage;while Satan blinds men's eyes that they see not, he binds their handsand feet, that they work not for God, nor move toward heaven. They sitin darkness. It was righteous with God thus to punish. The blindness oftheir minds brought upon them this darkness of the air; never was mindso blinded as Pharaoh's, never was air so darkened as Egypt. Let usdread the consequences of sin; if three days of darkness were sodreadful, what will everlasting darkness be? The children of Israel, atthe same time, had light in their dwellings. We must not think we sharein common mercies as a matter of course, and therefore that we owe nothanks to God for them. It shows the particular favour he bears to hispeople. Wherever there is an Israelite indeed, though in this darkworld, there is light, there is a child of light. When God made thisdifference between the Israelites and the Egyptians, who would not havepreferred the poor cottage of an Israelite to the fine palace of anEgyptian? There is a real difference between the house of the wicked,which is under a curse, and the habitation of the just, which isblessed. Pharaoh renewed the treaty with Moses and Aaron, and consentedthey should take their little ones, but would have their cattle left.It is common for sinners to bargain with God Almighty; thus they try tomock him, but they deceive themselves. The terms of reconciliation withGod are so fixed, that though men dispute them ever so long, theycannot possibly alter them, or bring them lower. We must come to thedemand of God's will; we cannot expect he should condescend to theterms our lusts would make. With ourselves and our children, we mustdevote all our worldly possessions to the service of God; we know notwhat use he will make of any part of what we have. Pharaoh broke offthe conference abruptly, and resolved to treat no more. Had heforgotten how often he had sent for Moses to ease him of his plagues?and must he now be bid to come no more? Vain malice! to threaten himwith death, who was armed with such power! What will not hardness ofheart, and contempt of God's word and commandments, bring men to! Afterthis, Moses came no more till he was sent for. When men drive God'sword from them, he justly gives them up to their own delusions.
Exo 11:1-3	<br>A secret revelation was made to Moses while in the presence of Pharaoh,that he might give warning of the last dreadful judgment, before hewent out. This was the last day of the servitude of Israel; they wereabout to go away. Their masters, who had abused them in their work,would have sent them away empty; but God provided that the labourersshould not lose their hire, and ordered them to demand it now, at theirdeparture, and it was given to them. God will right the injured, who inhumble silence commit their cause to him; and none are losers at lastby patient suffering. The Lord gave them favour in the sight of theEgyptians, by making it appear how much he favoured them. He alsochanged the spirit of the Egyptians toward them, and made them to bepitied of their oppressors. Those that honour God, he will honour.
Exo 11:4-10	<br>The death of all the first-born in Egypt at once: this plague had beenthe first threatened, but is last executed. See how slow God is towrath. The plague is foretold, the time is fixed; all their first-bornshould sleep the sleep of death, not silently, but so as to rouse thefamilies at midnight. The prince was not too high to be reached by it,nor the slaves at the mill too low to be noticed. While angels slew theEgyptians, not so much as a dog should bark at any of the children ofIsrael. It is an earnest of the difference there shall be in the greatday, between God's people and his enemies. Did men know what adifference God puts, and will put to eternity, between those that servehim and those that serve him not, religion would not seem to them anindifferent thing; nor would they act in it with so much carelessnessas they do. When Moses had thus delivered his message, he went out fromPharaoh in great anger at his obstinacy; though he was the meekest ofthe men of the earth. The Scripture has foretold the unbelief of manywho hear the gospel, that it might not be a surprise or stumbling-blockto us, Ro 10:16. Let us never think the worse of the gospel of Christfor the slights men put upon it. Pharaoh was hardened, yet he wascompelled to abate his stern and haughty demands, till the Israelitesgot full freedom. In like manner the people of God will find that everystruggle against their spiritual adversary, made in the might of JesusChrist, every attempt to overcome him by the blood of the Lamb, andevery desire to attain increasing likeness and love to that Lamb, willbe rewarded by increasing freedom from the enemy of souls.
Exo 12:1-20	<br>The Lord makes all things new to those whom he delivers from thebondage of Satan, and takes to himself to be his people. The time whenhe does this is to them the beginning of a new life. God appointedthat, on the night wherein they were to go out of Egypt, each familyshould kill a lamb, or that two or three families, if small, shouldkill one lamb. This lamb was to be eaten in the manner here directed,and the blood to be sprinkled on the door-posts, to mark the houses ofthe Israelites from those of the Egyptians. The angel of the Lord, whendestroying the first-born of the Egyptians, would pass over the housesmarked by the blood of the lamb: hence the name of this holy feast orordinance. The passover was to be kept every year, both as aremembrance of Israel's preservation and deliverance out of Egypt, andas a remarkable type of Christ. Their safety and deliverance were not areward of their own righteousness, but the gift of mercy. Of this theywere reminded, and by this ordinance they were taught, that allblessings came to them through the shedding and sprinkling of blood.Observe, 1. The paschal lamb was typical. Christ is our passover, 1Co5:7. Christ is the Lamb of God, Joh 1:29; often in the Revelation he iscalled the Lamb. It was to be in its prime; Christ offered up himselfin the midst of his days, not when a babe at Bethlehem. It was to bewithout blemish; the Lord Jesus was a Lamb without spot: the judge whocondemned Christ declared him innocent. It was to be set apart fourdays before, denoting the marking out of the Lord Jesus to be aSaviour, both in the purpose and in the promise. It was to be slain,and roasted with fire, denoting the painful sufferings of the LordJesus, even unto death, the death of the cross. The wrath of God is asfire, and Christ was made a curse for us. Not a bone of it must bebroken, which was fulfilled in Christ, Joh 19:33, denoting the unbrokenstrength of the Lord Jesus. 2. The sprinkling of the blood was typical.The blood of the lamb must be sprinkled, denoting the applying of themerits of Christ's death to our souls; we must receive the atonement,Ro 5:11. Faith is the bunch of hyssop, by which we apply the promises,and the benefits of the blood of Christ laid up in them, to ourselves.It was to be sprinkled on the door-posts, denoting the open professionwe are to make of faith in Christ. It was not to be sprinkled upon thethreshold; which cautions us to take heed of trampling under foot theblood of the covenant. It is precious blood, and must be precious tous. The blood, thus sprinkled, was a means of preserving the Israelitesfrom the destroying angel, who had nothing to do where the blood was.The blood of Christ is the believer's protection from the wrath of God,the curse of the law, and the damnation of hell, Ro 8:1. 3. The solemneating of the lamb was typical of our gospel duty to Christ. Thepaschal lamb was not to be looked upon only, but to be fed upon. So wemust by faith make Christ our own; and we must receive spiritualstrength and nourishment from him, as from our food, see Joh 6:53,55.It was all to be eaten; those who by faith feed upon Christ, must feedupon a whole Christ; they must take Christ and his yoke, Christ and hiscross, as well as Christ and his crown. It was to be eaten at once, notput by till morning. To-day Christ is offered, and is to be acceptedwhile it is called to-day, before we sleep the sleep of death. It wasto be eaten with bitter herbs, in remembrance of the bitterness oftheir bondage in Egypt; we must feed upon Christ with sorrow andbrokenness of heart, in remembrance of sin. Christ will be sweet to us,if sin be bitter. It was to be eaten standing, with their staves intheir hands, as being ready to depart. When we feed upon Christ byfaith, we must forsake the rule and the dominion of sin; sit loose tothe world, and every thing in it; forsake all for Christ, and reckon itno bad bargain, Heb 13:13,14. 4. The feast of unleavened bread wastypical of the Christian life, 1Co 5:7,8. Having received Christ Jesusthe Lord, we must continually delight ourselves in Christ Jesus. Nomanner of work must be done, that is, no care admitted and indulged,which does not agree with, or would lessen this holy joy. The Jews werevery strict as to the passover, so that no leaven should be found intheir houses. It must be a feast kept in charity, without the leaven ofmalice; and in sincerity, without the leaven of hypocrisy. It was by anordinance for ever; so long as we live we must continue feeding uponChrist, rejoicing in him always, with thankful mention of the greatthings he has done for us.
Exo 12:21-28	<br>That night, when the first-born were to be destroyed, no Israelite muststir out of doors till called to march out of Egypt. Their safety wasowing to the blood of sprinkling. If they put themselves from under theprotection of that, it was at their peril. They must stay within, towait for the salvation of the Lord; it is good to do so. In after-timesthey should carefully teach their children the meaning of this service.It is good for children to ask about the things of God; they that askfor the way will find it. The keeping of this solemnity every year was,1. To look backward, that they might remember what great things God haddone for them and their fathers. Old mercies, to ourselves, or to ourfathers, must not be forgotten, that God may be praised, and our faithin him encouraged. 2. It was designed to look forward, as an earnest ofthe great sacrifice of the Lamb of God in the fulness of time. Christour passover was sacrificed for us; his death was our life.
Exo 12:29-36	<br>The Egyptians had been for three days and nights kept in anxiety andhorror by the darkness; now their rest is broken by a far more terriblecalamity. The plague struck their first-born, the joy and hope of theirfamilies. They had slain the Hebrews' children, now God slew theirs. Itreached from the throne to the dungeon: prince and peasant stand uponthe same level before God's judgments. The destroying angel enteredevery dwelling unmarked with blood, as the messenger of woe. He did hisdreadful errand, leaving not a house in which there was not one dead.Imagine then the cry that rang through the land of Egypt, the long,loud shriek of agony that burst from every dwelling. It will be thus inthat dreadful hour when the Son of man shall visit sinners with thelast judgment. God's sons, his first-born, were now released. Men hadbetter come to God's terms at first, for he will never come to theirs.Now Pharaoh's pride is abased, and he yields. God's word will stand; weget nothing by disputing, or delaying to submit. In this terror theEgyptians would purchase the favour and the speedy departure of Israel.Thus the Lord took care that their hard-earned wages should be paid,and the people provided for their journey.
Exo 12:37-42	<br>The children of Israel set forward without delay. A mixed multitudewent with them. Some, perhaps, willing to leave their country, laidwaste by plagues; others, out of curiosity; perhaps a few out of loveto them and their religion. But there were always those among theIsraelites who were not Israelites. Thus there are still hypocrites inthe church. This great event was 430 years from the promise made toAbraham: see Ga 3:17. So long the promise of a settlement wasunfulfilled. But though God's promises are not performed quickly, theywill be, in their season. This is that night of the Lord, thatremarkable night, to be celebrated in all generations. The great thingsGod does for his people, are to be not only a few days' wonder, but tobe remembered throughout all ages; especially the work of ourredemption by Christ. This first passover-night was a night of theLord, much to be observed; but the last passover-night, in which Christwas betrayed and in which the first passover, with the rest of theJewish ceremonies, was done away, was a night of the Lord, much more tobe observed. Then a yoke, heavier than that of Egypt, was broken fromoff our necks, and a land, better than that of Canaan, set before us.It was a redemption to be celebrated in heaven, for ever and ever.
Exo 12:43-51	<br>In times to come, all the congregation of Israel must keep thepassover. All that share in God's mercies should join in thankfulpraises for them. The New Testament passover, the Lord's supper, oughtnot to be neglected by any. Strangers, if circumcised, might eat of thepassover. Here is an early indication of favour to the gentiles. Thistaught the Jews that their being a nation favoured by God, entitledthem to their privileges, not their descent from Abraham. Christ ourpassover is sacrificed for us, 1Co 5:7; his blood is the only ransomfor our souls; without the shedding of it there is no remission;without the sprinkling of it there can be no salvation. Have we, byfaith in him, sheltered our souls from deserved vengeance under theprotection of his atoning blood? Do we keep close to him, constantlydepending upon him? Do we so profess our faith in the Redeemer, and ourobligations to him, that all who pass by may know to whom we belong? Dowe stand prepared for his service, ready to walk in his ways, and toseparate ourselves from his enemies? These are questions of vastimportance to the soul; may the Lord direct our consciences honestly toanswer them.
Exo 13:1-10	<br>In remembrance of the destruction of the first-born of Egypt, both ofman and of beast, and the deliverance of the Israelites out of bondage,the first-born males of the Israelites were set apart to the Lord. Bythis was set before them, that their lives were preserved through theransom of the atonement, which in due time was to be made for sin. Theywere also to consider their lives, thus ransomed from death, as now tobe consecrated to the service of God. The parents were not to look uponthemselves as having any right in their first-born, till they solemnlypresented them to God, and allowed his title to them. That which is, byspecial mercy, spared to us, should be applied to God's honour; atleast, some grateful acknowledgment, in works of piety and charity,should be made. The remembrance of their coming out of Egypt must bekept up every year. The day of Christ's resurrection is to beremembered, for in it we were raised up with Christ out of death'shouse of bondage. The Scripture tells us not expressly what day of theyear Christ rose, but it states particularly what day of the week itwas; as the more valuable deliverance, it should be remembered weekly.The Israelites must keep the feast of unleavened bread. Under thegospel, we must not only remember Christ, but observe his holy supper.Do this in remembrance of him. Also care must be taken to teachchildren the knowledge of God. Here is an old law for catechising. Itis of great use to acquaint children betimes with the histories of theBible. And those who have God's law in their heart should have it intheir mouth, and often speak of it, to affect themselves, and to teachothers.
Exo 13:11-16	<br>The firstlings of beast not used in sacrifice, were to be changed forothers so used, or they were to be destroyed. Our souls are forfeitedto God's justice, and unless ransomed by the sacrifice of Christ, willcertainly perish. These institutions would continually remind them oftheir duty, to love and serve the Lord. In like manner, baptism and theLord's supper, if explained and attended to, would remind us, and giveus occasion to remind one another of our profession and duty.
Exo 13:17-20	<br>There were two ways from Egypt to Canaan. One was only a few days'journey; the other was much further about, through the wilderness, andthat was the way in which God chose to lead his people Israel. TheEgyptians were to be drowned in the Red sea; the Israelites were to behumbled and proved in the wilderness. God's way is the right way,though it seems about. If we think he leads not his people the nearestway, yet we may be sure he leads them the best way, and so it willappear when we come to our journey's end. The Philistines were powerfulenemies; it was needful that the Israelites should be prepared for thewars of Canaan, by passing through the difficulties of the wilderness.Thus God proportions his people's trials to their strength, 1Co 10:13.They went up in good order. They went up in five in a rank, some; infive bands, so others, which it seems rather to their faith and hope,that God would bring them to Canaan, in expectation of which theycarried these bones with them while in the desert.
Exo 13:21,22	<br>The Lord went before them in a pillar, or appearance of the DivineMajesty. Christ was with the church in the wilderness, 1Co 10:9. Thosewhom God brings into a wilderness, he will not leave nor lose there,but will take care to lead them through it. It was great satisfactionto Moses and the pious Israelites, to be sure that they were underDivine guidance. Those who make the glory of God their end, and theword of God their rule, the Spirit of God the guide of theiraffections, and the providence of God the guide of their affairs, maybe sure that the Lord goes before them, though they cannot see it withtheir eyes: we must now live by faith. When Israel marched, this pillarwent before, and pointed out the place of encampment, as Divine Wisdomsaw fit. It sheltered by day from the heat, and gave light by night.The Bible is a light to our feet, a lantern to our paths, with whichthe Saviour's love has provided us. It testifies of Christ. It is to uslike the pillar to the Israelites. Listen to that voice which cries, Iam the Light of the world; he that followeth me shall not walk indarkness, but shall have the Light of life, Joh 8:12. Jesus Christalone, as shown in the Bible, and as the Holy Spirit, in answer toprayer, recommends him to the soul, is the Way, the Truth, and theLife, Joh 14:6.
Exo 14:1-9	<br>Pharaoh would think that all Israel was entangled in the wilderness,and so would become an easy prey. But God says, I will be honoured uponPharaoh. All men being made for the honour of their Maker, those whomhe is not honoured by, he will be honoured upon. What seems to tend tothe church's ruin, is often overruled to the ruin of the church'senemies. While Pharaoh gratified his malice and revenge, he furtheredthe bringing to pass God's counsels concerning him. Though with thegreatest reason he had let Israel go, yet now he was angry with himselffor it. God makes the envy and rage of men against his people, atorment to themselves. Those who set their faces heavenward, and willlive godly in Christ Jesus, must expect to be set upon by Satan'stemptations and terrors. He will not tamely part with any out of hisservice.
Exo 14:10-14	<br>There was no way open to Israel but upward, and thence theirdeliverance came. We may be in the way of duty, following God, andhastening toward heaven, yet may be troubled on every side. Some criedout unto the Lord; their fear led them to pray, and that was well. Godbrings us into straits, that he may bring us to our knees. Others criedout against Moses; fear set them murmuring as if God were not stillable to work miracles. They quarrel with Moses for bringing them out ofEgypt; and so were angry with God for the greatest kindness ever donethem; thus gross are the absurdities of unbelief. Moses says, Fear yenot. It is always our duty and interest, when we cannot get out oftroubles, yet to get above our fears; let them quicken our prayers andendeavours, but not silence our faith and hope. "Stand still," thinknot to save yourselves either by fighting or flying; wait God's orders,and observe them. Compose yourselves, by confidence in God, intopeaceful thoughts of the great salvation God is about to work for you.If God brings his people into straits, he will find a way to bring themout.
Exo 14:15-20	<br>Moses' silent prayers of faith prevailed more with God than Israel'sloud outcries of fear. The pillar of cloud and fire came behind them,where they needed a guard, and it was a wall between them and theirenemies. The word and providence of God have a black and dark sidetoward sin and sinners, but a bright and pleasant side toward thepeople of the Lord. He, who divided between light and darkness, Ge 1:4,allotted darkness to the Egyptians, and light to the Israelites. Such adifference there will be between the inheritance of the saints inlight, and that utter darkness which will be the portion of hypocritesfor ever.
Exo 14:21-31	<br>The dividing the Red sea was the terror of the Canaanites, Jos 2:9; thepraise and triumph of the Israelites, Ps 114:3; 106:9; 136:13. It was atype of baptism, 1Co 10:1,2. Israel's passage through it was typicalof the conversion of souls, Isa 11:15; and the Egyptians being drownedin it was typical of the final ruin of all unrepenting sinners. Godshowed his almighty power, by opening a passage through the waters,some miles over. God can bring his people through the greatestdifficulties, and force a way where he does not find it. It was aninstance of his wonderful favour to his Israel. They went through thesea, they walked upon dry land in the midst of the sea. This was done,in order to encourage God's people in all ages to trust him in thegreatest straits. What cannot he do who did this? What will not he dofor those that fear and love him, who did this for these murmuring,unbelieving Israelites? Then followed the just and righteous wrath ofGod upon his and his people's enemies. The ruin of sinners is broughton by their own rage and presumption. They might have let Israel alone,and would not; now they would flee from the face of Israel, and cannot.Men will not be convinced, till it is too late, that those who meddlewith God's people, meddle to their own hurt. Moses was ordered tostretch out his hand over the sea; the waters returned, and overwhelmedall the host of the Egyptians. Pharaoh and his servants, who hadhardened one another in sin, now fell together, not one escaped. TheIsraelites saw the Egyptians dead upon the sands. The sight very muchaffected them. While men see God's works, and feel the benefit, theyfear him and trust in him. How well were it for us, if we were alwaysin as good a frame as sometimes! Behold the end to which a Christianmay look forward. His enemies rage, and are mighty; but while he holdsfast by God, he shall pass the waves in safety guarded by that verypower of his Saviour, which shall come down on every spiritual foe. Theenemies of his soul whom he hath seen to-day, he shall see no more forever.
Exo 15:1-21	<br>This song is the most ancient we know of. It is a holy song, to thehonour of God, to exalt his name, and celebrate his praise, and hisonly, not in the least to magnify any man. Holiness to the Lord is inevery part of it. It may be considered as typical, and prophetical ofthe final destruction of the enemies of the church. Happy the peoplewhose God is the Lord. They have work to do, temptations to grapplewith, and afflictions to bear, and are weak in themselves; but hisgrace is their strength. They are often in sorrow, but in him they havecomfort; he is their song. Sin, and death, and hell threaten them, buthe is, and will be their salvation. The Lord is a God of almightypower, and woe to those that strive with their Maker! He is a God ofmatchless perfection; he is glorious in holiness; his holiness is hisglory. His holiness appears in the hatred of sin, and his wrath againstobstinate sinners. It appears in the deliverance of Israel, and hisfaithfulness to his own promise. He is fearful in praises; that whichis matter of praise to the servants of God, is very dreadful to hisenemies. He is doing wonders, things out of the common course ofnature; wondrous to those in whose favour they are wrought, who are sounworthy, that they had no reason to expect them. There were wonders ofpower and wonders of grace; in both, God was to be humbly adored.
Exo 15:22-27	<br>In the wilderness of Shur the Israelites had no water. At Marah theyhad water, but it was bitter; so that they could not drink it. God canmake bitter to us that from which we promise ourselves most, and oftendoes so in the wilderness of this world, that our wants, anddisappointments in the creature, may drive us to the Creator, in whosefavour alone true comfort is to be had. In this distress the peoplefretted, and quarrelled with Moses. Hypocrites may show highaffections, and appear earnest in religious exercises, but in the timeof temptation they fall away. Even true believers, in seasons of sharptrial, will be tempted to fret, distrust, and murmur. But in everytrial we should cast our care upon the Lord, and pour out our heartsbefore him. We shall then find that a submissive will, a peacefulconscience, and the comforts of the Holy Ghost, will render thebitterest trial tolerable, yea, pleasant. Moses did what the people hadneglected to do; he cried unto the Lord. And God provided graciouslyfor them. He directed Moses to a tree which he cast into the waters,when, at once, they were made sweet. Some make this tree typical of thecross of Christ, which sweetens the bitter waters of affliction to allthe faithful, and enables them to rejoice in tribulation. But arebellious Israelite shall fare no better than a rebellious Egyptian.The threatening is implied only, the promise is expressed. God is thegreat Physician. If we are kept well, it is he that keeps us; if we aremade well, it is he that recovers us. He is our life and the length ofour days. Let us not forget that we are kept from destruction, anddelivered from our enemies, to be the Lord's servants. At Elim they hadgood water, and enough of it. Though God may, for a time, order hispeople to encamp by the bitter waters of Marah, that shall not alwaysbe their lot. Let us not faint at tribulations.
Exo 16:1-12	<br>The provisions of Israel, brought from Egypt, were spent by the middleof the second month, and they murmured. It is no new thing for thegreatest kindness to be basely represented as the greatest injuries.They so far undervalue their deliverance, that they wished they haddied in Egypt; and by the hand of the Lord, that is, by the plagueswhich cut off the Egyptians. We cannot suppose they had plenty inEgypt, nor could they fear dying for want in the wilderness, while theyhad flocks and herds: none talk more absurdly than murmurers. When webegin to fret, we ought to consider, that God hears all our murmurings.God promises a speedy and constant supply. He tried whether they wouldtrust him, and rest satisfied with the bread of the day in its day.Thus he tried if they would serve him, and it appeared how ungratefulthey were. When God plagued the Egyptians, it was to make them know hewas their Lord; when he provided for the Israelites, it was to makethem know he was their God.
Exo 16:13-21	<br>At evening the quails came up, and the people caught with ease as manyas they needed. The manna came down in dew. They called it "Manna,Manhu," which means, "What is this?" "It is a portion; it is that whichour God has allotted us, and we will take it, and be thankful." It waspleasant food; it was wholesome food. The manna was rained from heaven;it appeared, when the dew was gone, as a small round thing, as small asthe hoar frost, like coriander seed, in colour like pearls. The mannafell only six days in the week, and in double quantity on the sixthday; it bred worms and became offensive if kept more than one day,excepting on the sabbath. The people had never seen it before. It couldbe ground in a mill, or beaten in a mortar, and was then made intocakes and baked. It continued the forty years the Israelites were inthe wilderness, wherever they went, and ceased when they arrived inCanaan. All this shows how different it was from any thing foundbefore, or found now. They were to gather the manna every morning. Weare hereby taught, 1. To be prudent and diligent in providing food forourselves and our households; with quietness working, and eating ourown bread, not the bread of idleness or deceit. God's bounty leavesroom for man's duty; it did so even when manna was rained; they mustnot eat till they have gathered. 2. To be content with enough. Thosethat have most, have for themselves but food and raiment; those thathave least, generally have these; so that he who gathers much hasnothing over, and he who gathers little has no lack. There is not sucha disproportion between one and another in the enjoyment of the thingsof this life, as in the mere possession of them. 3. To depend uponProvidence: let them sleep quietly, though they have no bread in theirtents, nor in all their camp, trusting that God, with the followingday, would bring them in their daily bread. It was surer and safer inGod's storehouse than their own, and would come thence sweeter andfresher. See here the folly of hoarding. The manna laid up by some, whothought themselves wiser, and better managers, than their neighbours,and who would provide lest it should fail next day, bred worms, andbecame good for nothing. That will prove to be most wasted, which iscovetously and distrustfully spared. Such riches are corrupted, Jas5:2,3. The same wisdom, power, and goodness that brought food dailyfrom above for the Israelites in the wilderness, brings food yearly outof the earth in the constant course of nature, and gives us all thingsrichly to enjoy.
Exo 16:22-31	<br>Here is mention of a seventh-day sabbath. It was known, not only beforethe giving of the law upon mount Sinai, but before the bringing ofIsrael out of Egypt, even from the beginning, Ge 2:3. The setting apartone day in seven for holy work, and, in order to that, for holy rest,was ever since God created man upon the earth, and is the most ancientof the Divine laws. Appointing them to rest on the seventh day, he tookcare that they should be no losers by it; and none ever will be losersby serving God. On that day they were to fetch in enough for two days,and to make it ready. This directs us to contrive family affairs, sothat they may hinder us as little as possible in the work of thesabbath. Works of necessity are to be done on that day; but it isdesirable to have as little as may be to do, that we may applyourselves the more closely to prepare for the life that is to come.When they kept manna against a command, it stank; when they kept it bya command, it was sweet and good; every thing is sanctified by the wordof God and prayer. On the seventh day God did not send the manna,therefore they must not expect it, nor go out to gather. This showedthat it was produced by miracle.
Exo 16:32-36	<br>God having provided manna to be his people's food in the wilderness,the remembrance of it was to be preserved. Eaten bread must not beforgotten. God's miracles and mercies are to be had in remembrance. Theword of God is the manna by which our souls are nourished, Mt 4:4. Thecomforts of the Spirit are hidden manna, Re 2:17. These come fromheaven, as the manna did, and are the support and comfort of the Divinelife in the soul, while we are in the wilderness of this world. Christin the word is to be applied to the soul, and the means of grace are tobe used. We must every one of us gather for ourselves, and gather inthe morning of our days, the morning of our opportunities; which if welet slip, it may be too late to gather. The manna must not be hoardedup, but eaten; those who have received Christ, must by faith live uponhim, and not receive his grace in vain. There was manna enough for all,enough for each, and none had too much; so in Christ there is enough,but not more than we need. But those who ate manna, hungered again,died at last, and with many of them God was not well pleased; whereasthey that feed on Christ by faith, shall never hunger, and shall die nomore, and with them God will be for ever well pleased. Let us seekearnestly for the grace of the Holy Spirit, to turn all our knowledgeof the doctrine of Christ crucified, into the spiritual nourishment ofour souls by faith and love.
Exo 17:1-7	<br>The children of Israel journeyed according to the commandment of theLord, led by the pillar of cloud and fire, yet they came to a placewhere there was no water for them to drink. We may be in the way ofduty, yet may meet with troubles, which Providence brings us into, forthe trial of our faith, and that God may be glorified in our relief.They began to question whether God was with them or not. This is calledtheir "tempting God," which signifies distrust of him after they hadreceived such proofs of his power and goodness. Moses mildly answeredthem. It is folly to answer passion with passion; that makes bad worse.God graciously appeared to help them. How wonderful the patience andforbearance of God toward provoking sinners! That he might show hispower as well as his pity, and make it a miracle of mercy, he gave themwater out of a rock. God can open fountains for us where we leastexpect them. Those who, in this wilderness, keep to God's way, maytrust him to provide for them. Also, let this direct us to depend onChrist's grace. The apostle says, that Rock was Christ, 1Co 10:4, itwas a type of him. While the curse of God might justly have beenexecuted upon our guilty souls, behold the Son of God is smitten forus. Let us ask and receive. There was a constant, abundant supply ofthis water. Numerous as believers are, the supply of the Spirit ofChrist is enough for all. The water flowed from the rock in streams torefresh the wilderness, and attended them on their way towards Canaan;and this water flows from Christ, through the ordinances, in the barrenwilderness of this world, to refresh our souls, until we come to glory.A new name was given to the place, in remembrance, not of the mercy oftheir supply, but of the sin of their murmuring: "Massah," Temptation,because they tempted God; "Meribah," Strife, because they chid withMoses. Sin leaves a blot upon the name.
Exo 17:8-16	<br>Israel engaged with Amalek in their own necessary defence. God makeshis people able, and calls them to various services for the good of hischurch. Joshua fights, Moses prays, both minister to Israel. The rodwas held up, as the banner to encourage the soldiers. Also to God, byway of appeal to him. Moses was tired. The strongest arm will fail withbeing long held out; it is God only whose hand is stretched out still.We do not find that Joshua's hands were heavy in fighting, but Moses'hands were heavy in praying; the more spiritual any service is, themore apt we are to fail and flag in it. To convince Israel that thehand of Moses, whom they had been chiding, did more for their safetythan their own hands, his rod than their sword, the success rises andfalls as Moses lifts up or lets down his hands. The church's cause ismore or less successful, as her friends are more or less strong infaith, and fervent in prayer. Moses, the man of God, is glad of help.We should not be shy, either of asking help from others, or of givinghelp to others. The hands of Moses being thus stayed, were steady tillthe going down of the sun. It was great encouragement to the people tosee Joshua before them in the field of battle, and Moses above them onthe hill. Christ is both to us; our Joshua, the Captain of oursalvation, who fights our battles, and our Moses, who ever lives,making intercession above, that our faith fail not. Weapons formedagainst God's Israel cannot prosper long, and shall be broken at last.Moses must write what had been done, what Amalek had done againstIsrael; write their bitter hatred; write their cruel attempts; let themnever be forgotten, nor what God had done for Israel in saving themfrom Amalek. Write what should be done; that in process of time Amalekshould be totally ruined and rooted out. Amalek's destruction wastypical of the destruction of all the enemies of Christ and hiskingdom.
Exo 18:1-6	<br>Jethro came to rejoice with Moses in the happiness of Israel, and tobring his wife and children to him. Moses must have his family withhim, that while he ruled the church of God, he might set a good examplein family government, 1Ti 3:5.
Exo 18:7-12	<br>Conversation concerning God's wondrous works is good, and edifies.Jethro not only rejoiced in the honour done to his son-in-law, but inall the goodness done to Israel. Standers-by were more affected withthe favours God had showed to Israel, than many were who received them.Jethro gave the glory to Israel's God. Whatever we have the joy of, Godmust have the praise. They joined in a sacrifice of thanksgiving.Mutual friendship is sanctified by joint worship. It is very good forrelations and friends to join in the spiritual sacrifice of prayer andpraise, as those that meet in Christ. This was a temperate feast; theydid eat bread, manna. Jethro must see and taste that bread from heaven,and though a gentile, is welcome: the gentiles are welcomed to Christthe Bread of life.
Exo 18:13-27	<br>Here is the great zeal and the toil of Moses as a magistrate. Havingbeen employed to redeem Israel out of the house of bondage, he is afurther type of Christ, that he is employed as a lawgiver and a judgeamong them. If the people were as quarrelsome one with another as theywere with God, no doubt Moses had many causes brought before him. Thisbusiness Moses was called to; it appears that he did it with great careand kindness. The meanest Israelite was welcome to bring his causebefore him. Moses kept to his business from morning to night. Jethrothought it was too much for him to undertake alone; also it would makethe administration of justice tiresome to the people. There may beover-doing even in well-doing. Wisdom is profitable to direct, that wemay neither content ourselves with less than our duty, nor taskourselves beyond our strength. Jethro advised Moses to a better plan.Great men should not only study to be useful themselves, but contriveto make others useful. Care must be taken in the choice of the personsadmitted into such a trust. They should be men of good sense, thatunderstood business, and that would not be daunted by frowns orclamours, but abhorred the thought of a bribe. Men of piety andreligion; such as fear God, who dare not to do a base thing, thoughthey could do it secretly and securely. The fear of God will bestfortify a man against temptations to injustice. Moses did not despisethis advice. Those are not wise, who think themselves too wise to becounselled.
Exo 19:1-8	<br>Moses was called up the mountain, and was employed as the messenger ofthis covenant. The Maker and first Mover of the covenant, is Godhimself. This blessed charter was granted out of God's own free grace.The covenant here mentioned was the national covenant, by which theIsraelites were a people under the government of Jehovah. It was a typeof the new covenant made with true believers in Christ Jesus; but, likeother types, it was only a shadow of good things to come. As a nationthey broke this covenant; therefore the Lord declared that he wouldmake a new covenant with Israel, writing his law, not upon tables ofstone, but in their hearts, Jer 31:33; Heb 8:7-10. The covenant spokenof in these places as ready to vanish away, is the national covenantwith Israel, which they forfeited by their sins. Unless we carefullyattend to this, we shall fall into mistakes while reading the OldTestament. We must not suppose that the nation of the Jews were underthe covenant of works, which knows nothing of repentance, faith in aMediator, forgiveness of sins, or grace; nor yet that the whole nationof Israel bore the character, and possessed the privileges of truebelievers, as being actually sharers in the covenant of grace. Theywere all under a dispensation of mercy; they had outward privileges andadvantages for salvation; but, like professing Christians, most restedtherein, and went no further. Israel consented to the conditions. Theyanswered as one man, All that the Lord hath spoken we will do. Oh thatthere had been such a heart in them! Moses, as a mediator, returned thewords of the people to God. Thus Christ, the Mediator, as a Prophet,reveals God's will to us, his precepts and promises; and then, as aPriest, offers up to God our spiritual sacrifices, not only of prayerand praise, but of devout affections, and pious resolutions, the workof his own Spirit in us.
Exo 19:9-15	<br>The solemn manner in which the law was delivered, was to impress thepeople with a right sense of the Divine majesty. Also to convince themof their own guilt, and to show that they could not stand in judgmentbefore God by their own obedience. In the law, the sinner discoverswhat he ought to be, what he is, and what he wants. There he learns thenature, necessity, and glory of redemption, and of being made holy.Having been taught to flee to Christ, and to love him, the law is therule of his obedience and faith.
Exo 19:16-25	<br>Never was there such a sermon preached, before or since, as this whichwas preached to the church in the wilderness. It might be supposed thatthe terrors would have checked presumption and curiosity in the people;but the hard heart of an unawakened sinner can trifle with the mostterrible threatenings and judgments. In drawing near to God, we mustnever forget his holiness and greatness, nor our own meanness andpollution. We cannot stand in judgment before him according to hisrighteous law. The convinced transgressor asks, What must I do to besaved? and he hears the voice, Believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, andthou shalt be saved. The Holy Ghost, who made the law to convince ofsin, now takes of the things of Christ, and shows them to us. In thegospel we read, Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law,being made a curse for us. We have redemption through his blood, eventhe forgiveness of sins. Through him we are justified from all things,from which we could not be justified by the law of Moses. But theDivine law is binding as a rule of life. The Son of God came down fromheaven, and suffered poverty, shame, agony, and death, not only toredeem us from its curse, but to bind us more closely to keep itscommands.
Exo 20:1,2	<br>God speaks many ways to the children of men; by conscience, byprovidences, by his voice, to all which we ought carefully to attend;but he never spake at any time so as he spake the TEN COMMANDMENTS.This law God had given to man before; it was written in his heart; butsin so defaced it, that it was necessary to revive the knowledge of it.The law is spiritual, and takes knowledge of the secret thoughts,desires, and dispositions of the heart. Its grand demand is love,without which outward obedience is mere hypocrisy. It requires perfect,unfailing, constant obedience; no law in the world admits disobedienceto itself. Whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in onepoint, he is guilty of all, Jas 2:10. Whether in the heart or theconduct, in thought, word, or deed, to omit or to vary any thing, issin, and the wages of sin is death.
Exo 20:3-11	<br>The first four of the ten commandments, commonly called the FIRSTtable, tell our duty to God. It was fit that those should be put first,because man had a Maker to love, before he had a neighbour to love. Itcannot be expected that he should be true to his brother, who is falseto his God. The first commandment concerns the object of worship,JEHOVAH, and him only. The worship of creatures is here forbidden.Whatever comes short of perfect love, gratitude, reverence, or worship,breaks this commandment. Whatsoever ye do, do all the glory of God. Thesecond commandment refers to the worship we are to render to the Lordour God. It is forbidden to make any image or picture of the Deity, inany form, or for any purpose; or to worship any creature, image, orpicture. But the spiritual import of this command extends much further.All kinds of superstition are here forbidden, and the using of merehuman inventions in the worship of God. The third commandment concernsthe manner of worship, that it be with all possible reverence andseriousness. All false oaths are forbidden. All light appealing to God,all profane cursing, is a horrid breach of this command. It matters notwhether the word of God, or sacred things, all such-like things breakthis commandment, and there is no profit, honour, or pleasure in them.The Lord will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain. Theform of the fourth commandment, "Remember," shows that it was not nowfirst given, but was known by the people before. One day in seven is tobe kept holy. Six days are allotted to worldly business, but not so asto neglect the service of God, and the care of our souls. On those dayswe must do all our work, and leave none to be done on the sabbath day.Christ allowed works of necessity, charity, and piety; for the sabbathwas made for man, and not man for the sabbath, Mr 2:27; but all worksof luxury, vanity, or self-indulgence in any form, are forbidden.Trading, paying wages, settling accounts, writing letters of business,worldly studies, trifling visits, journeys, or light conversation, arenot keeping this day holy to the Lord. Sloth and indolence may be acarnal, but not a holy rest. The sabbath of the Lord should be a day ofrest from worldly labour, and a rest in the service of God. Theadvantages from the due keeping of this holy day, were it only to thehealth and happiness of mankind, with the time it affords for takingcare of the soul, show the excellency of this commandment. The day isblessed; men are blessed by it, and in it. The blessing and directionto keep holy are not limited to the seventh day, but are spoken of thesabbath day.
Exo 20:12-17	<br>The laws of the SECOND table, that is, the last six of the tencommandments, state our duty to ourselves and to one another, andexplain the great commandment, Thou shalt love thy neighbour asthyself, Lu 10:27. Godliness and honesty must go together. The fifthcommandment concerns the duties we owe to our relations. Honour thyfather and thy mother, includes esteem of them, shown in our conduct;obedience to their lawful commands; come when they call you, go wherethey send you, do what they bid you, refrain from what they forbid you;and this, as children, cheerfully, and from a principle of love. Alsosubmission to their counsels and corrections. Endeavouring, in everything, to comfort parents, and to make their old age easy; maintainingthem if they need support, which our Saviour makes to be particularlyintended in this commandment, Mt 15:4-6. Careful observers have noted apeculiar blessing in temporal things on obedient, and the reverse ondisobedient children. The sixth commandment requires that we regard thelife and the safety of others as we do our own. Magistrates and theirofficers, and witnesses testifying the truth, do not break thiscommand. Self-defence is lawful; but much which is not deemed murder bythe laws of man, is such before God. Furious passions, stirred up byanger or by drunkenness, are no excuse: more guilty is murder in duels,which is a horrible effect of a haughty, revengeful spirit. Allfighting, whether for wages, for renown, or out of anger and malice,breaks this command, and the bloodshed therein is murder. To tempt mento vice and crimes which shorten life, may be included. Misconduct,such as may break the heart, or shorten the lives of parents, wives, orother relatives, is a breach of this command. This command forbids allenvy, malice, hatred, or anger, all provoking or insulting language.The destruction of our own lives is here forbidden. This commandmentrequires a spirit of kindness, longsuffering, and forgiveness. Theseventh commandment concerns chastity. We should be as much afraid ofthat which defiles the body, as of that which destroys it. Whatevertends to pollute the imagination, or to raise the passions, falls underthis law, as impure pictures, books, conversation, or any other likematters. The eighth commandment is the law of love as it respects theproperty of others. The portion of worldly things allotted us, as faras it is obtained in an honest way, is the bread which God hath givenus; for that we ought to be thankful, to be contented with it, and, inthe use of lawful means, to trust Providence for the future. Imposingupon the ignorance, easiness, or necessity of others, and many otherthings, break God's law, though scarcely blamed in society. Plunderersof kingdoms though above human justice, will be included in thissentence. Defrauding the public, contracting debts without prospect ofpaying them, or evading payment of just debts, extravagance, all livingupon charity when not needful, all squeezing the poor in their wages;these, and such things, break this command; which requires industry,frugality, and content, and to do to others, about worldly property, aswe would they should do to us. The ninth commandment concerns our ownand our neighbour's good name. This forbids speaking falsely on anymatter, lying, equivocating, and any way devising or designing todeceive our neighbour. Speaking unjustly against our neighbour, to hurthis reputation. Bearing false witness against him, or in commonconversation slandering, backbiting, and tale-bearing; making what isdone amiss, worse than it is, and in any way endeavouring to raise ourreputation upon the ruin of our neighbour's. How much this command isevery day broken among persons of all ranks! The tenth commandmentstrikes at the root; Thou shalt not covet. The others forbid all desireof doing what will be an injury to our neighbour; this forbids allwrong desire of having what will gratify ourselves.
Exo 20:18-21	<br>This law, which is so extensive that we cannot measure it, so spiritualthat we cannot evade it, and so reasonable that we cannot find faultwith it, will be the rule of the future judgment of God, as it is forthe present conduct of man. If tried by this rule, we shall find ourlives have been passed in transgressions. And with this holy law and anawful judgment before us, who can despise the gospel of Christ? And theknowledge of the law shows our need of repentance. In every believer'sheart sin is dethroned and crucified, the law of God is written, andthe image of God renewed. The Holy Spirit enables him to hate sin andflee from it, to love and keep this law in sincerity and truth; norwill he cease to repent.
Exo 20:22-26	<br>Moses having entered into the thick darkness, God there spake in hishearing all that follows from hence to the end of chap. 23, which ismostly an exposition of the ten commandments. The laws in these versesrelate to God's worship. The Israelites are assured of God's graciousacceptance of their devotions. Under the gospel, men are encouraged topray every where, and wherever God's people meet in his name to worshiphim, he will be in the midst of them; there he will come unto them, andwill bless them.
Exo 21:1-11	<br>The laws in this chapter relate to the fifth and sixth commandments;and though they differ from our times and customs, nor are they bindingon us, yet they explain the moral law, and the rules of naturaljustice. The servant, in the state of servitude, was an emblem of thatstate of bondage to sin, Satan, and the law, which man is brought intoby robbing God of his glory, by the transgression of his precepts.Likewise in being made free, he was an emblem of that liberty wherewithChrist, the Son of God, makes free from bondage his people, who arefree indeed; and made so freely, without money and without price, offree grace.
Exo 21:12-21	<br>God, who by his providence gives and maintains life, by his lawprotects it. A wilful murderer shall be taken even from God's altar.But God provided cities of refuge to protect those whose unhappiness itwas, and not their fault, to cause the death of another; for such as byaccident, when a man is doing a lawful act, without intent of hurt,happens to kill another. Let children hear the sentence of God's wordupon the ungrateful and disobedient; and remember that God willcertainly requite it, if they have ever cursed their parents, even intheir hearts, or have lifted up their hands against them, except theyrepent, and flee for refuge to the Saviour. And let parents hence learnto be very careful in training up their children, setting them a goodexample, especially in the government of their passions, and in prayingfor them; taking heed not to provoke them to wrath. Through poverty theIsraelites sometimes sold themselves or their children; magistratessold some persons for their crimes, and creditors were in some casesallowed to sell their debtors who could not pay. But "man-stealing,"the object of which is to force another into slavery, is ranked in theNew Testament with the greatest crimes. Care is here taken, thatsatisfaction be made for hurt done to a person, though death do notfollow. The gospel teaches masters to forbear, and to moderatethreatenings, Eph 6:9, considering with Job, What shall I do, when Godriseth up? Job 31:13,14.
Exo 21:22-36	<br>The cases here mentioned give rules of justice then, and still in use,for deciding similar matters. We are taught by these laws, that we mustbe very careful to do no wrong, either directly or indirectly. If wehave done wrong, we must be very willing to make it good, and bedesirous that nobody may lose by us.
Exo 23:1-9	<br>In the law of Moses are very plain marks of sound moral feeling, and oftrue political wisdom. Every thing in it is suited to the desired andavowed object, the worship of one only God, and the separation ofIsrael from the pagan world. Neither parties, friends, witnesses, norcommon opinions, must move us to lessen great faults, to aggravatesmall ones, excuse offenders, accuse the innocent, or misrepresent anything.
Exo 23:10-19	<br>Every seventh year the land was to rest. They must not plough or sowit; what the earth produced of itself, should be eaten, and not laidup. This law seems to have been intended to teach dependence onProvidence, and God's faithfulness in sending the larger increase whilethey kept his appointments. It was also typical of the heavenly rest,when all earthly labours, cares, and interests shall cease for ever.All respect to the gods of the heathen is strictly forbidden. Sinceidolatry was a sin to which the Israelites leaned, they must blot outthe remembrance of the gods of the heathen. Solemn religious attendanceon God, in the place which he should choose, is strictly required. Theymust come together before the Lord. What a good Master do we serve, whohas made it our duty to rejoice before him! Let us devote with pleasureto the service of God that portion of our time which he requires, andcount his sabbaths and ordinances to be a feast unto our souls. Theywere not to come empty-handed; so now, we must not come to worship Godempty-hearted; our souls must be filled with holy desires toward him,and dedications of ourselves to him; for with such sacrifices God iswell pleased.
Exo 23:20-33	<br>It is here promised that they should be guided and kept in their waythrough the wilderness to the land of promise, Behold, I send an angelbefore thee, mine angel. The precept joined with this promise is, thatthey be obedient to this angel whom God would send before them. Christis the Angel of Jehovah; this is plainly taught by St. Paul, 1Co 10:9.They should have a comfortable settlement in the land of Canaan. Howreasonable are the conditions of this promise; that they should servethe only true God; not the gods of the nations, which are no gods atall. How rich are the particulars of this promise! The comfort of theirfood, the continuance of their health, the increase of their wealth,the prolonging their lives to old age. Thus hath godliness the promiseof the life that now is. It is promised that they should subdue theirenemies. Hosts of hornets made way for the hosts of Israel; such meancreatures can God use for chastising his people's enemies. In realkindness to the church, its enemies are subdued by little and little;thus we are kept on our guard, and in continual dependence on God.Corruptions are driven out of the hearts of God's people, not all atonce, but by little and little. The precept with this promise is, thatthey should not make friendship with idolaters. Those that would keepfrom bad courses, must keep from bad company. It is dangerous to livein a bad neighbourhood; others' sins will be our snares. Our greatestdanger is from those who would make us sin against God.
Exo 24:1-8	<br>A solemn covenant was made between God and Israel. Very solemn it was,typifying the covenant of grace between God and believers, throughChrist. As soon as God separated to himself a peculiar people, hegoverned them by a written word, as he has done ever since. God'scovenants and commands are so just in themselves, and so much for ourgood, that the more we think of them, and the more plainly and fullythey are set before us, the more reason we may see to comply with them.The blood of the sacrifice was sprinkled on the altar, on the book, andon the people. Neither their persons, their moral obedience, norreligious services, would meet with acceptance from a holy God, exceptthrough the shedding and sprinkling' of blood. Also the blessingsgranted unto them were all of mercy; and the Lord would deal with themin kindness. Thus the sinner, by faith in the blood of Christ, renderswilling and acceptable obedience. (Ex 24:9-11)
Exo 24:9-11	<br>The elders saw the God of Israel; they had some glimpse of his glory,though whatever they saw, it was something of which no image or picturecould be made, yet enough to satisfy them that God was with them of atruth. Nothing is described but what was under his feet. The sapphiresare the pavement under his feet; let us put all the wealth of thisworld under our feet, and not in our hearts. Thus the believer sees inthe face of Jesus Christ, far clearer discoveries of the gloriousjustice and holiness of God, than ever he saw under terrifyingconvictions; and through the Saviour, holds communion with a holy God.
Exo 24:12-18	<br>A cloud covered the mount six days; a token of God's special presencethere. Moses was sure that he who called him up would protect him. Eventhose glorious attributes of God which are most terrible to the wicked,the saints with humble reverence rejoice in. And through faith in theatoning Sacrifice, we hope for greater honour than Moses ever enjoyedon earth. Now we see through a glass darkly, but when he shall appear,then face to face. This vision of God will continue with equal, if notincreasing brightness of joy; not for a few days only, but througheternity.
Exo 25:1-9	<br>God chose the people of Israel to be a peculiar people to himself,above all people, and he himself would be their King. He ordered aroyal palace to be set up among them for himself, called a sanctuary,or holy place, or habitation. There he showed his presence among them.And because in the wilderness they dwelt in tents, this royal palacewas ordered to be a tabernacle, that it might move with them. Thepeople were to furnish Moses with the materials, by their own freewill. The best use we can make of our worldly wealth, is to honour Godwith it in works of piety and charity. We should ask, not only, Whatmust we do? but, What may we do for God? Whatever they gave, they mustgive it cheerfully, not grudgingly, for God loves a cheerful giver, 2Co9:7. What is laid out in the service of God, we must reckon wellbestowed; and whatsoever is done in God's service, must be done by hisdirection. (Ex 25:10-22)
Exo 25:10-22	<br>The ark was a chest, overlaid with gold, in which the two tables of thelaw were to be kept. These tables are called the testimony; God in themtestified his will. This law was a testimony to the Israelites, todirect them in their duty, and would be a testimony against them, ifthey transgressed. This ark was placed in the holy of holies; the bloodof the sacrifices was sprinkled, and the incense burned, before it, bythe high priest; and above it appeared the visible glory, which was thesymbol of the Divine presence. This was a type of Christ in his sinlessnature, which saw no corruption, in personal union with his Divinenature, atoning for our sins against it, by his death. The cherubim ofgold looked one towards another, and both looked downward toward theark. It denotes the angels' attendance on the Redeemer, their readinessto do his will, their presence in the assemblies of saints, and theirdesire to look into the mysteries of the gospel. It was covered with acovering of gold, called the mercy-seat. God is said to dwell, or sitbetween the cherubim, on the mercy-seat. There he would give his law,and hear supplicants, as a prince on his throne.
Exo 25:23-30	<br>A table was to be made of wood, overlaid with gold, to stand in theouter tabernacle, to be always furnished with the shew-bread. Thistable, with the articles on it, and its use, seems to typify thecommunion which the Lord holds with his redeemed people in hisordinances, the provisions of his house, the feasts they are favouredwith. Also the food for their souls, which they always find when theyhunger after it; and the delight he takes in their persons andservices, as presented before him in Christ.
Exo 25:31-40	<br>The candlestick represents the light of God's word and Spirit, in andthrough Christ Jesus, afforded in this dark world to his believingpeople, to direct their worship and obedience, and to afford themconsolations. The church is still dark, as the tabernacle was, incomparison with what it will be in heaven; but the word of God is alight shining in a dark place, 2Pe 1:19, and a dark place indeed theworld would be without it. In 
Exo 25:40) is an express caution toMoses. Nothing was left to his own fancy, or to that of the workmen, orthe people; but the will of God must be observed in every particular.Christ's instruction to his disciples, Mt 28:20, is like this, Observeall things whatsoever I have commanded you. Let us remember that we arethe temples of the Holy Ghost, that we have the law of God in ourhearts, that we are to live a life of communion with God, feast on hisordinances, and are the light of the world, if indeed we are followersof Christ. May the Lord help us to try ourselves by this view ofreligion, and to walk according thereto.	
Exo 26:1-6	<br>God manifested his presence among the Israelites in a tabernacle ortent, because of their condition in the wilderness. God suits thetokens of his favour, and the gifts of his grace, to his people's stateand wants. The curtains of the tabernacle were to be very rich. Theywere to be embroidered with cherubim, signifying that the angels of Godpitch their tents round about the church, Ps 34:7. (Ex 26:7-14)
Exo 26:7-14	<br>The curtains of meaner materials, being made both longer and broader,covered the others, and were defended by coverings of skins. The wholerepresents the person and doctrine of Christ, and the church of trueChristians, and all heavenly things, which outwardly are mean, butinwardly, and in the sight of God, are glorious and precious.
Exo 26:15-30	<br>The sockets of silver each weighed about 115 pounds; they were placedin rows on the ground. In every pair of these sockets, a strong boardof shittim-wood, covered with plates of gold, was fitted by mortisesand tenons. Thus walls were formed for the two sides, and for the westend. The wall was further held together by bars, which passed throughrings of gold. Over this the curtains were spread. Though movable, itwas strong and firm. The materials were very costly. In all this it wasa type of the church of God, built upon the foundation of the apostlesand prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief Corner-stone, Eph2:20,21.
Exo 26:31-37	<br>A vail, or curtain, separated the holy place from the most holy place.It was hung upon pillars. This vail was for a partition between theholy place and the most holy; which forbade any to look into theholiest of all. The apostle tells what was the meaning of this vail,Heb 9:8. That the ceremonial law could not make the comers thereuntoperfect, nor would the observance of it bring men to heaven; the wayinto the holiest of all was not made manifest, while the firsttabernacle was standing. Life and immortality lay hidden till they werebrought to light by the gospel; which was signified by the rending ofthis vail at the death of Christ, Mt 27:51. We have now boldness toenter into the holiest, in all acts of worship, by the blood of Jesus;yet such as obliges us to holy reverence. Another vail was for theouter door of the tabernacle. This vail was all the defence thetabernacle had. God takes care of his church on earth. A curtain shallbe, if God please to make it so, as strong a defence to his house, asgates of brass and bars of iron. With this typical description ofChrist and his church before us, what is our judgment of these matters?Do we see any glory in the person of Christ? any excellence in hischaracter? any thing precious in his salvation? or any wisdom in thedoctrine of the cross? Will our religion bear examination? and are wemore careful to approve our hearts to God than our characters towardmen?
Exo 27:1-8	<br>In the court before the tabernacle, where the people attended, was analtar, to which they must bring their sacrifices, and on which theirpriests must offer them to God. It was of wood overlaid with brass. Agrate of brass was let into the hollow of the altar, about the middleof which the fire was kept, and the sacrifice burnt. It was made ofnet-work like a sieve, and hung hollow, that the ashes might fallthrough. This brazen altar was a type of Christ dying to make atonementfor our sins. The wood had been consumed by the fire from heaven, if ithad not been secured by the brass: nor could the human nature of Christhave borne the wrath of God, if it had not been supported by Divinepower.
Exo 27:9-19	<br>The tabernacle was enclosed in a court, about sixty yards long andthirty broad, formed by curtains hung upon brazen pillars, fixed inbrazen sockets. Within this enclosure the priests and Levites offeredthe sacrifices, and thither the Jewish people were admitted. Thesedistinctions represented the difference between the visible nominalchurch, and the true spiritual church, which alone has access to God,and communion with him.
Exo 27:20,21	<br>The pure oil signified the gifts and graces of the Spirit, which allbelievers receive from Christ, the good Olive, and without which ourlight cannot shine before men. The priests were to light the lamps, andtend them. It is the work of ministers, by preaching and expounding theScriptures, which are as a lamp, to enlighten the church, God'stabernacle upon earth. Blessed be God, this light is not now confinedto the Jewish tabernacle, but is a light to lighten the gentiles, andfor salvation unto the ends of the earth.
Exo 28:1-5	<br>Hitherto the heads of families were the priests, and offeredsacrifices; but now this office was confined to the family of Aarononly; and so continued till the gospel dispensation. The holy garmentsnot only distinguished the priests from the people, but were emblems ofthat holy conduct which should ever be the glory and beauty, the markof the ministers of religion, without which their persons andministrations will be had in contempt. They also typified the glory ofthe Divine majesty, and the beauty of complete holiness, which renderedJesus Christ the great High Priest. But our adorning under the gospel,is not to be of gold and costly array, but the garments of salvation,the robe of righteousness.
Exo 28:6-14	<br>This richly-wrought ephod was the outmost garment of the high priest;plain linen ephods were worn by the inferior priests. It was a shortcoat without sleeves, fastened close to the body with a girdle. Theshoulder-pieces were buttoned together with precious stones set ingold, one on each shoulder, on which were engraven the names of thechildren of Israel. Thus Christ, our High Priest, presents his peoplebefore the Lord for a memorial. As Christ's coat had no seam, but waswoven from the top throughout, so it was with the ephod. The goldenbells on this ephod, by their preciousness and pleasant sound, wellrepresent the good profession that the saints make, and thepomegranates the fruit they bring forth.
Exo 28:15-30	<br>The chief ornament of the high priest, was the breastplate, a richpiece of cloth, curiously worked. The name of each tribe was graven ina precious stone, fixed in the breastplate, to signify how precious, inGod's sight, believers are, and how honourable. How small and poorsoever the tribe was, it was as a precious stone in the breastplate ofthe high priest; thus are all the saints dear to Christ, however menesteem them. The high priest had the names of the tribes, both on hisshoulders and on his breast, which reminds us of the power and the lovewith which our Lord Jesus pleads for those that are his. He not onlybears them up in his arms with almighty strength, but he carries themin his bosom with tender affection. What comfort is this to us in allour addresses to God! The Urim and Thummim, by which the will of Godwas made known in doubtful cases, were put in this breastplate. Urimand Thummim signify light and integrity. There are many conjectureswhat these were; the most probable opinion seems to be, that they werethe twelve precious stones in the high priest's breastplate. Now,Christ is our Oracle. By him God, in these last days, makes knownhimself and his mind to us, Heb 1:1,2; Joh 1:18. He is the true Light,the faithful Witness, the Truth itself, and from him we receive theSpirit of Truth, who leads into all truth.
Exo 28:31-39	<br>The robe of the ephod was under the ephod, and reached down to theknees, without sleeves. Aaron must minister in the garments appointed.We must serve the Lord with holy fear, as those who know they deserveto die. A golden plate was fixed on Aaron's forehead, engraven with"Holiness to the Lord." Aaron was hereby reminded that God is holy, andthat his priests must be holy, devoted to the Lord. This must appear intheir forehead, in open profession of their relation to God. It must beengraven like the engravings of a signet; deep and durable; not paintedso as to be washed off, but firm and lasting; such must our holiness tothe Lord be. Christ is our High Priest; through him sins are forgivento us, and not laid to our charge. Our persons, our doings, arepleasing to God upon the account of Christ, and not otherwise.
Exo 28:40-43	<br>The priest's garments typify the righteousness of Christ. If we appearnot before God in that, we shall bear our iniquity, and die. Blessed ishe, therefore, that watcheth, and keepeth his garments, Re 16:15. Andblessed be God that we have a High Priest, appointed of God, and setapart for his work; furnished for his high office by the glory of hisDivine majesty, and the beauty of perfect holiness. Happy are we, if bythe law spiritually understood, we see that such a High Priest becameus; that we cannot draw near to a holy God, or be accepted, but by him.There is no light, no wisdom, no perfection, but from him; no glory, nobeauty, but in being like unto him. Let us take encouragement from thepower, love, and compassion of our High Priest, to draw near withboldness to the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and findgrace to help in time of need.
Exo 29:1-37	<br>Aaron and his sons were to be set apart for the priest's office, withceremony and solemnity. Our Lord Jesus is the great High Priest of ourprofession, called of God to be so; anointed with the Spirit, whence heis called Messiah, the Christ; clothed with glory and beauty;sanctified by his own blood; made perfect, or consecrated throughsufferings, Heb 2:10. All believers are spiritual priests, to offerspiritual sacrifices, 1Pe 2:5, washed in the blood of Christ, and somade to our God priests, Re 1:5,6. They also are clothed with thebeauty of holiness, and have received the anointing, 1Jo 2:27. TheSpirit of God is called the finger of God, (Lu 11:20, compared with Mt12:28,) and by him the merit of Christ is applied to our souls. Thisconsecration signifies the admission of a sinner into the spiritualpriesthood, to offer spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God throughJesus Christ.
Exo 29:38-46	<br>A lamb was to be offered upon the altar every morning, and a lamb everyevening. This typified the continual intercession which Christ everlives to make for his church. Though he offered himself but once forall, that one offering thus becomes a continual offering. This alsoteaches us to offer to God the spiritual sacrifices of prayer andpraise every day, morning and evening. Our daily devotions are the mostneedful of our daily works, and the most pleasant of our dailycomforts. Prayer-time must be kept up as duly as meal-time. Thosestarve their own souls, who keep not up constant attendance on thethrone of grace; constancy in religion brings in the comfort of it.
Exo 30:1-10	<br>The altar of incense represented the Son of God in his human nature,and the incense burned thereon typified his pleading for his people.The continual intercession of Christ was represented by the dailyburning of incense thereon, morning and evening. Once every year theblood of the atonement was to be applied to it, denoting that theintercession of Christ has all its virtue from his sufferings on earth,and that we need no other sacrifice or intercessor but Christ alone.
Exo 30:11-16	<br>The tribute was half a shekel, about fifteen pence of our money. Therich were not to give more, nor the poor less; the souls of the richand poor are alike precious, and God is no respecter of persons, Ac10:34; Job 34:19. In other offerings men were to give according totheir wordly ability; but this, which was the ransom of the soul, mustbe alike for all. The souls of all are of equal value, equally indanger, and all equally need a ransom. The money raised was to be usedin the service of the tabernacle. Those who have the benefit, must notgrudge the necessary charges of God's public worship. Money cannot makeatonement for the soul, but it may be used for the honour of Him whohas made the atonement, and for the maintenance of the gospel by whichthe atonement is applied.
Exo 30:17-21	<br>A large vessel of brass, holding water, was to be set near the door ofthe tabernacle. Aaron and his sons must wash their hands and feet atthis laver, every time they went in to minister. This was to teach thempurity in all their services, and to dread the pollution of sin. Theymust not only wash and be made clean, when first made priests, but mustwash and be kept clean, whenever they went to minister. It teaches usdaily to attend upon God, daily to renew our repentance for sin, andour looking to the blood of Christ for remission; for in many things wedaily offend.
Exo 30:22-38	<br>Directions are here given for making the holy anointing oil, and theincense to be used in the service of the tabernacle. To show theexcellency of holiness, there was this spiced oil in the tabernacle,which was grateful to the sight and to the smell. Christ's name is asointment poured forth, So 1:3, and the good name of Christians is likeprecious ointment, Ec 7:1. The incense burned upon the golden altar wasprepared of sweet spices. When it was used, it was to be beaten verysmall; thus it pleased the Lord to bruise the Redeemer, when he offeredhimself for a sacrifice of a sweet-smelling savour. The like should notbe made for any common use. Thus God would keep in the people's mindsreverence for his own services, and teach us not to profane or abuseany thing whereby God makes himself known. It is a great affront to Godto jest with sacred things, and to make sport with his word andordinances. It is most dangerous and fatal to use professions of thegospel of Christ to forward wordly interests.
Exo 31:1-11	<br>The Israelites, who had been masons and bricklayers in Egypt, were notqualified for curious workmanship; but the Spirit who gave the apostlesutterance in divers tongues, miraculously gave Bezaleel and Aholiab theskill that was wanting. The honour which comes from God, is alwaysattended with a work to be done; to be employed for God is high honour.Those whom God calls to any service, he will find or make fit for it.The Lord gives different gifts to different persons; let each mind hisproper work, diligently remembering that whatever wisdom any onepossesses, the Lord put it in the heart, to do his commandments.
Exo 31:12-17	<br>Orders were now given that a tabernacle should be set up for theservice of God. But they must not think that the nature of the work,and the haste that was required, would justify them in working at it onsabbath days. The Hebrew word /shabath/ signifies rest, or ceasing fromlabour. The thing signified by the sabbath is that rest in glory whichremains for the people of God; therefore the moral obligation of thesabbath must continue, till time is swallowed up in eternity.<br>Verse 18<br>The law was written in tables of stone, to show how lasting it is: todenote likewise the hardness of our hearts; one might more easily writeon stone, than write any thing good on our corrupt natural hearts. Itwas written with the finger of God; by his will and power. God only canwrite his law in the heart: he gives a heart of flesh; then, by hisSpirit, which is the finger of God, writes his will in the heart, 2Co3:3.
Exo 32:1-6	<br>While Moses was in the mount, receiving the law from God, the peoplemade a tumultuous address to Aaron. This giddy multitude were weary ofwaiting for the return of Moses. Weariness in waiting betrays to manytemptations. The Lord must be waited for till he comes, and waited forthough he tarry. Let their readiness to part with their ear-rings tomake an idol, shame our niggardliness in the service of the true God.They did not draw back on account of the cost of their idolatry; andshall we grudge the expenses of religion? Aaron produced the shape ofan ox or calf, giving it some finish with a graving tool. They offeredsacrifice to this idol. Having set up an image before them, and sochanged the truth of God into a lie, their sacrifices were abomination.Had they not, only a few days before, in this very place, heard thevoice of the Lord God speaking to them out of the midst of the fire,Thou shalt not make to thyself any graven image? Had they notthemselves solemnly entered into covenant with God, that they would doall he had said to them, and would be obedient? ch. 24:7. Yet beforethey stirred from the place where this covenant had been solemnly made,they brake an express command, in defiance of an express threatening.It plainly shows, that the law was no more able to make holy, than itwas to justify; by it is the knowledge of sin, but not the cure of sin.Aaron was set apart by the Divine appointment to the office of thepriesthood; but he, who had once shamed himself so far as to build analtar to a golden calf, must own himself unworthy of the honour ofattending at the altar of God, and indebted to free grace alone for it.Thus pride and boasting were silenced.
Exo 32:7-14	<br>God says to Moses, that the Israelites had corrupted themselves. Sin isthe corruption of the sinner, and it is a self-corruption; every man istempted when he is drawn aside of his own lust. They had turned asideout of the way. Sin is a departing from the way of duty into a by-path.They soon forgot God's works. He sees what they cannot discover, nor isany wickedness of the world hid from him. We could not bear to see thethousandth part of that evil which God sees every day. God expressesthe greatness of his just displeasure, after the manner of men whowould have prayer of Moses could save them from ruin; thus he was atype of Christ, by whose mediation alone, God would reconcile the worldto himself. Moses pleads God's glory. The glorifying God's name, as itought to be our first petition, and it is so in the Lord's prayer, soit ought to be our great plea. And God's promises are to be our pleasin prayer; for what he has promised he is able to perform. See thepower of prayer. In answer to the prayers of Moses, God showed hispurpose of sparing the people, as he had before seemed determined ontheir destruction; which change of the outward discovery of hispurpose, is called repenting of the evil.
Exo 32:15-20	<br>What a change it is, to come down from the mount of communion with God,to converse with a wicked world. In God we see nothing but what is pureand pleasing; in the world nothing but what is sinful and provoking.That it might appear an idol is nothing in the world, Moses ground thecalf to dust. Mixing this powder with their drink, signified that thebackslider in heart should be filled with his own ways.
Exo 32:21-29	<br>Never did any wise man make a more frivolous and foolish excuse thanthat of Aaron. We must never be drawn into sin by any thing man can sayor do to us; for men can but tempt us to sin, they cannot force us. Theapproach of Moses turned the dancing into trembling. They were exposedto shame by their sin. The course Moses took to roll away thisreproach, was, not by concealing the sin, or putting any false colourupon it, but by punishing it. The Levites were to slay the ringleadersin this wickedness; yet none were executed but those who openly stoodforth. Those are marked for ruin who persist in sin: those who in themorning were shouting and dancing, before night were dying. Such suddenchanges do the judgments of the Lord sometimes make with sinners thatare secure and jovial in their sin.
Exo 32:30-35	<br>Moses calls it a great sin. The work of ministers is to show people thegreatness of their sins. The great evil of sin appears in the price ofpardon. Moses pleads with God for mercy; he came not to make excuses,but to make atonement. We are not to suppose that Moses means that hewould be willing to perish for ever, for the people's sake. We are tolove our neighbour as ourselves, and not more than ourselves. Buthaving that mind which was in Christ, he was willing to lay down hislife in the most painful manner, if he might thereby preserve thepeople. Moses could not wholly turn away the wrath of God; which showsthat the law of Moses was not able to reconcile men to God, and toperfect our peace with him. In Christ alone, God so pardons sin as toremember it no more. From this history we see, that no unhumbled,carnal heart, can long endure the holy precepts, the humbling truths,and the spiritual worship of God. But a god, a priest, a worship, adoctrine, and a sacrifice, suited to the carnal mind, will ever meetwith abundance of worshippers. The very gospel itself may be soperverted as to suit a worldly taste. Well is it for us, that theProphet like unto Moses, but who is beyond compare more powerful andmerciful, has made atonement for our souls, and now intercedes in ourbehalf. Let us rejoice in his grace.
Exo 33:1-6	<br>Those whom God pardons, must be made to know what their sin deserved."Let them go forward as they are;" this was very expressive of God'sdispleasure. Though he promises to make good his covenant with Abraham,in giving them Canaan, yet he denies them the tokens of his presencethey had been blessed with. The people mourned for their sin. Of allthe bitter fruits and consequences of sin, true penitents most lament,and dread most, God's departure from them. Canaan itself would be nopleasant land without the Lord's presence. Those who parted withornaments to maintain sin, could do no less than lay aside ornaments,in token of sorrow and shame for it.
Exo 33:7-11	<br>Moses took the tabernacle, and pitched it without the camp. This seemsto have been a temporary building, set up for worship, and at which hejudged disputes among the people. The people looked after him; theywere very desirous to be at peace with God, and concerned to know whatwould come to pass. The cloudy pillar which had withdrawn from the campwhen it was polluted with idolatry, now returned. If our hearts goforth toward God to meet him, he will graciously come to meet us.
Exo 33:12-23	<br>Moses is very earnest with God. Thus, by the intercession of Christ, weare not only saved from ruin, but become entitled to everlastinghappiness. Observe here how he pleads. We find grace in God's sight, ifwe find grace in our hearts to guide and quicken us in the way of ourduty. Moses speaks as one who dreaded the thought of going forwardwithout the Lord's presence. God's gracious promises, and mercy towardsus, should not only encourage our faith, but also excite our fervencyin prayer. Observe how he speeds. See, in a type, Christ'sintercession, which he ever lives to make for all that come to God byhim; and that it is not by any thing in those for whom he intercedes.Moses then entreats a sight of God's glory, and is heard in that also.A full discovery of the glory of God, would overwhelm even Moseshimself. Man is mean, and unworthy of it; weak, and could not bear it;guilty, and could not but dread it. The merciful display which is madein Christ Jesus, alone can be borne by us. The Lord granted that whichwould abundantly satisfy. God's goodness is his glory; and he will haveus to know him by the glory of his mercy, more than by the glory of hismajesty. Upon the rock there was a fit place for Moses to view thegoodness and glory of God. The rock in Horeb was typical of Christ theRock; the Rock of refuge, salvation, and strength. Happy are they whostand upon this Rock. The cleft may be an emblem of Christ, as smitten,crucified, wounded, and slain. What follows, denotes the imperfectknowledge of God in the present state, even as revealed in Christ; forthis, when compared with the heavenly sight of him. is but like seeinga man that is gone by, whose back only is to be seen. God in Christ, ashe is, even the fullest and brightest displays of his glory, grace, andgoodness, are reserved to another state.
Exo 34:1-4	<br>When God made man in his own image, the moral law was written in hisheart, by the finger of God, without outward means. But since thecovenant then made with man was broken, the Lord has used the ministryof men, both in writing the law in the Scriptures, and in writing it inthe heart. When God was reconciled to the Israelites, he ordered thetables to be renewed, and wrote his law in them. Even under the gospelof peace by Christ, the moral law continues to bind believers. ThoughChrist has redeemed us from the curse of the law, yet not from thecommands of it. The first and the best evidence of the pardon of sin,and peace with God, is the writing the law in the heart.
Exo 34:5-9	<br>The Lord descended by some open token of his presence and manifestationof his glory in a cloud, and thence proclaimed his NAME; that is, theperfections and character which are denoted by the name JEHOVAH. TheLord God is merciful; ready to forgive the sinner, and to relieve theneedy. Gracious; kind, and ready to bestow undeserved benefits.Long-suffering; slow to anger, giving time for repentance, onlypunishing when it is needful. He is abundant in goodness and truth;even sinners receive the riches of his bounty abundantly, though theyabuse them. All he reveals is infallible truth, all he promises is infaithfulness. Keeping mercy for thousands; he continually shows mercyto sinners, and has treasures, which cannot be exhausted, to the end oftime. Forgiving iniquity, and transgression, and sin; his mercy andgoodness reach to the full and free forgiveness of sin. And will by nomeans clear the guilty; the holiness and justice of God are part of hisgoodness and love towards all his creatures. In Christ's sufferings,the Divine holiness and justice are fully shown, and the evil of sin ismade known. God's forgiving mercy is always attended by his converting,sanctifying grace. None are pardoned but those who repent and forsakethe allowed practice of every sin; nor shall any escape, who abuse,neglect, or despise this great salvation. Moses bowed down, andworshipped reverently. Every perfection in the name of God, thebeliever may plead with Him for the forgiveness of his sins, the makingholy of his heart, and the enlargement of the Redeemer's kingdom.
Exo 34:10-17	<br>The Israelites are commanded to destroy every monument of idolatry,however curious or costly; to refuse all alliance, friendship, ormarriage with idolaters, and all idolatrous feasts; and they werereminded not with idolaters, and all idolatrous feats; and they werereminded not to repeat the crime of making molten images. Jealously iscalled the rage of a man, Pr 6:34; but in God it is holy and justdispleasure. Those cannot worship God aright, who do not worship himonly.
Exo 34:18-27	<br>Once a week they must rest, even in ploughing time, and in harvest. Allworldly business must give way to that holy rest; even harvest workwill prosper the better, for the religious observance of the sabbathday in harvest time. We must show that we prefer our communion withGod, and our duty to him, before the business or the joy of harvest.Thrice a year they must appear before the Lord God, the God of Israel.Canaan was a desirable land, and the neighbouring nations were greedy;yet God says, They shall not desire it. Let us check all sinful desiresagainst God and his glory, in our hearts, and then trust him to checkall sinful desires in the hearts of others against us. The way of dutyis the way of safety. Those who venture for him never lose by him.Three feasts are here mentioned: 1. The Passover, in remembrance of thedeliverance out of Egypt. 2. The feast of weeks, or the feast ofPentecost; added to it is the law of the first-fruits. 3. The feast ofin-gathering, or the feast of Tabernacles. Moses is to write thesewords, that the people might know them better. We can never be enoughthankful to God for the written word. God would make a covenant withIsrael, in Moses as a mediator. Thus the covenant of grace is made withbelievers through Christ.
Exo 34:28-35	<br>Near and spiritual communion with God improves the graces of a renewedand holy character. Serious godliness puts a lustre upon a man'scountenance, such as commands esteem and affection. The vail whichMoses put on, marked the obscurity of that dispensation, compared withthe gospel dispensation of the New Testament. It was also an emblem ofthe natural vail on the hearts of men respecting spiritual things. Alsothe vail that was and is upon the nation of Israel, which can only betaken away by the Spirit of the Lord showing to them Christ, as the endof the law for righteousness to every one that believeth. Fear andunbelief would put the vail before us, they would hinder our freeapproach to the mercy-seat above. We should spread our wants, temporaland spiritual, fully before our heavenly Father; we should tell him ourhinderances, struggles, trails, and temptations; we should acknowledgeour offences.
Exo 35:1-3	<br>The mild and easy yoke of Christ has made our sabbath duties moredelightful, and our sabbath restraints less irksome, than those of theJews; but we are the more guilty by neglecting them. Surely God'swisdom in giving us the sabbath, with all the mercy of its purposes,are sinfully disregarded. Is it nothing to pour contempt upon theblessed day, which a bounteous God has given to us for our growth ingrace with the church below, and to prepare us for happiness with thechurch above?
Exo 35:4-19	<br>The tabernacle was to be dedicated to the honour of God, and used inhis service; and therefore what was brought for it, was an offering tothe Lord. The rule is, Whosoever is of a willing heart, let him bring.All that were skilful must work. God dispenses his gifts; and as everyman hath received, so he must minister, 1Pe 4:10. Those that were rich,must bring in materials to work on; those that were skilful, must servethe tabernacle with their skill: as they needed one another, so thetabernacle needed them both, 1Co 12:7-21.
Exo 35:20-29	<br>Without a willing mind, costly offerings would be abhorred; with it,the smallest will be accepted. Our hearts are willing, when wecheerfully assist in promoting the cause of God. Those who are diligentand contented in employments considered mean, are as much accepted ofGod as those engaged in splendid services. The women who spun thegoats' hair were wise-hearted, because they did it heartily to theLord. Thus the labourer, mechanic, or servant who attends to his workin the faith and fear of God, may be as wise, for his place, as themost useful minister, and he equally accepted of the Lord. Our wisdomand duty consist in giving God the glory and use of our talents, bethey many or few.
Exo 35:30-35	<br>Here is the Divine appointment of the master-workmen, that there mightbe no strife for the office, and that all who were employed in the workmight take direction from, and give account to them. Those whom Godcalled by name to his service, he filled with the Spirit of God. Skill,even in worldly employments, is God's gift, and comes from above. Butmany are ready enough in cutting out work for other people, and cantell what this man or that man should do; but the burdens they bind onothers, they themselves will not touch with one of their fingers. Suchwill fall under the character of slothful servants. These men were notonly to devise and to work themselves, but they were to teach others.Those that rule should teach; and those to whom God has givenknowledge, should be willing to make it known for the benefit ofothers.
Exo 38:1-8	<br>In all ages of the church there have been some persons more devoted toGod, more constant in their attendance upon his ordinances, and morewilling to part even with lawful things, for his sake, than others.Some women, devoted to God and zealous for the tabernacle worship,expressed zeal by parting with their mirrors, which were polishedplates of brass. Before the invention of looking-glasses, these servedthe same purposes. (Ex 38:9-20)
Exo 38:9-20	<br>The walls of the court being of curtains only, intimated that the stateof the Jewish church itself was movable and changeable; and in due timeto be taken down and folded up, when the place of the tent should beenlarged, and its cords lengthened, to make room for the Gentile world.
Exo 38:21-31	<br>The foundation of massy pieces of silver showed the solidity and purityof the truth upon which the church is founded. Let us regard the LordJesus Christ while reading of the furniture of the tabernacle. Whilelooking at the altar of burnt-offering, let us see Jesus. In him, hisrighteousness, and salvation, is a full and sufficient offering forsin. In the laver of regeneration, by his Holy Spirit, let our souls bewashed, and they shall be clean; and as the people offered willingly,so may our souls be made willing. Let us be ready to part with anything, and count all but loss to win Christ.
Exo 39:1-31	<br>The priests' garments were rich and splendid. The church in its infancywas thus taught by shadows of good things to come; but the substance isChrist, and the grace of the gospel. Christ is our great High Priest.When he undertook the work of our redemption, he put on the clothes ofservice, he arrayed himself with the gifts and graces of the Spirit,girded himself with resolution to go through the undertaking, tookcharge of all God's spiritual Israel, laid them near his heart,engraved them on the palms of his hands, and presented them to hisFather. And he crowned himself with holiness to the Lord, consecratinghis whole undertaking to the honour of his Father's holiness. Truebelievers are spiritual priests. The clean linen with which all theirclothes of service must be made, is the righteousness of saints, Re19:8.
Exo 39:32-43	<br>The tabernacle was a type or emblem of Jesus Christ. As the Most Highdwelt visibly within the sanctuary, even on the ark, so did he residein the human nature and tabernacle of his dear Son; in Christ dwelt allthe fulness of the Godhead bodily, Col 2:9. The tabernacle was a symbolof every real Christian. In the soul of every true follower of theSaviour the Father dwells, the object of his worship, and the author ofhis blessings. The tabernacle also typified the church of the Redeemer.The meanest and the mightiest are alike dear to the Father's love,freely exercised through faith in Christ. The tabernacle was a type andemblem of the heavenly temple, Re 21:3. What, then, will be thesplendour of His appearance, when the cloud shall be withdrawn, and hisfaithful worshippers shall see him as he is!
Exo 40:1-15	<br>When a new year begins, we should seek to serve God better than theyear before. In half a year the tabernacle was completed. When thehearts of numbers are earnest in a good cause, much may be done in ashort time; and when the commandments of God are continually attendedto, as the rule of working, all will be done well. The high-priesthoodwas in the family of Aaron till Christ came, and in Him, the substanceof all these shadows, it continues for ever.
Exo 40:16-33	<br>When the tabernacle and the furniture of it were prepared, they did notput off rearing it till they came to Canaan; but, in obedience to thewill of God, they set it up in the midst of their camp. Those who areunsettled in the world, must not think that this will excuse want ofreligion; as if it were enough to begin to serve God when they begin tobe settled in the world. No; a tabernacle for God is very needful, evenin a wilderness, especially as we may be in another world before wecome to fix in this. And we may justly fear lest we should deceiveourselves with a form of godliness. The thought that so few enteredCanaan, should warn young persons especially, not to put off the careof their souls.
Exo 40:34-38	<br>The cloud covered the tabernacle even in the clearest day; it was not acloud which the sun scatters. This cloud was a token of God's presenceto be seen day and night, by all Israel, that they might never againquestion, Is the Lord among us, or is he not? It guided the camp ofIsrael through the wilderness. While the cloud rested on thetabernacle, they rested; when it removed, they followed it. The gloryof the Lord filled the tabernacle. In light and fire the Shechinah madeitself visible: God is Light; our God is a consuming Fire. Yet sodazzling was the light, and so dreadful the fire, that Moses was notable to enter into the tent of the congregation, till the splendour wasabated. But what Moses could not do, our Lord Jesus has done, whom Godcaused to draw near; and who has invited us to come boldly, even to themercy-seat. Being taught by the Holy Spirit to follow the example ofChrist, as well as to depend upon him, to attend his ordinances, andobey his precepts, we shall be kept from losing our way, and be led inthe midst of the paths of judgment, till we come to heaven, thehabitation of his holiness. BLESSED BE GOD FOR JESUS CHRIST!
Lev 1:1,2	<br>The offering of sacrifices was an ordinance of true religion, from thefall of man unto the coming of Christ. But till the Israelites were inthe wilderness, no very particular regulations seem to have beenappointed. The general design of these laws is plain. The sacrificestypified Christ; they also shadowed out the believer's duty, character,privilege, and communion with God. There is scarcely any thing spokenof the Lord Jesus in Scripture which has not also a reference to hispeople. This book begins with the laws concerning sacrifices; the mostancient were the burnt-offerings, about which God here gives Mosesdirections. It is taken for granted that the people would be willing tobring offerings to the Lord. The very light of nature directs man, someway or other, to do honour to his Maker, as his Lord. Immediately afterthe fall, sacrifices were ordained.
Lev 1:3-9	<br>In the due performance of the Levitical ordinances, the mysteries ofthe spiritual world are represented by corresponding natural objects;and future events are exhibited in these rites. Without this, the wholewill seem unmeaning ceremonies. There is in these things a type of thesufferings of the Son of God, who was to be a sacrifice for the sins ofthe whole world? The burning body of an animal was but a faintrepresentation of that everlasting misery, which we all have deserved;and which our blessed Lord bore in his body and in his soul, when hedied under the load of our iniquities. Observe, 1. The beast to beoffered must be without blemish. This signified the strength and puritythat were in Christ, and the holy life that should be in his people. 2.The owner must offer it of his own free will. What is done in religion,so as to please God, must be done by love. Christ willingly offeredhimself for us. 3. It must be offered at the door of the tabernacle,where the brazen altar of burnt-offerings stood, which sanctified thegift: he must offer it at the door, as one unworthy to enter, andacknowledging that a sinner can have no communion with God, but bysacrifice. 4. The offerer must put his hand upon the head of hisoffering, signifying thereby, his desire and hope that it might beaccepted from him, to make atonement for him. 5. The sacrifice was tobe killed before the Lord, in an orderly manner, and to honour God. Itsignified also, that in Christians the flesh must be crucified with itscorrupt affections and lust. 6. The priests were to sprinkle the bloodupon the altar; for the blood being the life, that was it which madeatonement. This signified the pacifying and purifying of ourconsciences, by the sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ upon themby faith. 7. The beast was to be divided into several pieces, and thento be burned upon the altar. The burning of the sacrifice signified thesharp sufferings of Christ, and the devout affections with which, as aholy fire, Christians must offer up themselves, their whole spirit,soul, and body, unto God. 8. This is said to be an offering of a sweetsavour. As an act of obedience to a Divine command, and a type ofChrist, this was well-pleasing to God; and the spiritual sacrifices ofChristians are acceptable to God, through Christ, 1Pe 2:5.
Lev 1:10-17	<br>Those who could not offer a bullock, were to bring a sheep or a goat;and those who were not able to do that, were accepted of God, if theybrought a turtle-dove, or a pigeon. Those creatures were chosen forsacrifice which were mild, and gentle, and harmless; to show theinnocence and meekness that were in Christ, and that should be inChristians. The offering of the poor was as typical of Christ'satonement as the more costly sacrifices, and expressed as fullyrepentance, faith, and devotedness to God. We have no excuse, if werefuse the pleasant and reasonable service now required. But we can nomore offer the sacrifice of a broken heart, or of praise andthanksgiving, than an Israelite could offer a bullock or a goat, exceptas God hath first given to us. The more we do in the Lord's service,the greater are our obligations to him, for the will, for the ability,and opportunity. In many things God leaves us to fix what shall bespent in his service, whether of our time or our substance; yet whereGod's providence has put much into a man's power, scanty offerings willnot be accepted, for they are not proper expressions of a willing mind.Let us be devoted in body and soul to his service, whatever he may callus to give, venture, do, or suffer for his sake.
Lev 2:1-11	<br>Meat-offerings may typify Christ, as presented to God for us, and asbeing the Bread of life to our souls; but they rather seem to denoteour obligation to God for the blessings of providence, and those goodworks which are acceptable to God. The term "meat" was, and still is,properly given to any kind of provision, and the greater part of thisoffering was to be eaten for food, not burned. These meat-offerings arementioned after the burnt-offerings: without an interest in thesacrifice of Christ, and devotedness of heart to God, such servicescannot be accepted. Leaven is the emblem of pride, malice, andhypocrisy, and honey of sensual pleasure. The former are directlyopposed to the graces of humility, love, and sincerity, which Godapproves; the latter takes men from the exercises of devotion, and thepractice of good works. Christ, in his character and sacrifice, waswholly free from the things denoted by leaven; and his suffering lifeand agonizing death were the very opposites to worldly pleasure. Hispeople are called to follow, and to be like him.
Lev 2:12-16	<br>Salt is required in all the offerings. God hereby intimates to themthat their sacrifices, in themselves, were unsavoury. All religiousservices must be seasoned with grace. Christianity is the salt of theearth. Directions are given about offering their first-fruits atharvest. If a man, with a thankful sense of God's goodness in givinghim a plentiful crop, was disposed to present an offering to God, lethim bring the first ripe and full ears. Whatever was brought to Godmust be the best in its kind, though it were but green ears of corn.Oil and frankincense must be put upon it. Wisdom and humility softenand sweeten the spirits and services of young people, and their greenears of corn shall be acceptable. God takes delight in the first ripefruits of the Spirit, and the expressions of early piety and devotion.Holy love to God is the fire by which all our offerings must be made.The frankincense denotes the mediation and intercession of Christ, bywhich our services are accepted. Blessed be God that we have thesubstance, of which these observances were but shadows. There is thatexcellency in Christ, and in his work as Mediator, which no types andshadows can fully represent. And our dependence thereon must be soentire, that we must never lose sight of it in any thing we do, if wewould be accepted of God.
Lev 3:1-5	<br>The peace-offerings had regard to God as the giver of all good things.These were divided between the altar, the priest, and the owner. Theywere called peace-offering, because in them God and his people did, asit were, feast together, in token of friendship. The peace-offeringswere offered by way of supplication. If a man were in pursuit of anymercy, he would add a peace-offering to his prayer for it. Christ isour Peace, our Peace-offering; for through him alone it is that we canobtain an answer of peace to our prayers. Or, the peace-offering wasoffered by way of thanksgiving for some mercy received. We must offerto God the sacrifice of praise continually, by Christ our Peace; andthen this shall please the Lord better than an ox or bullock.
Lev 3:6-17	<br>Here is a law that they should eat neither fat nor blood. As for thefat, it means the fat of the inwards, the suet. The blood was forbiddenfor the same reason; because it was God's part of every sacrifice. Godwould not permit the blood that made atonement to be used as a commonthing, Heb 10:29; nor will he allow us, though we have the comfort ofthe atonement made, to claim for ourselves any share in the honour ofmaking it. This taught the Jews to observe distinction between commonand sacred things; it kept them separate from idolaters. It wouldimpress them more deeply with the belief of some important mystery inthe shedding of the blood and the burning the fat of their solemnsacrifices. Christ, as the Prince of peace, "made peace with the bloodof his cross." Through him the believer is reconciled to God; andhaving the peace of God in his heart, he is disposed to follow peacewith all men. May the Lord multiply grace, mercy, and peace, to all whodesire to bear the Christian character.
Lev 4:1-12	<br>Burnt-offerings, meat-offerings, and peace-offerings, had been offeredbefore the giving of the law upon mount Sinai; and in these thepatriarchs had respect to sin, to make atonement for it. But the Jewswere now put into a way of making atonement for sin, more particularlyby sacrifice, as a shadow of good things to come; yet the substance isChrist, and that one offering of himself, by which he put away sin. Thesins for which the sin-offerings were appointed are supposed to be openacts. They are supposed to be sins of commission, things which oughtnot to have been done. Omissions are sins, and must come into judgment:yet what had been omitted at one time, might be done at another; but asin committed was past recall. They are supposed to be sins committedthrough ignorance. The law begins with the case of the anointed priest.It is evident that God never had any infallible priest in his churchupon earth, when even the high priest was liable to fall into sins ofignorance. All pretensions to act without error are sure marks ofAntichrist. The beast was to be carried without the camp, and thereburned to ashes. This was a sign of the duty of repentance, which isthe putting away sin as a detestable thing, which our soul hates. Thesin-offering is called sin. What they did to that, we must do to oursins; the body of sin must be destroyed, Ro 6:6. The apostle appliesthe carrying this sacrifice without the camp to Christ, Heb 13:11-13.
Lev 4:13-21	<br>If the leaders of the people, through mistake, caused them to err, anoffering must be brought, that wrath might not come upon the wholecongregation. When sacrifices were offered, the persons, on whosebehalf they were devoted, were to lay their hands on the heads of thevictims, and to confess their sins. The elders were to do so, when thesacrifices were offered for the whole congregation. The load of sin wassupposed then to be borne by the guiltless animal. When the offering iscompleted, it is said, atonement is made, and the sin shall beforgiven. The saving of churches and kingdoms from ruin, is owing tothe satisfaction and mediation of Christ.
Lev 4:22-26	<br>Those who have power to call others to account, are themselvesaccountable to the Ruler of rulers. The sin of the ruler, committedthrough ignorance, must come to his knowledge, either by the check ofhis own conscience, or by the reproof of his friends; both which eventhe best and greatest, not only should submit to, but be thankful for.That which I see not, teach thou me, and, Show me wherein I have erred,are prayers we should put up to God every day; that if, throughignorance, we fall into sin, we may not through ignorance abide in it.
Lev 4:27-35	<br>Here is the law of the sin-offering for a common person. To be able toplead, when charged with sin, that we did it ignorantly, and throughthe surprise of temptation, will not bring us off, if we have nointerest in that great plea, Christ hath died. The sins of ignorancecommitted by a common person, needed a sacrifice; the greatest are notabove, the meanest are not below Divine justice. None, if offenders,were overlooked. Here rich and poor meet together; they are alikesinners, and welcome to Christ. From all these laws concerning thesin-offerings, we may learn to hate sin, and to watch against it; andto value Christ, the great and true Sin-offering, whose blood cleansesfrom all sin, which it was not possible that the blood of bulls and ofgoats should take away. For us to err, with the Bible in our hands, isthe effect of pride, sloth, and carelessness. We need to use frequentself-examination, with serious study of the Scriptures, and earnestprayer for the convincing influences of God the Holy Spirit; that wemay detect our sins of ignorance, repent, and obtain forgivenessthrough the blood of Christ.
Lev 5:1-13	<br>The offences here noticed are, 1. A man's concealing the truth, when hewas sworn as a witness to speak the truth, the whole truth, and nothingbut the truth. If, in such a case, for fear of offending one that hasbeen his friend, or may be his enemy, a man refuses to give evidence,or gives it but in part, he shall bear his iniquity. And that is aheavy burden, which, if some course be not taken to get it removed,will sink a man to hell. Let all that are called at any time to bewitnesses, think of this law, and be free and open in their evidence,and take heed of prevaricating. An oath of the Lord is a sacred thing,not to be trifled with. 2. A man's touching any thing that wasceremonially unclean. Though his touching the unclean thing only madehim ceremonially defiled, yet neglecting to wash himself according tothe law, was either carelessness or contempt, and contracted moralguilt. As soon as God, by his Spirit, convinces our consciences of anysin or duty, we must follow the conviction, as not ashamed to own ourformer mistake. 3. Rash swearing, that a man will do or not do such athing. As if the performance of his oath afterward prove unlawful, orwhat cannot be done. Wisdom and watchfulness beforehand would preventthese difficulties. In these cases the offender must confess his sin,and bring his offering; but the offering was not accepted, unlessaccompanied with confession and humble prayer for pardon. Theconfession must be particular; that he hath sinned in that thing.Deceit lies in generals; many will own they have sinned, for that allmust own; but their sins in any one particular they are unwilling toallow. The way to be assured of pardon, and armed against sin for thefuture, is to confess the exact truth. If any were very poor, theymight bring some flour, and that should be accepted. Thus the expenseof the sin-offering was brought lower than any other, to teach that noman's poverty shall ever bar the way of his pardon. If the sinnerbrought two doves, one was to be offered for a sin-offering, and theother for a burnt-offering. We must first see that our peace be madewith God, and then we may expect that our services for his glory willbe accepted by him. To show the loathsomeness of sin, the flour, whenoffered, must not be made grateful to the taste by oil, or to the smellby frankincense. God, by these sacrifices, spoke comfort to those whohad offended, that they might not despair, nor pine away in their sins.Likewise caution not to offend any more, remembering how expensive andtroublesome it was to make atonement.
Lev 5:14-19	<br>Here are offerings to atone for trespasses against a neighbour. If aman put to his own use unwittingly, any thing dedicated to God, he wasto bring this sacrifice. We are to be jealous over ourselves, to askpardon for the sin, and make satisfaction for the wrong, which we dobut suspect ourselves guilty of. The law of God is so very broad, theoccasions of sin in this guilty of. The law of God is so very broad,the occasions of sin in this world are so numerous, and we are so proneto evil, that we need to fear always, and to pray always, that we maybe kept from sin. Also we should look before us at every step. The trueChristian daily pleads guilty before God, and seeks forgiveness throughthe blood of Christ. And the gospel salvation is so free, that thepoorest is not shut out; and so full, that the most burdened consciencemay find relief from it. Yet the evil of sin is so displayed as tocause every pardoned sinner to abhor and dread it.
Lev 6:1-7	<br>Though all the instances relate to our neighbour, yet it is called atrespass against the Lord. Though the person injured be mean, and evendespicable, yet the injury reflects upon that God who has made thecommand of loving our neighbour next to that of loving himself. Humanlaws make a difference as to punishments; but all methods of doingwrong to others, are alike violations of the Divine law, even keepingwhat is found, when the owner can be discovered. Frauds are generallyaccompanied with lies, often with false oaths. If the offender wouldescape the vengeance of God, he must make ample restitution, accordingto his power, and seek forgiveness by faith in that one Offering whichtaketh away the sin of the world. The trespasses here mentioned, stillare trespasses against the law of Christ, which insists as much uponjustice and truth, as the law of nature, or the law of Moses.
Lev 6:8-13	<br>The daily sacrifice of a lamb is chiefly referred to. The priest musttake care of the fire upon the altar. The first fire upon the altarcame from heaven, ch. 9:24; by keeping that up continually, all theirsacrifices might be said to be consumed with the fire from heaven, intoken of God's acceptance. Thus should the fire of our holy affections,the exercise of our faith and love, of prayer and praise, be withoutceasing.
Lev 6:14-23	<br>The law of the burnt-offerings put upon the priests a great deal ofcare and work; the flesh was wholly burnt, and the priests had nothingbut the skin. But most of the meat-offering was their own. It is God'swill that his ministers should be provided with what is needful.
Lev 6:24-30	<br>The blood of the sin-offering was to be washed out of the clothes onwhich it should happen to be sprinkled, which signified the regard weought to have to the blood of Christ, not counting it a common thing.The vessel in which the flesh of the sin-offering was boiled must bebroken, if it were an earthen one; but if a brazen one, well washed.This showed that the defilement was not wholly taken away by theoffering; but the blood of Christ thoroughly cleanses from all sin. Allthese rules set forth the polluting nature of sin, and the removal ofguilt from the sinner to the sacrifice. Behold and wonder at Christ'slove, in that he was content to be made a sin-offering for us, and soto procure our pardon for continual sins and failings. He that knew nosin was made sin (that is, a sin-offering) for us, 2Co 5:21. Hence wehave pardon, and not only pardon, but power also, against sin, Ro 8:3.
Lev 7:1-10	<br>In the sin-offering and the trespass-offering, the sacrifice wasdivided between the altar and the priest; the offerer had no share, ashe had in the peace-offerings. The former expressed repentance andsorrow for sin, therefore it was more proper to fast than feast; thepeace-offerings denoted communion with a reconciled God in Christ, thejoy and gratitude of a pardoned sinner, and the privileges of a truebeliever.
Lev 7:11-27	<br>As to the peace-offerings, in the expression of their sense of mercy,God left them more at liberty, than in the expression of their sense ofsin; that their sacrifices, being free-will offerings, might be themore acceptable, while, by obliging them to bring the sacrifices ofatonement, God shows the necessity of the great Propitiation. The mainreason why blood was forbidden of old, was because the Lord hadappointed blood for an atonement. This use, being figurative, had itsend in Christ, who by his death and blood-shedding caused thesacrifices to cease. Therefore this law is not now in force onbelievers.
Lev 7:28-34	<br>The priest who offered, was to have the breast and the right shoulder.When the sacrifice was killed, the offerer himself must present God'spart of it; that he might signify his cheerfully giving it up to God.He was with his own hands to lift it up, in token of his regard to Godas the God of heaven; and then to wave it to and fro, in token of hisregard to God as the Lord of the whole earth. Be persuaded andencouraged to feed and feast upon Christ, our Peace-offering. Thisblessed Peace-offering is not for the priests only, for saints of thehighest rank and greatest eminence, but for the common people also.Take heed of delay. Many think to repent and return to God when theyare dying and dropping into hell; but they should eat thepeace-offering, and eat it now. Stay not till the day of the Lord'spatience be run out, for eating the third day will not be accepted, norwill catching at Christ when thou art gone to hell! (Le 7:35-38)
Lev 7:35-38	<br>Solemn acts of religious worship are not things which we may do or notdo at our pleasure; it is at our peril if we omit them. An observanceof the laws of Christ cannot be less necessary than of the laws ofMoses.
Lev 8:1-13	<br>The consecration of Aaron and his sons had been delayed until thetabernacle had been prepared, and the laws of the sacrifices given.Aaron and his sons were washed with water, to signify that they oughtto purify themselves from all sinful dispositions, and ever after tokeep themselves pure. Christ washes those from their sins in his ownblood whom he makes kings and priests to our God, Re 1:5,6; and thosethat draw near to God must be washed in pure water, Heb 10:22. Theanointing of Aaron was to typify the anointing of Christ with theSpirit, which was not given by measure to him. All believers havereceived the anointing.
Lev 8:14-36	<br>In these types we see our great High Priest, even Christ Jesus,solemnly appointed, anointed, and invested with his sacred office, byhis own blood, and the influences of his Holy Spirit. He sanctifies theordinances of religion, to the benefit of his people and the honour ofGod the Father; who for his sake accepts our worship, though it ispolluted with sin. We may also rejoice, that he is a merciful andfaithful High Priest, full of compassion to the feeble-minded andtempest-tossed soul. All true Christians are consecrated to bespiritual priests. We should seriously ask ourselves, whether in ourdaily walk we study to maintain this character? and abound in spiritualsacrifices, acceptable to God through Christ? If so, still there is nocause for boasting. Let us not despise our fellow-sinners; butremembering what we have done, and how we are saved, let us seek andpray for their salvation.
Lev 9:1-21	<br>These many sacrifices, which were all done away by the death of Christ,teach us that our best services need washing in his blood, and that theguilt of our best sacrifices needs to be done away by one more pure andmore noble than they. Let us be thankful that we have such a HighPriest. The priests had not a day's respite from service allowed. God'sspiritual priests have constant work, which the duty of every dayrequires; they that would give up their account with joy, must redeemtime. The glory of God appeared in the sight of the people, and ownedwhat they had done. We are not now to expect such appearances, but Goddraws nigh to those who draw nigh to him, and the offerings of faithare acceptable to him; though the sacrifices being spiritual, thetokens of the acceptance are spiritual likewise. When Aaron had doneall that was to be done about the sacrifices, he lifted up his handstowards the people, and blessed them. Aaron could but crave a blessing,God alone can command it.
Lev 9:22-24	<br>When the solemnity was finished, and the blessing pronounced, Godtestified his acceptance. There came a fire out from before the Lord,and consumed the sacrifice. This fire might justly have fastened uponthe people, and have consumed them for their sins; but its consumingthe sacrifice signified God's acceptance of it, as an atonement for thesinner. This also was a figure of good things to come. The Spiritdescended upon the apostles in fire. And the descent of this holy fireinto our souls, to kindle in them pious and devout affections towardGod, and such a holy zeal as burns up the flesh and the lusts of it, isa certain token of God's gracious acceptance of our persons andperformances. Nothing goes to God, but what comes from him. We musthave grace, that holy fire, from the God of grace, else we cannot servehim acceptably, Heb 12:28. The people were affected with this discoveryof God's glory and grace. They received it with the highest joy;triumphing in the assurance given them that they had God nigh untothem. And with the lowest reverence; humbly adoring the majesty of thatGod, who vouchsafed thus to manifest himself to them. That is a sinfulfear of God, which drives us from him; a gracious fear makes us bowbefore him.
Lev 10:1,2	<br>Next to Moses and Aaron, none were more likely to be honourable inIsrael than Nadab and Abihu. There is reason to think that they werepuffed up with pride, and that they were heated with wine. While thepeople were prostrate before the Lord, adoring his presence and glory,they rushed into the tabernacle to burn incense, though not at theappointed time; both together, instead of one alone, and with fire nottaken from the altar. If it had been done through ignorance, they hadbeen allowed to bring a sin-offering. But the soul that doethpresumptuously, and in contempt of God's majesty and justice, that soulshall be cut off. The wages of sin is death. They died in the very actof their sin. The sin and punishment of these priests showed theimperfection of that priesthood from the very beginning, and that itcould not shelter any from the fire of God's wrath, otherwise than asit was typical of Christ's priesthood.
Lev 10:3-7	<br>The most quieting considerations under affliction are fetched from theword of God. What was it that God spake? Though Aaron's heart must havebeen filled with anguish and dismay, yet with silent submission herevered the justice of the stroke. When God corrects us or ours forsin, it is our duty to accept the punishment, and say, It is the Lord,let him do what seemeth him good. Whenever we worship God, we come nighunto him, as spiritual priests. This ought to make us very serious inall acts of devotion. It concerns us all, when we come nigh to God, todo every religious exercise, as those who believe that the God withwhom we have to do, is a holy God. He will take vengeance on those thatprofane his sacred name by trifling with him.
Lev 10:8-11	<br>Do not drink wine or strong drink. During the time they ministered, thepriests were forbidden it. It is required of gospel ministers, thatthey be not given to wine, 1Ti 3:3. It is, Lest ye die; die when ye arein drink. The danger of death, to which we are continually exposed,should engage all to be sober.
Lev 10:12-20	<br>Afflictions should rather quicken us to our duty, than take us from it.But our unfitness for duty, when it is natural and not sinful, willhave great allowances made for it; God will have mercy, and notsacrifice. Let us profit by the solemn warning this history conveys.When professing worshippers come with zeal without knowledge, carnalaffections, earthly, light, vain, trifling thoughts, the devices ofwill-worship, instead of the offering of soul and spirit; then theincense is kindled by a flame which never came down from heaven, whichthe Spirit of a holy God never sent within their hearts.
Lev 13:1-17	<br>The plague of leprosy was an uncleanness, rather than a disease. Christis said to cleanse lepers, not to cure them. Common as the leprosy wasamong the Hebrews, during and after their residence in Egypt, we haveno reason to believe that it was known among them before. Theirdistressed state and employment in that land must have rendered themliable to disease. But it was a plague often inflicted immediately bythe hand of God. Miriam's leprosy, and Gehazi's, and king Uzziah's,were punishments of particular sins; no marvel there was care taken todistinguish it from a common distemper. The judgment of it was referredto the priests. And it was a figure of the moral pollutions of men'sminds by sin, which is the leprosy of the soul, defiling to theconscience, and from which Christ alone can cleanse. The priest couldonly convict the leper, (by the law is the knowledge of sin,) butChrist can cure the sinner, he can take away sin. It is a work of greatimportance, but of great difficulty, to judge of our spiritual state.We all have cause to suspect ourselves, being conscious of sores andspots; but whether clean or unclean is the question. As there werecertain marks by which to know it was leprosy, so there are marks ofsuch as are in the gall of bitterness. The priest must take time inmaking his judgment. This teaches all, both ministers and people, notto be hasty in censures, nor to judge anything before the time. If somemen's sins go before unto judgment, the sins of others follow after,and so do men's good works. If the person suspected were found to beclean, yet he must wash his clothes, because there had been ground forthe suspicion. We have need to be washed in the blood of Christ fromour spots, though not leprosy spots; for who can say, I am pure fromsin?
Lev 13:18-44	<br>The priest is told what judgment to make, if there were any appearanceof a leprosy in old sores; and such is the danger of those who havingescaped the pollutions of the world are again entangled therein. Or, ina burn by accident, 
Lev 13:24	<br>The burning of strife and contentionoften occasions the rising and breaking out of that corruption, whichproves that men are unclean. Human life lies exposed to manygrievances. With what troops of diseases are we beset on every side;and thy all entered by sin! If the constitution be healthy, and thebody lively and easy, we are bound to glorify God with our bodies.Particular note was taken of the leprosy, if in the head. If theleprosy of sin has seized the head; if the judgment be corrupted, andwicked principles, which support wicked practices, are embraced, it isutter uncleanness, from which few are cleansed. Soundness in the faithkeeps leprosy from the head.
Lev 13:45,46	<br>When the priest had pronounced the leper unclean, it put a stop to hisbusiness in the world, cut him off from his friends and relations, andruined all the comfort he could have in the world. He must humblehimself under the mighty hand of God, not insisting upon his cleanness,when the priest had pronounced him unclean, but accepting thepunishment. Thus must we take to ourselves the shame that belongs tous, and with broken hearts call ourselves "Unclean, unclean;" heartunclean, life unclean; unclean by original corruption, unclean byactual transgression; unclean, therefore deserving to be for ever shutout from communion with God, and all hope of happiness in him; unclean,therefore undone, if infinite mercy do not interpose. The leper mustwarn others to take heed of coming near him. He must then be shut outof the camp, and afterward, when they came to Canaan, be shut out ofthe city, town, or village where he lived, and dwell with none butthose that were lepers like himself. This typified the purity whichought to be in the gospel church.
Lev 13:47-59	<br>The garment suspected to be tainted with leprosy was not to be burnedimmediately. If, upon search, it was found that there was a leprousspot, it must be burned, or at least that part of it. If it proved tobe free, it must be washed, and then might be used. This also setsforth the great evil there is in sin. It not only defiles the sinner'sconscience, but it brings a stain upon all he has and all that he does.And those who make their clothes servants to their pride and lust, maysee them thereby tainted with leprosy. But the robes of righteousnessnever fret, nor are moth-eaten.
Lev 14:1-9	<br>The priests could not cleanse the lepers; but when the Lord removed theplague, various rules were to be observed in admitting them again tothe ordinances of God, and the society of his people. They representmany duties and exercises of truly repenting sinners, and the duties ofministers respecting them. If we apply this to the spiritual leprosy ofsin, it intimates that when we withdraw from those who walk disorderly,we must not count them as enemies, but admonish them as brethren. Andalso that when God by his grace has brought to repentance, they oughtwith tenderness and joy, and sincere affection, to be received again.Care should always be taken that sinners may not be encouraged, norpenitents discouraged. If it were found that the leprosy was healed,the priest must declare it with the particular solemnities heredescribed. The two birds, one killed, and the other dipped in the bloodof the bird that was killed, and then let loose, may signify Christshedding his blood for sinners, and rising and ascending into heaven.The priest having pronounced the leper clean from the disease, he mustmake himself clean from all remains of it. Thus those who have comfortof the remission of their sins, must with care and caution cleansethemselves from sins; for every one that has this hope in him, will beconcerned to purify himself.
Lev 14:10-32	<br>The cleansed leper was to be presented to the Lord, with his offerings.When God has restored us to enjoy public worship again, after sickness,distance, or otherwise, we should testify our thanksgiving by ourdiligent use of the liberty. And both we and our offerings must bepresented before the Lord, by the Priest that made us clean, even ourLord Jesus. Beside the usual rites of the trespass-offering, some ofthe blood, and some of the oil, was to be put upon him that was to becleansed. Wherever the blood of Christ is applied for justification,the oil of the Spirit is applied for sanctification; these two cannotbe separated. We have here the gracious provision the law made for poorlepers. The poor are as welcome to God's altar as the rich. But thougha meaner sacrifice was accepted from the poor, yet the same ceremonywas used for the rich; their souls are as precious, and Christ and hisgospel are the same to both. Even for the poor one lamb was necessary.No sinner could be saved, had it not been for the Lamb that was slain,and hath redeemed us to God with his blood.
Lev 14:33-53	<br>The leprosy in a house is unaccountable to us, as well as the leprosyin a garment; but now sin, where that reigns in a house, is a plaguethere, as it is in a heart. Masters of families should be aware, andafraid of the first appearance of sin in their families, and put itaway, whatever it is. If the leprosy is got into the house, theinfected part must be taken out. If it remain in the house, the wholemust be pulled down. The owner had better be without a dwelling, thanlive in one that was infected. The leprosy of sin ruins families andchurches. Thus sin is so interwoven with the human body, that it mustbe taken down by death.
Lev 14:54-57	<br>When that God who is rich in mercy, for his great love wherewith heloved us, even when we were dead in sins, hath quickened us by hisgrace, Eph 2:4,5, we shall manifest the change by repenting, andforsaking former sins. Let us follow after holiness, and let uscompassionate other poor lepers, and desire, seek, and pray for theircleansing.
Lev 16:1-14	<br>Without entering into particulars of the sacrifices on the great day ofatonement, we may notice that it was to be a statute for ever, tillthat dispensation be at an end. As long as we are continually sinning,we continually need the atonement. The law of afflicting our souls forsin, is a statue which will continue in force till we arrive where alltears, even those of repentance, will be wiped from our eyes. Theapostle observes it as a proof that the sacrifices could not take awaysin, and cleanse the conscience from it, that in them there was aremembrance made of sin every year, upon the day of atonement, Heb10:1,3. The repeating the sacrifices, showed there was in them but afeeble effort toward making atonement; this could be done only byoffering up the body of Christ once for all; and that sacrifice needednot to be repeated. (Le 16:15-34)
Lev 16:15-34	<br>Here are typified the two great gospel privileges, of the remission ofsin, and access to God, both of which we owe to our Lord Jesus. See theexpiation of guilt. Christ is both the Maker and the Matter of theatonement; for he is the Priest, the High Priest, that makesreconciliation for the sins of the people. And as Christ is the HighPriest, so he is the Sacrifice with which atonement is made; for he isall in all in our reconciliation to God. Thus he was figured by the twogoats. The slain goat was a type of Christ dying for our sins; thescape-goat a type of Christ rising again for our justification. Theatonement is said to be completed by putting the sins of Israel uponthe head of the goat, which was sent away into a wilderness, a land notinhabited; and the sending away of the goat represented the free andfull remission of their sins. He shall bear upon him all theiriniquities. Thus Christ, the Lamb of God, takes away the sin of theworld, by taking it upon himself, Joh 1:29. The entrance into heaven,which Christ made for us, was typified by the high priest's entranceinto the most holy place. See Heb 9:7. The high priest was to come outagain; but our Lord Jesus ever lives, making intercession, and alwaysappears in the presence of God for us. Here are typified the two greatgospel duties of faith and repentance. By faith we put our hands uponthe head of the offering; relying on Christ as the Lord ourRighteousness, pleading his satisfaction, as that which alone is ableto atone for our sins, and procure us a pardon. By repentance weafflict our souls; not only fasting for a time from the delights of thebody, but inwardly sorrowing for sin, and living a life of self-denial,assuring ourselves, that if we confess our sins, God is faithful andjust to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from allunrighteousness. By the atonement we obtain rest for our souls, and allthe glorious liberties of the children of God. Sinner, get the blood ofChrist effectually applied to thy soul, or else thou canst never lookGod in the face with any comfort or acceptance. Take this blood ofChrist, apply it by faith, and see how it atones with God.
Lev 17:1-9	<br>All the cattle killed by the Israelites, while in the wilderness, wereto be presented before the door of the tabernacle, and the flesh to bereturned to the offerer, to be eaten as a peace-offering, according tothe law. When they entered Canaan, this only continued in respect ofsacrifices. The spiritual sacrifices we are now to offer, are notconfined to any one place. We have now no temple or altar thatsanctifies the gift; nor does the gospel unity rest only in one place,but in one heart, and the unity of the Spirit. Christ is our Altar, andthe true Tabernacle; in him God dwells among men. It is in him that oursacrifices are acceptable to God, and in him only. To set up othermediators, or other altars, or other expiatory sacrifices, is, ineffect, to set up other gods. And though God will graciously accept ourfamily offerings, we must not therefore neglect attending at thetabernacle.
Lev 17:10-16	<br>Here is a confirmation of the law against eating blood. They must eatno blood. But this law was ceremonial, and is now no longer in force;the coming of the substance does away the shadow. The blood of beastsis no longer the ransom, but Christ's blood only; therefore there isnot now the reason for abstaining there then was. The blood is nowallowed for the nourishment of our bodies; it is no longer appointed tomake an atonement for the soul. Now the blood of Christ makes atonementreally and effectually; to that, therefore, we must have regard, andnot consider it as a common thing, or treat it with indifference.
Lev 19:2	<br>To teach real separation fromthe world and the flesh, and entire devotedness to God. This is now thelaw of Christ; may the Lord bring every thought within us intoobedience to it! Children are to be obedient to their parents, 
Lev 19:3	<br>The fear here required includes inward reverence and esteem,outward respect and obedience, care to please them and to make themeasy. God only is to be worshipped, 
Lev 19:4	<br>Turn not from the trueGod to false ones, from the God who will make you holy and happy, tothose that will deceive you, and make you for ever miserable. Turn notyour eyes to them, much less your heart. They should leave thegleanings of their harvest and vintage for the poor, 
Lev 19:9	<br>Worksof piety must be always attended with works of charity, according toour ability. We must not be covetous, griping, and greedy of everything we can lay claim to, nor insist upon our right in all things. Weare to be honest and true in all our dealings, 
Lev 19:11	<br>Whatever wehave in the world, we must see that we get it honestly, for we cannotbe truly rich, or long rich, with that which is not so. Reverence tothe sacred name of God must be shown, 
Lev 19:12	<br>We must not detainwhat belongs to another, particularly the wages of the hireling, 
Lev 19:13	<br>We must be tender of the credit and safety of those that cannothelp themselves, 
Lev 19:14	<br>Do no hurt to any, because they areunwilling or unable to avenge themselves. We ought to take heed ofdoing any thing which may occasion our weak brother to fall. The fearof God should keep us from doing wrong things, though they will notexpose us to men's anger. Judges, and all in authority, are commandedto give judgment without partiality, 
Lev 19:15	<br>To be a tale-bearer,and to sow discord among neighbours, is as bad an office as a man canput himself into. We are to rebuke our neighbour in love, 
Lev 19:17	<br>Rather rebuke him than hate him, for an injury done to thyself. Weincur guilt by not reproving; it is hating our brother. We should say,I will do him the kindness to tell him of his faults. We are to put offall malice, and to put on brotherly love, 
Lev 19:18	<br>We often wrongourselves, but we soon forgive ourselves those wrongs, and they do notat all lessen our love to ourselves; in like manner we should love ourneighbour. We must in many cases deny ourselves for the good of ourneighbour. Ver. #(31): For Christians to have their fortunes told, touse spells and charms, or the like, is a sad affront to God. They mustbe grossly ignorant who ask, "What harm is there in these things?" Hereis a charge to young people to show respect to the aged, 
Lev 19:32	<br>Religion teaches good manners, and obliges us to honour those to whomhonour is due. A charge was given to the Israelites to be very tenderof strangers, 
Lev 19:33	<br>Strangers, and the widows and fatherless, areGod's particular care. It is at our peril, if we do them any wrong.Strangers shall be welcome to God's grace; we should do what we can torecommend religion to them. Justice in weights and measures iscommanded, 
Lev 19:35	<br>We must make conscience of obeying God'sprecepts. We are not to pick and choose our duty, but must aim atstanding complete in all the will of God. And the nearer our lives andtempers are to the precepts of God's law, the happier shall we be, andthe happier shall we make all around us, and the better shall we adornthe gospel.
Lev 20:1-9	<br>Are we shocked at the unnatural cruelty of the ancient idolaters insacrificing their children? We may justly be so. But are there not verymany parents, who, by bad teaching and wicked examples, and by themysteries of iniquity which they show their children, devote them tothe service of Satan, and forward their everlasting ruin, in a mannereven more to be lamented? What an account must such parents render toGod, and what a meeting will they have with their children at the dayof judgment! On the other hand, let children remember that he whocursed father or mother was surely put to death. This law Christconfirmed. Laws which were made before are repeated, and penaltiesannexed to them. If men will not avoid evil practices, because the lawhas made these practices sin, and it is right that we go on thatprinciple, surely they should avoid them when the law has made themdeath, from a principle of self-preservation. In the midst of theselaws comes in a general charge, Sanctify yourselves, and be ye holy. Itis the Lord that sanctifies, and his work will be done, though it bedifficult. Yet his grace is so far from doing away our endeavours, thatit strongly encourages them. Work out your salvation, for it is Godthat worketh in you.
Lev 20:10-27	<br>These verses repeat what had been said before, but it was needful thereshould be line upon line. What praises we owe to God that he has taughtthe evil of sin, and the sure way of deliverance from it! May we havegrace to adorn the doctrine of God our Saviour in all things; may wehave no fellowship with unfruitful works of darkness, but reprove them.
Lev 23:1-3	<br>In this chapter we have the institution of holy times; many of whichhave been mentioned before. Though the yearly feasts were made moreremarkable by general attendance at the sanctuary, yet these must notbe observed more than the sabbath. On that day they must withdraw fromall business of the world. It is a sabbath of rest, typifying spiritualrest from sin, and rest in God. God's sabbaths are to be religiouslyobserved in every private house, by every family apart, as well as byfamilies together, in holy assemblies. The sabbath of the Lord in ourdwellings will be their beauty, strength, and safety; it will sanctify,build up, and glorify them.
Lev 23:4-14	<br>The feast of the Passover was to continue seven days; not idle days,spent in sport, as many that are called Christians spend theirholy-days. Offerings were made to the Lord at his altar; and the peoplewere taught to employ their time in prayer, and praise, and godlymeditation. The sheaf of first-fruits was typical of the Lord Jesus,who is risen from the dead as the First-fruits of them that slept. OurLord Jesus rose from the dead on the very day that the first-fruitswere offered. We are taught by this law to honour the Lord with oursubstance, and with the first-fruits of all our increase, Pr 3:9. Theywere not to eat of their new corn, till God's part was offered to himout of it; and we must always begin with God: begin every day with him,begin every meal with him, begin every affair and business with him;seek first the kingdom of God.
Lev 23:15-22	<br>The feast of Weeks was held in remembrance of the giving of the law,fifty days after the departure from Egypt; and looked forward to theoutpouring of the Holy Ghost, fifty days after Christ our Passover wassacrificed for us. On that day the apostles presented the first-fruitsof the Christian church to God. To the institution of the feast ofPentecost, is added a repetition of that law, by which they wererequired to leave the gleanings of their fields. Those who are trulysensible of the mercy they received from God, will show mercy to thepoor without grudging.
Lev 23:23-32	<br>the blowing of trumpets represented the preaching of the gospel, bywhich men are called to repent of sin, and to accept the salvation ofChrist, which was signified by the day of atonement. Also it invited torejoice in God, and become strangers and pilgrims on earth, which wasdenoted by the feast of Tabernacles, observed in the same month. At thebeginning of the year, they were called by this sound of trumpet toshake off spiritual drowsiness, to search and try their ways, and toamend them. The day of atonement was the ninth day after this; thusthey were awakened to prepare for that day, by sincere and seriousrepentance, that it might indeed be to them a day of atonement. Thehumbling of our souls for sin, and the making our peace with God, iswork that requires the whole man, and the closest application of mind.On that day God spake peace to his people, and to his saints; thereforethey must lay aside all their wordly business, that they might the moreclearly hear that voice of joy and gladness.
Lev 23:33-44	<br>In the feast of Tabernacles there was a remembrance of their dwellingin tents, or booths, in the wilderness, as well as their fathersdwelling in tents in Canaan; to remind them of their origin and theirdeliverance. Christ's tabernacling on earth in human nature, might alsobe prefigured. And it represents the believer's life on earth: astranger and pilgrim here below, his home and heart are above with hisSaviour. They would the more value the comforts and conveniences oftheir own houses, when they had been seven days dwelling in the booths.It is good for those who have ease and plenty, sometimes to learn whatit is to endure hardness. The joy of harvest ought to be improved forthe furtherance of our joy in God. The earth is the Lord's, and thefullness thereof; therefore whatever we have the comfort of, he musthave the glory of, especially when any mercy is perfected. Godappointed these feasts, "Beside the sabbaths and your free-willofferings." Calls to extraordinary services will not excuse fromconstant and stated ones.
Lev 24:1-9	<br>The loaves of bread typify Christ as the Bread of life, and the food ofthe souls of his people. He is the Light of his church, the Light ofthe world; in and through his word this light shines. By this light wediscern the food prepared for our souls; and we should daily, butespecially from sabbath to sabbath, feed thereon in our hearts withthanksgiving. And as the loaves were left in the sanctuary, so shouldwe abide with God till he dismiss us.
Lev 24:10-23	<br>This offender was the son of an Egyptian father, and an Israelitishmother. The notice of his parents shows the common ill effect of mixedmarriages. A standing law for the stoning of blasphemers was made uponthis occasion. Great stress is laid upon this law. It extends to thestrangers among them, as well as to those born in the land. Strangers,as well as native Israelites, should be entitled to the benefit of thelaw, so as not to suffer wrong; and should be liable to the penalty ofthis law, in case they did wrong. If those who profane the name of Godescape punishment from men, yet the Lord our God will not suffer themto escape his righteous judgments. What enmity against God must be inthe heart of man, when blasphemies against God proceed out of hismouth. If he that despised Moses' law, died without mercy, of whatpunishment will they be worthy, who despise and abuse the gospel of theSon of God! Let us watch against anger, do no evil, avoid allconnexions with wicked people, and reverence that holy name whichsinners blaspheme.
Lev 25:1-7	<br>All labour was to cease in the seventh year, as much as daily labour onthe seventh day. These statues tell us to beware of covetousness, for aman's life consists not in the abundance of his possessions. We are toexercise willing dependence on God's providence for our support; toconsider ourselves the Lord's tenants or stewards, and to use ourpossessions accordingly. This year of rest typified the spiritual restwhich all believers enter into through Christ. Through Him we are easedof the burden of wordly care and labour, both being sanctified andsweetened to us; and we are enabled and encouraged to live by faith.
Lev 25:8-22	<br>The word "jubilee" signifies a peculiarly animated sound of the silvertrumpets. This sound was to be made on the evening of the great day ofatonement; for the proclamation of gospel liberty and salvation resultsfrom the sacrifice of the Redeemer. It was provided that the landsshould not be sold away from their families. They could only bedisposed of, as it were, by leases till the year of jubilee, and thenreturned to the owner or his heir. This tended to preserve their tribesand families distinct, till the coming of the Messiah. The libertyevery man was born to, if sold or forfeited, should return at the yearof jubilee. This was typical of redemption by Christ from the slaveryof sin and Satan, and of being brought again to the liberty of thechildren of God. All bargains ought to be made by this rule, "Ye shallnot oppress one another," not take advantage of one another's ignoranceor necessity, "but thou shalt fear thy God." The fear of God reigningin the heart, would restrain from doing wrong to our neighbour in wordor deed. Assurance was given that they should be great gainers, byobserving these years of rest. If we are careful to do our duty, we maytrust God with our comfort. This was a miracle for an encouragement toall neither sowed or reaped. This was a miracle for an encouragement toall God's people, in all ages, to trust him in the way of duty. Thereis nothing lost by faith and self-denial in obedience. Some asked, Whatshall we eat the seventh year? Thus many Christians anticipate evils,questioning what they shall do, and fearing to proceed in the way ofduty. But we have no right to anticipate evils, so as to distressourselves about them. To carnal minds we may appear to act absurdly,but the path of duty is ever the path of safety.
Lev 25:23-34	<br>If the land were not redeemed before the year of jubilee, it thenreturned to him that sold or mortgaged it. This was a figure of thefree grace of God in Christ; by which, and not by any price or merit ofour own, we are restored to the favour of God. Houses in walled citieswere more the fruits of their own industry than land in the country,which was the direct gift of God's bounty; therefore if a man sold ahouse in a city, he might redeem it only within a year after the sale.This encouraged strangers and proselytes to come and settle among them.
Lev 25:35-38	<br>Poverty and decay are great grievances, and very common; the poor yehave always with you. Thou shalt relieve him; by sympathy, pitying thepoor; by service, doing for them; and by supply, giving to themaccording to their necessity, and thine ability. Poor debtors must notbe oppressed. Observe the arguments here used against extortion: "Fearthy God." Relieve the poor, "that they may live with thee;" for theymay be serviceable to thee. The rich can as ill spare the poor, as thepoor can the rich. It becomes those that have received mercy to showmercy.
Lev 25:39-55	<br>A native Israelite, if sold for debt, or for a crime, was to serve butsix years, and to go out the seventh. If he sold himself, throughpoverty, both his work and his usage must be such as were fitting for ason of Abraham. Masters are required to give to their servants thatwhich is just and equal, Col 4:1. At the year of jubilee the servantshould go out free, he and his children, and should return to his ownfamily. This typified redemption from the service of sin and Satan, bythe grace of God in Christ, whose truth makes us free, Joh 8:32. Wecannot ransom our fellow-sinners, but we may point out Christ to them;while by his grace our lives may adorn his gospel, express our love,show our gratitude, and glorify his holy name.
Lev 26:1-13	<br>This chapter contains a general enforcement of all the laws given byMoses; by promises of reward in case of obedience, on the one hand; andthreatenings of punishment for disobedience, on the other. While Israelmaintained a national regard to God's worship, sabbaths, and sanctuary,and did not turn aside to idolatry, the Lord engaged to continue tothem temporal mercies and religious advantages. These great andprecious promises, though they relate chiefly to the life which now is,were typical of the spiritual blessings made sure by the covenant ofgrace to all believers, through Christ. 1. Plenty and abundance of thefruits of the earth. Every good and perfect gift must be expected fromabove, from the Father of lights. 2. Peace under the Divine protection.Those dwell in safety, that dwell in God. 3. Victory and success intheir wars. It is all one with the Lord to save by many or by few. 4.The increase of their people. The gospel church shall be fruitful. 5.The favour of God, which is the fountain of all Good. 6. Tokens of hispresence in and by his ordinances. The way to have God's ordinancesfixed among us, is to cleave closely to them. 7. The grace of thecovenant. All covenant blessings are summed up in the covenantrelation, I will be your God, and ye shall be my people; and they areall grounded upon their redemption. Having purchased them, God wouldown them, and never cast them off till they cast him off. (Le 26:14-39)
Lev 26:14-39	<br>After God has set the blessing before them which would make them ahappy people if they would be obedient, he here sets the curse beforethem, the evils which would make them miserable, if they weredisobedient. Two things would bring ruin. 1. A contempt of God'scommandments. They that reject the precept, will come at last torenounce the covenant. 2. A contempt of his corrections. If they willnot learn obedience by the things they suffer, God himself would beagainst them; and this is the root and cause of all their misery. Andalso, The whole creation would be at war with them. All God's sorejudgments would be sent against them. The threatenings here are veryparticular, they were prophecies, and He that foresaw all theirrebellions, knew they would prove so. TEMPORAL judgments arethreatened. Those who will not be parted from their sins by thecommands of God, shall be parted from them by judgments. Those weddedto their lusts, will have enough of them. SPIRITUAL judgments arethreatened, which should seize the mind. They should find no acceptancewith God. A guilty conscience would be their continual terror. It isrighteous with God to leave those to despair of pardon, who presume tosin; and it is owing to free grace, if we are not left to pine away inthe iniquity we were born in, and have lived in.
Lev 26:40-46	<br>Among the Israelites, persons were not always prosperous or afflictedaccording to their obedience or disobedience. But national prosperitywas the effect of national obedience, and national judgments werebrought on by national wickedness. Israel was under a peculiarcovenant. National wickedness will end in the ruin of any people,especially where the word of God and the light of the gospel areenjoyed. Sooner or later, sin will be the ruin, as well as thereproach, of every people. Oh that, being humbled for our sins, wemight avert the rising storm before it bursts upon us! God grant thatwe may, in this our day, consider the things which belong to oureternal peace.
Lev 27:1-13	<br>Zeal for the service of God disposed the Israelites, on some occasions,to dedicate themselves or their children to the service of the Lord, inhis house for life. Some persons who thus dedicated themselves might beemployed as assistants; in general they were to be redeemed for avalue. It is good to be zealously affected and liberally disposed forthe Lord's service; but the matter should be well weighed, and prudenceshould direct as to what we do; else rash vows and hesitation in doingthem will dishonour God, and trouble our own minds.
Lev 27:14-25	<br>Our houses, lands, cattle, and all our substance, must be used to theglory of God. It is acceptable to him that a portion be given tosupport his worship, and to promote his cause. But God would notapprove such a degree of zeal as ruined a man's family.
Lev 27:26-33	<br>Things or persons devoted, are distinguished from things or personsthat were only sanctified. Devoted things were most holy to the Lord,and could neither be taken back nor applied to other purposes. Whateverproductions they had the benefit, God must be honoured with the tenthof, if it could be applied. Thus they acknowledge God to be the Ownerof their land, the Giver of its fruits, and themselves to be histenants, and dependants upon him. Thus they gave him thanks for theplenty they enjoyed, and besought his favour in the continuance of it.We are taught to honour the Lord with our substance.<br>Verse 34<br>The last verse seems to have reference to this whole book. Many of theprecepts in it are moral, and always binding; others are ceremonial,and peculiar to the Jewish nation; yet they have a spiritual meaning,and so teach us; for unto us, by these institutions, is the gospelpreached, as well as unto them, Heb 4:2. The doctrine of reconciliationto God by a Mediator, is not clouded with the smoke of burningsacrifice, but cleared by the knowledge of Christ and him crucified. Weare under the sweet and easy institutions of the gospel, whichpronounces those true worshippers, who worship the Father in spirit andtruth, by Christ only, and in his name. Yet, let us not think, becausewe are not tied to the ceremonial rites and oblations, that a littlecare, time, and expense, will serve to honour God with. Having boldnessto enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus, let us draw near witha true heart, and in full assurance of faith, worshipping God with themore cheerfulness and humble confidence, still saying, BLESSED BE GODFOR JESUS CHRIST.
Num 1:1-43	<br>The people were numbered to show God's faithfulness in thus increasingthe seed of Jacob, that they might be the better trained for the warsand conquest of Canaan, and to ascertain their families in order to thedivision of the land. It is said of each tribe, that those werenumbered who were able to go forth to war; they had wars before them,though now they met with no opposition. Let the believer be prepared towithstand the enemies of his soul, though all may appear to be peace.
Num 1:44-46	<br>We have here the sum total. How much was required to maintain all thesein the wilderness! They were all provided for by God every day. When weobserve the faithfulness of God, however unlikely the performance ofhis promise may appear, we may take courage as to those which yetremain to be fulfilled to the church of God.
Num 1:47-54	<br>Care is here taken to distinguish the tribe of Levi, which, in thematter of the golden calf, had distinguished itself. Singular servicesshall be recompensed by singular honours. It was to the honour of theLevites, that to them was committed the care of the tabernacle and itstreasures, in their camps and in their marches. It was for the honourof the holy things that none should see them, or touch them, but thosewho were called of God to the service. We all are unfit and unworthy tohave fellowship with God, till called by his grace into the fellowshipof his Son Jesus Christ our Lord; and so, being the spiritual seed ofthat great High Priest, we are made priests to our God. Great care mustbe taken to prevent sin, for preventing sin is preventing wrath. Beinga holy tribe, they were not reckoned among other Israelites. They thatminister about holy things, should neither entangle themselves, nor beentangled, in worldly affairs. And let every believer seek to do whatthe Lord has commanded.
Num 3:1-13	<br>There was much work belonging to the priests' office, and there werenow only Aaron and his two sons to do it; God appoints the Levites toattend them. Those whom God finds work for, he will find help for. TheLevites were taken instead of the first-born. When He that made us,saves us, as the first-born of Israel were saved, we are laid underfurther obligations to serve him faithfully. God's right to us byredemption, confirms the right he has to us by creation.
Num 3:14-39	<br>The Levites were in three classes, according to the sons of Levi;Gershon, Kohath, and Merari; and these were subdivided into families.The posterity of Moses were not at all honoured or privileged, butstood upon the level with other Levites; thus it was plain, that Mosesdid not seek the advancement of his own family, or to secure anyhonours to it. The tribe of Levi was by much the least of all thetribes. God's chosen are but a little flock in comparison with theworld.
Num 3:40-51	<br>The number of the first-born, and that of the Levites, came near toeach other. Known unto God are all his works beforehand; there is anexact proportion between them, and so it will appear, when they arecompared together. The small number of first-born, over and above thenumber of the Levites, were to be redeemed, and the redemption-moneygiven to Aaron. The church is called the church of the first-born,which is redeemed, not as they were, with silver and gold; but, beingdevoted by sin to the justice of God, is ransomed with the preciousblood of the Son of God. All men are the Lord's by creation, and alltrue christians are his by redemption. Each should know his own postand duty; nor can any service required by such a Master be rightlyaccounted mean or hard.
Num 4:1-3	<br>The middle-aged men of the tribe of Levi, all from thirty years old tofifty, were to be employed in the service of the tabernacle. Theservice of God requires the best of our strength, and the prime portionof our time, which cannot be better spent than to the honour of Him whois the First and Best. And the service of God should be done when weare most lively and active. Those do not consider this who put offrepentance to old age, and so leave the best work to be done in theworst time.
Num 4:4-20	<br>The Kohathites were to carry the holy things of the tabernacle. All theholy things were to be covered; not only for security and respect, butto keep them from being seen. This not only marked the reverence due toholy things, but the mystery of the things signified by those types,and the darkness of the dispensation. But now, through Christ, the caseis altered, and we are encouraged to come boldly to the throne ofgrace.
Num 4:21-33	<br>We have here the charge of the other two families of the Levites,which, though not so honourable as the first, yet was necessary, and tobe done regularly. All the things were delivered them by name. Itintimates the care God takes of his church and every member of it. Thedeath of the saints is represented as the taking down of thetabernacle, 2Co 5:1, and the putting it off, 2Pe 1:14. All shall beraised up in the great day, when these vile bodies shall be made likethe glorious body of Jesus Christ, and so shall be for ever with theLord.
Num 4:34-49	<br>God so ordered it, that though the Merarites were the fewest in number,yet they should have most able men among them; for whatever service Godcalls men to, he will furnish them for it, give strength in proportionto the work, and grace sufficient. The least of the tribes had manymore able men than the Levites: those who engage in the service of thisworld, are many more than those devoted to the service of God. May oursouls be wholly devoted to his service.
Num 5:1-10	<br>The camp was to be cleansed. The purity of the church must be kept ascarefully as the peace and order of it. Every polluted Israelite mustbe separated. The wisdom from above is first pure, then peaceable. Thegreater profession of religion any house or family makes, the more theyare obliged to put away iniquity far from them. If a man overreach ordefraud his brother in any matter, it is a trespass against the Lord,who strictly charges and commands us to do justly. What is to be donewhen a man's awakened conscience charges him with guilt of this kind,though done long ago? He must confess his sin, confess it to God,confess it to his neighbour, and take shame to himself; though it goagainst him to own himself in a lie, yet he must do it. Satisfactionmust be made for the offence done to God, as well as for the losssustained by the neighbour; restitution in that case is not enoughwithout faith and repentance. While that which is wrongly gotten isknowingly kept, the guilt remains on the conscience, and is not doneaway by sacrifice or offering, prayers or tears; for it is the same actof sin persisted in. This is the doctrine of right reason, and of theword of God. It detects hypocrites, and directs the tender conscienceto proper conduct, which, springing from faith in Christ, will make wayfor inward peace.
Num 5:11-31	<br>This law would make the women of Israel watch against giving cause forsuspicion. On the other hand, it would hinder the cruel treatment suchsuspicions might occasion. It would also hinder the guilty fromescaping, and the innocent from coming under just suspicion. When noproof could be brought, the wife was called on to make this solemnappeal to a heart-searching God. No woman, if she were guilty, couldsay "Amen" to the adjuration, and drink the water after it, unless shedisbelieved the truth of God, or defied his justice. The water iscalled the bitter water, because it caused the curse. Thus sin iscalled an evil and a bitter thing. Let all that meddle with forbiddenpleasures, know that they will be bitterness in the latter end. Fromthe whole learn, 1. Secret sins are known to God, and sometimes arestrangely brought to light in this life; and that there is a day comingwhen God will, by Christ, judge the secrets of men according to thegospel, Ro 2:16. 2 In particular, Whoremongers and adulterers God willsurely judge. Though we have not now the waters of jealousy, yet wehave God's word, which ought to be as great a terror. Sensual lustswill end in bitterness. 3. God will manifest the innocency of theinnocent. The same providence is for good to some, and for hurt toothers. And it will answer the purposes which God intends.
Num 6:1-21	<br>The word Nazarite signifies separation. Some were appointed of God,before their birth, to be Nazarites all their days, as Samson and Johnthe Baptist. But, in general, it was a vow of separation from the worldand devotedness to the services of religion, for a limited time, andunder certain rules, which any person might make if they pleased. ANazarite is spoken of as well known; but his obligation is brought to agreater certainty than before. That the fancies of superstitious menmight not multiply the restraints endlessly, God gives them rules. Theymust not drink wine or strong drink, nor eat grapes. Those who separatethemselves to God, must not gratify the desires of the body, but keepit under. Let all Christians be very moderate in the use of wine andstrong drink; for if the love of these once gets the mastery of a man,he becomes an easy prey to Satan. The Nazarites were to eat nothingthat came of the vine; this may teach the utmost care to avoid sin, andall that borders upon it, and leads to it, or may be a temptation tous. They must not cut their hair. They must neither poll their heads,nor shave their beards; this was the mark of Samson being a Nazarite.This signified neglect of the body, and of the ease and ornament of it.Those who separate themselves to God, must keep their consciences purefrom dead works, and not touch unclean things. All the days of theirseparation they must be holy to the Lord. This was the meaning of thoseoutward observances, and without this they were of no account. Nopenalty or sacrifice was appointed for those who wilfully broke theirvow of being Nazarites; they must answer another day for such profanetrifling with the Lord their God; but those were to be relieved who didnot sin wilfully. There is nothing in Scripture that bears the leastresemblance to the religious orders of the church of Rome, except theseNazarites. But mark the difference, or rather how completely opposed!The religious of that church are forbidden to marry; but no suchrestriction is laid upon the Nazarites. They are commanded to abstainfrom meats; but the Nazarites might eat any food allowed otherIsraelites. They are not generally forbidden wine, not even on theirfasting days; but the Nazarites might not have wine at any time. Theirvow is lasting, even to the end of their lives; the Nazarites' vow wasonly for a limited time, at their own will; and in certain cases notunless allowed by husbands or parents. Such a thorough difference thereis between rules of man's invention and those directed in Scripture,Let us not forget that the Lord Jesus is not only our Surety, but alsoour example. For his sake we must renounce worldly pleasures, abstainfrom fleshy lusts, be separate from sinners, make open profession ofour faith, moderate natural affections, be spiritually-minded, anddevoted to God's service, and desirous to be an example all around us.(Nu 6:22-27)
Num 6:22-27	<br>The priests were solemnly to bless the people in the name of the Lord.To be under the almighty protection of God our Saviour; to enjoy hisfavour as the smile of a loving Father, or as the cheering beams of thesun; while he mercifully forgives our sins, supplies our wants,consoles the heart, and prepares us by his grace for eternal glory;these things form the substance of this blessing, and the sum total ofall blessings. In so rich a list of mercies worldly joys are not worthyto be mentioned. Here is a form of prayer. The name Jehovah is threetimes repeated. The Jews think there is some mystery; and we know whatit is, the New Testament having explained it. There we are directed toexpect the blessing from the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, the loveof the Father, and the communion of the Holy Ghost, 2Co 13:14; each ofwhich Persons is Jehovah, and yet they are not three Lords, but oneLord.
Num 7:1-9	<br>The offering of the princes to the service of the tabernacle was notmade till it was fully set up. Necessary observances must always takeplace of free-will offerings. The more any are advanced, the greateropportunity they have of serving God and their generation. No soonerwas the tabernacle set up, than provision is made for the removal ofit. Even when but just settled in the world, we must be preparing forchanges and removes, especially for the great change.
Num 7:10-89	<br>The princes and great men were most forward in the service of God. Hereis an example to those in authority, and of the highest rank; theyought to use their honour and power, their estate and interest, topromote religion and the service of God in the places where they live.Though it was a time of joy and rejoicing, yet still, in the midst oftheir sacrifices, we find a sin-offering. As, in our best services, weare conscious that there is sin, there should be repentance, even inour most joyful services. In all approaches to God we must by faithlook to Christ as the Sin-offering. They brought their offerings eachon a day. God's work should not be done confusedly, or in a hurry; taketime, and we shall have done the sooner, or, at least, we shall havedone the better. If services are to be done for twelve days together,we must not call it a task and a burden. All their offerings were thesame; all the tribes of Israel had an equal share in the altar, and anequal interest in the sacrifices offered upon it. He who now spake toMoses, as the Shechinah or Divine Majesty, from between the Cherubim,was the Eternal Word, the second Person in the Trinity; for all God'scommunion with man is by his Son, by whom he made the world, and rulesthe church, who is the same yesterday, to-day, and for ever.
Num 8:1-4	<br>Aaron himself lighted the lamps, thus representing his Divine Master.The Scripture is a light shining in a dark place, 2Pe 1:19. A darkplace even the church would be without it; as the tabernacle, which hadno window, would have been without the lamps. The work of ministers isto light these lamps, by expounding and applying the word of God. JesusChrist is the only Light of our dark, sinful world; and by hisatonement, by his word and the Holy Spirit, he diffuses light around.
Num 8:5-26	<br>Here we have directions for the solemn ordination of the Levites. AllIsrael must know that they took not this honour to themselves, but werecalled of God to it; nor was it enough that they were distinguishedfrom others. All who are employed for God, must be dedicated to him,according to the employment. Christians must be baptized, ministersmust be ordained; we must first give ourselves unto the Lord, and thenour services. The Levites must be cleansed. They must be clean thatbear the vessels of the Lord. Moses must sprinkle the water ofpurifying upon them. This signifies the application of the blood ofChrist to our souls by faith, that we may be fit to serve the livingGod. God declares his acceptance of them. All who expect to share inthe privileges of the tabernacle, must resolve to do the service of thetabernacle. As, on the one hand, none of God's creatures are hisnecessary servants, he needs not the service of any of them; so noneare merely honorary servants, to do nothing. All whom God owns, heemploys; angels themselves have their services.
Num 9:1-14	<br>God gave particular orders for the keeping of this passover, and, foraught that appears, after this, they kept no passover till they came toCanaan, Jos 5:10. It early showed that the ceremonial institutions werenot to continue always, as so soon after they were appointed, some weresuffered to sleep for many years. But the ordinance of the Lord'sSupper was not thus set aside in the first days of the Christianchurch, although those were days of greater difficulty and distressthan Israel knew in the wilderness; nay, in the times of persecution,the Lord's Supper was celebrated more frequently than afterward.Israelites in the wilderness could not forget the deliverance out ofEgypt. There was danger of this when they came to Canaan. Instructionswere given concerning those who were ceremonially unclean, when theywere to eat the passover. Those whose minds and consciences are defiledby sin, are unfit for communion with God, and cannot partake withcomfort of the gospel passover, till they are cleansed by truerepentance and faith. Observe with what trouble and concern these mencomplained that they were kept back from offering to the Lord. Itshould be a trouble to us, when by any occasion we are kept back fromthe solemnities of a sabbath or a sacrament. Observe the deliberationof Moses in resolving this case. Ministers must ask counsel of God'smouth, not determine according to their own fancy or affection, butaccording to the word of God to the best of their knowledge. And if, indifficult cases, time is taken to spread the matter before God byhumble, believing prayer, the Holy Spirit assuredly will direct in thegood and right way. God gave directions in this case, and in othersimilar cases, explanatory of the law of the passover. As those who,against their minds, are forced to absent themselves from God'sordinances, may expect the favours of God's grace under theiraffliction, so those who, of choice, absent themselves, may expectGod's wrath for their sin. Be not deceived: God is not mocked.
Num 9:15-23	<br>This cloud was appointed to be the visible sign and symbol of God'spresence with Israel. Thus we are taught to see God always near us,both night and day. As long as the cloud rested on the tabernacle, solong they continued in the same place. There is no time lost, while weare waiting God's time. When the cloud was taken up, they removed,however comfortably they were encamped. We are kept at uncertaintyconcerning the time of our putting off the earthly house of thistabernacle, that we may be always ready to remove at the command of theLord. It is very safe and pleasant going when we see God before us, andresting where he appoints us to rest. The leading of this cloud isspoken of as signifying the guidance of the blessed Spirit. We are notnow to expect such tokens of the Divine presence and guidance; but thepromise is sure to all God's spiritual Israel, that he will guide themby his counsel. Ps 73:24, even unto death, Ps 48:14. All the childrenof God shall be led by the Spirit of God, Ro 8:14. He will direct thepaths of those who in all their ways acknowledge him, Pr 3:6. At thecommandment of the Lord, our hearts should always move and rest,saying, Father, thy will be done; dispose of me and mine as thoupleasest. What thou wilt, and where thou wilt; only let me be thine,and always in the way of my duty. In applying general precepts toparticular circumstances, there should be good counsel and ferventprayer. When any undertaking is evidently wrong, or doubtfully right,and yet the mind leans that way, in such a case "the moving of thecloud," as men sometimes miscall it, is generally no more than atemptation Satan is permitted to propose; and men fancy they arefollowing the Lord, when they are following their own waywardinclinations. The record of his mercy will conduct us with unerringtruth, through Christ, to everlasting peace. Follow the pillar of thecloud and of fire. Lay the BIBLE to heart, and receive with meeknessthe ingrafted word, which is able to save your souls.
Num 10:1-10	<br>Here are directions concerning the public notices to be given thepeople by sound of trumpet. Their laws in every case were to be Divine,therefore, even in this matter Moses is directed. These trumpets typifythe preached gospel. It sounds an alarm to sinners, calls them torepent, proclaims liberty to the captives and slaves of Satan, andcollects the worshippers of God. It directs and encourages theirheavenly journey; stirs them up to combat against the world and sin,encouraging them with the assurance of victory. It leads theirattention to the sacrifice of Christ, and shows the Lord's presence fortheir protection. It is also necessary that the gospel trumpet give adistinct sound, according to the persons addressed, or the endproposed; whether to convince, humble, console, exhort, reprove, orteach. The sounding of the trumpet of the gospel is God's ordinance,and demands the attention of all to whom it is sent. (Nu 10:11-28)
Num 10:11-28	<br>After the Israelites had continued nearly a year at mount Sinai, andall was settled respecting their future worship, they began their marchto Canaan. True religion begins with the knowledge of the holy law ofGod, and humiliation for sin, but we must go on towards perfection, inacquaintance with Christ and his gospel, and those effectualencouragements, motives, and assistances to holiness, which itproposes. They took their journey according to the commandment of theLord, De 1:6-8, and as the cloud led them. Those who give themselves tothe direction of God's word and Spirit, steer a steady course, evenwhen they seem bewildered. While they are sure they cannot lose theirGod and Guide, they need not fear losing their way. They went out ofthe wilderness of Sinai, and rested in the wilderness of Paran. All ourremoves in this world are but from one wilderness to another. Thechanges we think will be for the better do not always prove so. Weshall never be at rest, never at home, till we come to heaven, but allwill be well there.
Num 10:29-32	<br>Moses invites his kindred to go to Canaan. Those that are bound for theheavenly Canaan, should ask and encourage their friends to go withthem: we shall have none the less of the joys of heaven, for otherscoming to share with us. It is good having fellowship with those whohave fellowship with God. But the things of this world, which are seen,draw strongly from the pursuit of the things of the other world, whichare not seen. Moses urges that Hobab might be serviceable to them. Notto show where they must encamp, nor what way they must march, the cloudwas to direct that; but to show the conveniences of the place theymarched through, and encamped in. It well consists with our trust inGod's providence, to use the help of our friends.
Num 10:33-36	<br>Their going out and coming in, gives an example to us to begin and endevery day's journey and every day's work with prayer. Here is Moses'sprayer when the ark set forward, "Rise up, and let thine enemies bescattered." There are those in the world who are enemies to God andhaters of him; secret and open enemies; enemies to his truths, hislaws, his ordinances, his people. But for the scattering and defeatingof God's enemies, there needs no more than God's arising. Observe alsothe prayer of Moses when the ark rested, that God would cause hispeople to rest. The welfare and happiness of the Israel of God, consistin the continual presence of God among them. Their safety is not intheir numbers, but in the favour of God, and his gracious return tothem, and resting with them. Upon this account, Happy art thou, OIsrael! who is like unto thee, O people! God will go before them, tofind them resting-places by the way. His promise is, and their prayersare, that he will never leave them nor forsake them.
Num 11:1-3	<br>Here is the people's sin; they complained. See the sinfulness of sin,which takes occasion from the commandment to be provoking. The weaknessof the law discovered sin, but could not destroy it; checked, but couldnot conquer it. They complained. Those who are of a discontentedspirit, will always find something to quarrel or fret about, though thecircumstances of their outward condition be ever so favourable. TheLord heard it, though Moses did not. God knows the secret frettings andmurmurings of the heart, though concealed from men. What he noticed, hewas much displeased with, and he chastised them for this sin. The fireof their wrath against God burned in their minds; justly did the fireof God's wrath fasten on their bodies; but God's judgments came on themgradually, that they might take warning. It appeared that God delightsnot in punishing; when he begins, he is soon prevailed with to let itfall.
Num 11:4-9	<br>Man, having forsaken his proper rest, feels uneasy and wretched, thoughprosperous. They were weary of the provision God had made for them,although wholesome food and nourishing. It cost no money or care, andthe labour of gathering it was very little indeed; yet they talked ofEgypt's cheapness, and the fish they ate there freely; as if that costthem nothing, when they paid dearly for it with hard service! Whilethey lived on manna, they seemed exempt from the curse sin has broughton man, that in the sweat of his face he should eat bread; yet theyspeak of it with scorn. Peevish, discontented minds will find faultwith that which has no fault in it, but that it is too good for them.Those who might be happy, often make themselves miserable bydiscontent. They could not be satisfied unless they had flesh to eat.It is evidence of the dominion of the carnal mind, when we want to havethe delights and satisfaction of sense. We should not indulge in anydesire which we cannot in faith turn into prayer, as we cannot when weask meat for our lust. What is lawful of itself becomes evil, when Goddoes not allot it to us, yet we desire it.
Num 11:10-15	<br>The provocation was very great; yet Moses expressed himself otherwisethan became him. He undervalued the honour God had put upon him. Hemagnified his own performances, while he had the Divine wisdom todirect him, and Almighty power to dispense rewards and punishments. Hespeaks distrustfully of the Divine grace. Had the work been much lesshe could not have gone through it in his own strength; but had it beenmuch greater, through God strengthening him, he might have done it. Letus pray, Lord, lead us not into temptation.
Num 11:16-23	<br>Moses is to choose such as he knew to be elders, that is, wise andexperienced men. God promises to qualify them. If they were not foundfit for the employ, they should be made fit. Even the discontentedpeople shall be gratified too, that every mouth may be stopped. Seehere, I. The vanity of all the delights of sense; they will cloy, butthey will not satisfy. Spiritual pleasures alone will satisfy and last.As the world passes away, so do the lusts of it. 2. What brutish sinsgluttony and drunkenness are! they make that to hurt the body whichshould be its health. Moses objects. Even true and great believerssometimes find it hard to trust God under the discouragements of secondcauses, and against hope to believe in hope. God here brings Moses tothis point, The Lord God is Almighty; and puts the proof upon theissue, Thou shalt see whether my word shall come to pass or not. If hespeaks, it is done.
Num 11:24-30	<br>We have here the fulfilment of God's word to Moses, that he should havehelp in the government of Israel. He gave of his Spirit to the seventyelders. They discoursed to the people of the things of God, so that allwho heard them might say, that God was with them of a truth. Two of theelders, Eldad and Medad, went not out unto the tabernacle, as the rest,being sensible of their own weakness and unworthiness. But the Spiritof God found them in the camp, and there they exercised their gift ofpraying, preaching, and praising God; they spake as moved by the HolyGhost. The Spirit of God is not confined to the tabernacle, but, likethe wind, blows where He listeth. And they that humble themselves shallbe exalted; and those who are most fit for government, are leastambitious of it. Joshua does not desire that they should be punished,but only restrained for the future. This motion he made out of zeal forwhat he thought to be the unity of the church. He would have themsilenced, lest they should occasion a schism, or should rival Moses;but Moses was not afraid of any such effects from that Spirit which Godhad put upon them. Shall we reject those whom Christ has owned, orrestrain any from doing good, because they are not in every thing ofour mind? Moses wishes all the Lord's people were prophets, that hewould put his Spirit upon all of them. Let the testimony of Moses bebelieved by those who desire to be in power; that government is aburden. It is a burden of care and trouble to those who make conscienceof the duty of it; and to those who do not, it will prove a heavierburden in the day of account. Let the example of Moses be followed bythose in power; let them not despise the advice and assistance ofothers, but desire it, and be thankful for it. If all the presentnumber of the Lord's people were rendered prophets, or ministers, bythe Spirit of Christ, though not all agreed in outward matters, thereis work enough for all, in calling sinners to repentance, and faith inour Lord Jesus.
Num 11:31-35	<br>God performed his promise to the people, in giving them flesh. How muchmore diligent men are in collecting the meat that perishes, than inlabouring for meat which endures to everlasting life! We arequick-sighted in the affairs of time; but stupidity blinds us as to theconcerns of eternity. To pursue worldly advantages, we need noarguments; but when we are to secure the true riches, then we are allforgetfulness. Those who are under the power of a carnal mind, willhave their lusts fulfilled, though it be to the certain damage and ruinof their precious souls. They paid dearly for their feasts. God oftengrants the desires of sinners in wrath, while he denies the desires ofhis own people in love. What we unduly desire, if we obtain it, we havereason to fear, will be some way or other a grief and cross to us. Andwhat multitudes there are in all places, who shorten their lives byexcess of one kind or other! Let us seek for those pleasures whichsatisfy, but never surfeit; and which will endure for evermore.
Num 12:1-9	<br>The patience of Moses was tried in his own family, as well as by thepeople. The pretence was, that he had married a foreign wife; butprobably their pride was hurt, and their envy stirred up, by hissuperior authority. Opposition from our near relations, and fromreligious friends, is most painful. But this is to be looked for, andit will be well if in such circumstances we can preserve the gentlenessand meekness of Moses. Moses was thus fitted to the work he was calledto. God not only cleared Moses, but praised him. Moses had the spiritof prophecy in a way which set him far above all other prophets; yet hethat is least in the kingdom of heaven, is greater than he; and ourLord Jesus infinitely excels him, Heb 3:1. Let Miriam and Aaronconsider whom it was they insulted. We have reason to be afraid ofsaying or doing any thing against the servants of God. And those arepresumptuous indeed who are not afraid to speak evil of dignities, 2Pe2:10. The removal of God's presence is the surest and saddest token ofGod's displeasure. Woe to us, if he depart! he never departs, till bysin and folly we drive him from us.
Num 12:10-16	<br>The cloud departed, and Miriam became leprous. When God goes, evilcomes: expect no good when God departs. Her foul tongue, as Bishop Hallsays, was justly punished with a foul face. Aaron, as priest, was judgeof the leprosy. He could not pronounce her leprous without trembling,knowing himself to be equally guilty. But if she was thus punished forspeaking against Moses, what will become of those who sin againstChrist? Aaron, who joined his sister in speaking against Moses, isforced for himself and his sister, to beseech him, and to speak highlyof him whom he had so lately blamed. Those who trample upon the saintsand servants of God, will one day be glad to make court to them. It iswell when rebukes produce confession of sin and repentance. Suchoffenders, though corrected and disgraced, shall be pardoned. Mosesmade it appear, that he forgave the injury done him. To this pattern ofMoses, and that of our Saviour, who said, "Father, forgive them," wemust conform. A reason is given for Miriam's being put out of the campfor seven days; because thus she ought to accept the punishment of hersin. When under the tokens of God's displeasure for sin, it becomes usto take shame to ourselves. This hindered the people's progress intheir march forward towards Canaan. Many things oppose us, but nothingso hinders us in the way to heaven, as sin.
Num 13:1-20	<br>A memorable and melancholy history is related in this and the followingchapter, of the turning back of Israel from the borders of Canaan, andthe sentencing them to wander and perish in the wilderness, for theirunbelief and murmuring. It appears, De 1:22, that the motion to searchout the land came from the people. They had a better opinion of theirown policy than of God's wisdom. Thus we ruin ourselves by believingthe reports and representations of sense rather than Divine revelation.We walk by sight not by faith. Moses gave the spies this charge, Be ofgood courage. It was not only a great undertaking they were put upon,which required good management and resolution; but a great trust wasreposed in them, which required that they should be faithful. Couragein such circumstances can only spring from strong faith, which Caleband Joshua alone possessed.
Num 13:21-25	<br>The searchers of the land brought a bunch of grapes with them, andother fruits, as proofs of the goodness of the country; which was toIsrael both the earnest and the specimen of all the fruits of Canaan.Such are the present comforts we have in communion with God, foretastesof the fulness of joy we expect in the heavenly Canaan. We may see bythem what heaven is.
Num 13:26-33	<br>We may wonder that the people of Israel staid forty days for the returnof their spies, when they were ready to enter Canaan, under all theassurances of success they could have from the Divine power, and themiracles that had hitherto attended them. But they distrusted God'spower and promise. How much we stand in our own light by our unbelief!At length the messengers returned; but the greater part discouraged thepeople from going forward to Canaan. Justly are the Israelites left tothis temptation, for putting confidence in the judgment of men, whenthey had the word of God to trust in. Though they had found the land asgood as God had said, yet they would not believe it to be as sure as hehad said, but despaired of having it, though Eternal Truth had engagedit to them. This was the representation of the evil spies. Caleb,however, encouraged them to go forward, though seconded by Joshua only.He does not say, Let us go up and conquer it; but, Let us go andpossess it. Difficulties that are in the way of salvation, dwindle andvanish before a lively, active faith in the power and promise of God.All things are possible, if they are promised, to him that believes;but carnal sense and carnal professors are not to be trusted. Unbeliefoverlooks the promises and power of God, magnifies every danger anddifficulty, and fills the heart with discouragement. May the Lord helpus to believe! we shall then find all things possible.
Num 14:1-4	<br>Those who do not trust God, continually vex themselves. The sorrow ofthe world worketh death. The Israelites murmured against Moses andAaron, and in them reproached the Lord. They look back with causelessdiscontent. See the madness of unbridled passions, which makes menprodigal of what nature accounts most dear, life itself. They wishrather to die criminals under God's justice, than to live conquerors inhis favour. At last they resolve, that, instead of going forward toCanaan, they would go back to Egypt. Those who walk not in God'scounsels, seek their own ruin. Could they expect that God's cloud wouldlead them, or his manna attend them? Suppose the difficulties ofconquering Canaan were as they imagined, those of returning to Egyptwere much greater. We complain of our place and lot, and we wouldchange; but is there any place or condition in this world, that has notsomething in it to make us uneasy, if we are disposed to be so? The wayto better our condition, is to get our spirits in a better frame. Seethe folly of turning from the ways of God. But men run on the certainfatal consequences of a sinful course.
Num 14:5-10	<br>Moses and Aaron were astonished to see a people throw away their ownmercies. Caleb and Joshua assured the people of the goodness of theland. They made nothing of the difficulties in the way of their gainingit. If men were convinced of the desirableness of the gains ofreligion, they would not stick at the services of it. Though theCanaanites dwell in walled cities, their defence was departed fromthem. The other spies took notice of their strength, but these of theirwickedness. No people can be safe, when they have provoked God to leavethem. Though Israel dwell in tents, they are fortified. While we havethe presence of God with us, we need not fear the most powerful forceagainst us. Sinners are ruined by their own rebellion. But those who,like Caleb and Joshua, faithfully expose themselves for God, are sureto be taken under his special protection, and shall be hid from therage of men, either under heaven or in heaven. (Nu 14:11-19)
Num 14:11-19	<br>Moses made humble intercession for Israel. Herein he was a type ofChrist, who prayed for those that despitefully used him. The pardon ofa nation's sin, is the turning away the nation's punishment; and forthat Moses is here so earnest. Moses argued that, consistently withGod's character, in his abundant mercies, he could forgive them.
Num 14:20-35	<br>The Lord granted the prayer of Moses so far as not at once to destroythe congregation. But disbelief of the promise forbids the benefit.Those who despise the pleasant land shall be shut out of it. Thepromise of God should be fulfilled to their children. They wished todie in the wilderness; God made their sin their ruin, took them attheir word, and their carcases fell in the wilderness. They were madeto groan under the burden of their own sin, which was too heavy forthem to bear. Ye shall know my breach of promise, both the causes ofit, that it is procured by your sin, for God never leaves any till theyfirst leave him; and the consequences of it, that will produce yourruin. But your little ones, now under twenty years old, which ye, inyour unbelief, said should be a prey, them will I bring in. God willlet them know that he can put a difference between the guilty and theinnocent, and cut them off without touching their children. Thus Godwould not utterly take away his loving kindness.
Num 14:36-39	<br>Here is the sudden death of the ten evil spies. They sinned in bringinga slander upon the land of promise. Those greatly provoke God, whomisrepresent religion, raise dislike in men's minds toward it, or giveopportunity to those to do so, who seek occasion. Justly are murmurersmade mourners. If they had mourned for the sin, when they werefaithfully reproved, the sentence had been prevented; but as theymourned for the judgment only, it did them no service. There is in hellsuch mourning as this; but tears will not quench the flames, nor coolthe tongue.
Num 14:40-45	<br>Some of the Israelites were now earnest to go forward toward Canaan.But it came too late. If men would but be as earnest for heaven whiletheir day of grace lasts, as they will be when it is over, how wellwould it be for them! That which has been duty in its season, whenmistimed, may be turned into sin. Those who are out of the way of theirduty, are not under God's protection, and go at their peril. God badethem go, and they would not; he forbade them, and they would go. Thusis the carnal mind enmity against God. They had distrusted God'sstrength; they now presume upon their own without his. And theexpedition fails accordingly; now the sentence began to be executed,that their carcases should fall in the wilderness. That affair cannever end well, which begins with sin. The way to obtain peace with ourfriends, and success against our enemies, is, to have God, as ourFriend, and to keep in his love. Let us take warning from the fate ofIsrael, lest we perish after the same example of unbelief. Let us goforth, depending on God's mercy, power, promise, and truth; he will bewith us, and bring our souls to everlasting rest.
Num 15:1-21	<br>Full instructions are given about the meat-offerings anddrink-offerings. The beginning of this law is very encouraging, When yecome into the land of your habitation which I give unto you. This was aplain intimation that God would secure the promised land to their seed.It was requisite, since the sacrifices of acknowledgment were intendedas the food of God's table, that there should be a constant supply ofbread, oil, and wine, whatever the flesh-meat was. And the intent ofthis law is to direct the proportions of the meat-offering anddrink-offering. Natives and strangers are placed on a level in this asin other like matters. It was a happy forewarning of the calling of theGentiles, and of their admission into the church. If the law made solittle difference between Jew and Gentile, much less would the gospel,which broke down the partition-wall, and reconciled both to God.
Num 15:22-29	<br>Though ignorance will in a degree excuse, it will not justify those whomight have known their Lord's will, yet did it not. David prayed to becleansed from his secret faults, those sins which he himself was notaware of. Sins committed ignorantly, shall be forgiven through Christthe great Sacrifice, who, when he offered up himself once for all uponthe cross, seemed to explain one part of the intention of his offering,in that prayer, Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do.It looked favourably upon the Gentiles, that this law of atoning forsins of ignorance, is expressly made to extend to those who werestrangers to Israel.
Num 15:30-36	<br>Those are to be reckoned presumptuous sinners, who sin designedlyagainst God's will and glory. Sins thus committed are exceedinglysinful. He that thus breaks the commandment reproaches the Lord. Healso despises the word of the Lord. Presumptuous sinners despise it,thinking themselves too great, too good, and too wise, to be ruled byit. A particular instance of presumption in the sin of sabbath-breakingis related. The offence was gathering sticks on the sabbath day, tomake a fire, whereas the people were to bake and seethe what they hadoccasion for, the day before, Ex 16:23. This was done as an affrontboth to the law and to the Lawgiver. God is jealous for the honour ofhis sabbaths, and will not hold him guiltless who profanes them,whatever men may do. God intended this punishment for a warning to all,to make conscience of keeping holy the sabbath. And we may be assuredthat no command was ever given for the punishment of sin, which, at thejudgment day, shall not prove to have come from perfect love andjustice. The right of God to a day of devotion to himself, will bedisputed and denied only by such as listen to the pride and unbelief oftheir hearts, rather than to the teaching of the Spirit of truth andlife. Wherein consists the difference between him who was detectedgathering sticks in the wilderness on the day of God, and the man whoturns his back upon the blessings of sabbath appointments, and thepromises of sabbath mercies, to use his time, his cares, and his soul,in heaping up riches; and waste his hours, his property, and hisstrength in sinful pleasure? Wealth may come by the unhallowed effort,but it will not come alone; it will have its awful reward. Sinfulpursuits lead to ruin.
Num 15:37-41	<br>The people are ordered by the Lord to make fringes on the borders oftheir garments. The Jews were distinguished from their neighbours intheir dress, as well as in their diet, and thus taught not to beconformed to the way of the heathen in other things. They proclaimedthemselves Jews wherever they were, as not ashamed of God and his law.The fringes were not appointed for trimming and adorning their clothes,but to stir up their minds by way of remembrance, 2Pe 3:1. If they weretempted to sin, the fringe would warn them not to break God'scommandments. We should use every means of refreshing our memories withthe truths and precepts of God's word, to strengthen and quicken ourobedience, and arm our minds against temptation. Be holy unto your God;cleansed from sin, and sincerely devoted to his service; and that greatreason for all the commandments is again and again repeated, "I am theLord your God."
Num 16:1-11	<br>Pride and ambition occasion a great deal of mischief both in churchesand states. The rebels quarrel with the settlement of the priesthoodupon Aaron and his family. Small reason they had to boast of thepeople's purity, or of God's favour, as the people had been so oftenand so lately polluted with sin, and were now under the marks of God'sdispleasure. They unjustly charge Moses and Aaron with taking honour tothemselves; whereas they were called of God to it. See here, 1. Whatspirit levellers are of; those who resist the powers God has set overthem. 2. What usage they have been serviceable. Moses soughtinstruction from God. The heart of the wise studies to answer, and askscounsel of God. Moses shows their privileges as Levites, and convictsthem of the sin of undervaluing these privileges. It will help to keepus from envying those above us, duly to consider how many there arebelow us.
Num 16:12-15	<br>Moses summoned Dathan and Abiram to bring their complaints; but theywould not obey. They bring very false charges against Moses. Thoseoften fall under the heaviest censures, who in truth deserve thehighest praise. Moses, though the meekest man, yet, finding Godreproached in him, was very wroth; he could not bear to see the peopleruining themselves. He appeals to God as to his own integrity. He badethem appear with Aaron next morning, at the time of offering themorning incense. Korah undertook thus to appear. Proud ambitious men,while projecting their own advancement, often hurry on their ownshameful fall.
Num 16:16-22	<br>The same glory of the Lord that appeared to place Aaron in his officeat first, Le 9:23, now appeared to confirm him in it; and to confoundthose who set up against him. Nothing is more terrible to those who areconscious of guilt, than the appearance of the Divine glory. See howdangerous it is to have fellowship with sinners, and to partake withthem. Though the people had treacherously deserted them, yet Moses andAaron approved themselves faithful shepherds of Israel. If others failin their duty to us, that does not take away the obligations we areunder to seek their welfare. Their prayer was a pleading prayer, and itproved a prevailing one.
Num 16:23-34	<br>The seventy elders of Israel attend Moses. It is our duty to do what wecan to countenance and support lawful authority when it is opposed. Andthose who would not perish with sinners, must come out from among them,and be separate. It was in answer to the prayer of Moses, that Godstirred up the hearts of the congregation to remove for their ownsafety. Grace to separate from evil-doers is one of the things thataccompany salvation. God, in justice, left the rebels to the obstinacyand hardness of their own hearts. Moses, by Divine direction, when allIsrael were waiting the event, declares that if the rebels die a commondeath, he will be content to be called and counted an imposter. As soonas Moses had spoken the word, God caused the earth to open and swallowthem all up. The children perished with their parents; in which, thoughwe cannot tell how bad they might be to deserve it, or how good Godmight be otherwise to them; yet of this we are sure, that InfiniteJustice did them no wrong. It was altogether miraculous. God has, whenhe pleases, strange punishments for the workers of iniquity. It wasvery significant. Considering how the earth is still in like mannerloaded with the weight of man's sins, we have reason to wonder that itdoes not now sink under its load. The ruin of others should be ourwarning. Could we, by faith, hear the outcries of those that are gonedown to the bottomless pit, we should give more diligence than we do toescape for our lives, lest we also come into their condemnation.
Num 16:35-40	<br>A fire went out from the Lord, and consumed the two hundred and fiftymen that offered incense, while Aaron, who stood with them, waspreserved alive. God is jealous of the honour of his own institutions,and will not have them invaded. The sacrifice of the wicked is anabomination to the Lord. The censers are devoted, and, as all devotedthings, must be made serviceable to the glory of God. This covering ofthe altar would remind the children of Israel of this event, thatothers might hear and fear, and do no more presumptuously. They broughtdestruction on themselves both in body and soul. Thus all who break thelaw and neglect the gospel choose and love death.
Num 16:41-50	<br>The gaping earth was scarcely closed, before the same sins are againcommitted, and all these warnings slighted. They called the rebels thepeople of the Lord; and find fault with Divine justice. The obstinacyof Israel notwithstanding the terrors of God's law, as given on mountSinai, and the terrors of his judgments, shows how necessary the graceof God is to change men's hearts and lives. Love will do what fearcannot. Moses and Aaron interceded with God for mercy, knowing howgreat the provocation was. Aaron went, and burned incense between theliving and the dead, not to purify the air, but to pacify an offendedGod. As one tender of the life of every Israelite, Aaron made allpossible speed. We must render good for evil. Observe especially, thatAaron was a type of Christ. There is an infection of sin in the world,which only the cross and intercession of Jesus Christ can stay andremove. He enters the defiled and dying camp. He stands between thedead and the living; between the eternal Judge and the souls undercondemnation. We must have redemption through His blood, even theremission of sins. We admire the ready devotion of Aaron: shall we notbless and praise the unspeakable grace and love which filled theSaviour's heart, when he placed himself in our stead, and bought uswith his life? Greatly indeed hath God commended his love towards us,in that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us, Ro 5:8.
Num 17:1-7	<br>It is an instance of the grace of God, that, having wrought diversmiracles to punish sin, he would work one more to prevent it. Twelverods or staves were to be brought in. It is probable that they were thestaves which the princes used as ensigns of their authority; old drystaves, that had no sap in them. They were to expect that the rod ofthe tribe, or prince, whom God chose to the priesthood, should bud andblossom. Moses did not object that the matter was sufficiently settledalready; he did not undertake to determine it; but left the case beforethe Lord.
Num 17:8-13	<br>While all the other rods remained as they were. Aaron's rod became aliving branch. In some places there were buds, in others blossoms, inothers fruit, at the same time; all this was miraculous. Thus Aaron wasmanifested to be under the special blessing of Heaven. Fruitfulness isthe best evidence of a Divine call; and the plants of God's setting,and the boughs cut off them, will flourish. This rod was preserved, totake away the murmurings of the people, that they might not die. Thedesign of God, in all his providences, and in the memorials of them, isto take away sin. Christ was manifested to take away sin. Christ isexpressly called a rod out of the stem of Jesse: little prospect wasthere, according to human views, that he should ever flourish. But thedry rod revived and blossomed to the confusion of his adversaries. Thepeople cry, Behold, we die, we perish, we all perish! This was thelanguage of a repining people, quarrelling with the judgments of God,which by their own pride and obstinacy they brought upon themselves. Itis very wicked to fret against God when we are in affliction, and inour distress thus to trespass yet more. If we die, if we perish, it isof ourselves, and the blame will be upon our own heads. When Godjudges, he will overcome, and will oblige the most obstinate gainsayersto confess their folly. And how great are our mercies, that we have aclearer and a better dispensation, established upon better promises!
Num 18:1-7	<br>The people complained of their difficulty and peril in drawing near toGod. God here gives them to understand, that the priests should comenear for them. Aaron would see reason not to be proud of hispreferment, when he considered the great care and charge upon him. Benot high-minded, but fear. The greater the trust of work and power thatis committed to us, the greater danger there is of betraying thattrust. This is a good reason why we should neither envy others'honours, nor desire high places.
Num 18:8-19	<br>All believers are spiritual priests, and God has promised to take careof them. Godliness has the promise of the life that now is. And fromthe provision here made for the priests, the apostle shows that it isthe duty of christian churches to maintain their ministers. Scandalousmaintenance makes scandalous ministers. The priests were to be whollydevoted to their ministry, not diverted from it, or disturbed in it, byworldly care or business. Also, that they might be examples of livingby faith, not only in God's providence, but in his ordinances. The bestshould be offered for the first-fruits unto the Lord. Those who thinkto save, by putting God off with the refuse, deceive themselves, forGod is not mocked.
Num 18:20-32	<br>As Israel was a people not to be numbered among the nations, so Leviwas a tribe to be distinguished from the rest. Those who have God fortheir Inheritance and their Portion for ever, ought to look with holycontempt and indifference upon the possessions of this world. TheLevites were to give God his dues out of their tithes, as well as theIsraelites out of their increase. See, in 
Num 18:31), the way to havecomfort in all our worldly possessions, so as to bear no sin by reasonof them. 1. We must be sure that what we have is got honestly and inthe service of God. That meat is best eaten which is first earned; butif any will not work, neither shall he eat, 2Th 3:10. 2. We must besure that God has his dues out of it. We have the comfort of oursubstance, when we have honoured the Lord with it. Ye shall bear no sinby reason of it, when ye have heaved the best from it. We should givealms of such things as we have, that all may be holy and comfortable tous.	
Num 19:1-10	<br>The heifer was to be wholly burned. This typified the painfulsufferings of our Lord Jesus, both in soul and body, as a sacrificemade by fire, to satisfy God's justice for man's sin. These ashes aresaid to be laid up as a purification for sin, because, though they wereonly to purify from ceremonial uncleanness, yet they were a type ofthat purification for sin which our Lord Jesus made by his death. Theblood of Christ is laid up for us in the word and sacraments, as afountain of merit, to which by faith we may have constant recourse, forcleansing our consciences.
Num 19:11-22	<br>Why did the law make a corpse a defiling thing? Because death is thewages of sin, which entered into the world by it, and reigns by thepower of it. The law could not conquer death, nor abolish it, as thegospel does, by bringing life and immortality to light, and sointroducing a better hope. As the ashes of the heifer signified themerit of Christ, so the running water signified the power and grace ofthe blessed Spirit, who is compared to rivers of living water; and itis by his work that the righteousness of Christ is applied to us forour cleansing. Those who promise themselves benefit by therighteousness of Christ, while they submit not to the grace andinfluence of the Holy Spirit, do but deceive themselves; we cannot bepurified by the ashes, otherwise than in the running water. What usecould there be in these appointments, if they do not refer to thedoctrines concerning the sacrifice of Christ? But comparing them withthe New Testament, the knowledge to be got from them is evident. Thetrue state of fallen man is shown in these institutions. Here we learnthe defiling nature of sin, and are warned to avoid evilcommunications.
Num 20:1-13	<br>After thirty-eight years' tedious abode in the wilderness, the armiesof Israel advanced towards Canaan again. There was no water for thecongregation. We live in a wanting world, and wherever we are, mustexpect to meet with something to put us out. It is a great mercy tohave plenty of water, a mercy which, if we found the want of, we shouldmore own the worth of. Hereupon they murmured against Moses and Aaron.They spake the same absurd and brutish language their fathers had done.It made their crime the worse, that they had smarted so long for thediscontent and distrusts of their fathers, yet they venture in the samesteps. Moses must again, in God's name, command water out of a rock forthem; God is as able as ever to supply his people with what is needfulfor them. But Moses and Aaron acted wrong. They took much of the gloryof this work of wonder to themselves; "Must we fetch water?" As if itwere done by some power or worthiness of their own. They were to speakto the rock, but they smote it. Therefore it is charged upon them, thatthey did not sanctify God, that is, they did not give to him alone thatglory of this miracle which was due unto his name. And being provokedby the people, Moses spake unadvisedly with his lips. The same pride ofman would still usurp the office of the appointed Mediator; and becometo ourselves wisdom, righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption.Such a state of sinful independence, such a rebellion of the soulagainst its Saviour, the voice of God condemns in every page of thegospel.
Num 20:14-21	<br>The nearest way to Canaan from the place where Israel encamped, wasthrough the country of Edom. The ambassadors who were sent returnedwith a denial. The Edomites feared to receive damage by the Israelites.And had this numerous army been under any other discipline than that ofthe righteous God himself, there might have been cause for thisjealousy. But Esau hated Jacob because of the blessing; and now thehatred revived, when the blessing was about to be inherited. We mustnot think it strange, if reasonable requests be denied by unreasonablemen, and if those whom God favours be affronted by men.
Num 20:22-29	<br>God bids Aaron prepare to die. There is something of displeasure inthese orders. Aaron must not enter Canaan, because he had failed in hisduty at the waters of strife. There is much of mercy in them. Aaron,though he dies for his transgression, dies with ease, and in honour. Heis gathered to his people, as one who dies in the arms of Divine grace.There is much significancy in these orders. Aaron must not enterCanaan, to show that the Levitical priesthood could make nothingperfect; that must be done by bringing in a better hope. Aaron submits,and dies in the method and manner appointed; and, for aught thatappears, with as much cheerfulness as if he had been going to bed. Itwas a great satisfaction to Aaron to see his son, who was dear to him,preferred; and his office preserved and secured: especially, to see inthis a figure of Christ's everlasting priesthood. A good man woulddesire, if it were the will of God, not to outlive his usefulness. Whyshould we covet to continue any longer in this world, than while we maydo some service in it for God and our generation?
Num 21:1-3	<br>Before the people began their march round the country of Edom, the kingof Arad, a Canaanite, who inhabited the southern part of the country,attacked them in the wilderness, and took some prisoners. This was tolead the Israelites to look more thoroughly to the Lord.
Num 21:4-9	<br>The children of Israel were wearied by a long march round the land ofEdom. They speak discontentedly of what God had done for them, anddistrustfully of what he would do. What will they be pleased with, whommanna will not please? Let not the contempt which some cast on the wordof God, make us value it less. It is the bread of life, substantialbread, and will nourish those who by faith feed upon it, to eternallife, whoever may call it light bread. We see the righteous judgmentGod brought upon them for murmuring. He sent fiery serpents among them,which bit or stung many to death. It is to be feared that they wouldnot have owned the sin, if they had not felt the smart; but they relentunder the rod. And God made a wonderful provision for their relief. TheJews themselves say it was not the sight of the brazen serpent thatcured; but in looking up to it, they looked up to God as the Lord thathealed them. There was much gospel in this. Our Saviour declared, Joh3:14,15, that as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so theSon of man must be lifted up, that whatsoever believeth in him, shouldnot perish. Compare their disease and ours. Sin bites like a serpent,and stings like an adder. Compare the application of their remedy andours. They looked and lived, and we, if we believe, shall not perish.It is by faith that we look unto Jesus, Heb 12:2. Whosoever looked,however desperate his case, or feeble his sight, or distant his place,was certainly and perfectly cured. The Lord can relieve us from dangersand distresses, by means which human reason never would have devised.Oh that the venom of the old serpent, inflaming men's passions, andcausing them to commit sins which end in their eternal destruction,were as sensibly felt, and the danger as plainly seen, as theIsraelites felt pain from the bite of the fiery serpents, and fearedthe death which followed! Then none would shut their eyes to Christ, orturn from his gospel. Then a crucified Saviour would be so valued, thatall things else would be accounted loss for him; then, without delay,and with earnestness and simplicity, all would apply to him in theappointed way, crying, Lord, save us; we perish! Nor would any abusethe freeness of Christ's salvation, while they reckoned the price whichit cost him.
Num 21:10-20	<br>We have here the removes of the children of Israel, till they came tothe plains of Moab, from whence they passed over Jordan into Canaan.The end of their pilgrimage was near. "They set forward." It were wellif we did thus; and the nearer we come to heaven, were so much the moreactive and abundant in the work of the Lord. The wonderful success Godgranted to his people, is here spoken of, and, among the rest, theiractions on the river Arnon, at Vaheb in Suphah, and other places onthat river. In every stage of our lives, nay, in every step, we shouldnotice what God has wrought for us; what he did at such a time, andwhat in such a place, ought to be distinctly remembered. God blessedhis people with a supply of water. When we come to heaven, we shallremove to the well of life, the fountain of living waters. Theyreceived it with joy and thankfulness, which made the mercy doublysweet. With joy must we draw water out of the wells of salvation, Isa12:3. As the brazen serpent was a figure of Christ, who is lifted upfor our cure, so is this well a figure of the Spirit, who is pouredforth for our comfort, and from whom flow to us rivers of livingwaters, Joh 7:38,39. Does this well spring up in our souls? If so, weshould take the comfort to ourselves, and give the glory to God. Godpromised to give water, but they must open the ground. God's favoursmust be expected in the use of such means as are within our power, butstill the power is only of God.
Num 21:21-35	<br>Sihon went with his forces against Israel, out of his own borders,without provocation, and so ran upon his own ruin. The enemies of God'schurch often perish by the counsels they think most wisely taken. Og,king of Bashan, instead of being warned by the fate of his neighbours,to make peace with Israel, makes war with them, which proves in likemanner his destruction. Wicked men do their utmost to secure themselvesand their possessions against the judgments of God; but all in vain,when the day comes on which they must fall. God gave Israel success,while Moses was with them, that he might see the beginning of theglorious work, though he must not live to see it finished. This was, incomparison, but as the day of small things, yet it was an earnest ofgreat things. We must prepare for fresh conflicts and enemies. We mustmake no peace or truce with the powers of darkness, nor even treat withthem; nor should we expect any pause in our contest. But, trusting inGod, and obeying his commands, we shall be more than conquerors overevery enemy.
Num 22:1-14	<br>The king of Moab formed a plan to get the people of Israel cursed; thatis, to set God against them, who had hitherto fought for them. He had afalse notion, that if he could get some prophet to pray for evil uponthem, and to pronounce a blessing upon himself and his forces, thatthen he should be able to deal with them. None had so great areputation as Balaam; and Balak will employ him, though he send a greatway for him. It is not known whether the Lord had ever spoken toBalaam, or by him, before this; though it is probable he had, and it iscertain he did afterwards. Yet we have abundant proof that he lived anddied a wicked man, an enemy to God and his people. And the curse shallnot come upon us if there is not a cause, even though men utter it. Toprevail with Balaam, they took the wages of unrighteousness, but Godlaid restraint upon Balaam, forbidding him to curse Israel. Balaam wasno stranger to Israel's cause; so that he ought to have answered themessengers at once, that he would never curse a people whom God hadblessed; but he takes a night's time to consider what he should do.When we parley with temptations, we are in great danger of beingovercome. Balaam was not faithful in returning God's answer to themessengers. Those are a fair mark for Satan's temptation, who lessenDivine restraints; as if to go against God's law were only to gowithout his leave. The messengers also are not faithful in returningBalaam's answer to Balak. Thus many are abused by the flatteries ofthose about them, and are prevented from seeing their own faults andfollies.
Num 22:15-21	<br>A second embassy was sent to Balaam. It were well for us, if we were asearnest and constant in prosecuting a good work, notwithstandingdisappointments. Balak laid a bait, not only for Balaam's covetousness,but for his pride and ambition. How earnestly should we beg of Goddaily to mortify such desires in us! Thus sinners stick at no pains,spare no cost, and care not how low they stoop, to gratify theirluxury, or their malice. Shall we then be unwilling to do what isright? God forbid! Balaam's convictions charged him to keep to thecommand of God; nor could any man have spoken better. But many call Godtheirs, who are not his, not truly because not only his. There is nojudging men by their words; God knows the heart. Balaam's corruptionsat the same time inclined him to go contrary to the command. He seemedto refuse the temptation; but he expressed no abhorrence of it. He hada strong desire to accept the offer, and hoped that God might give himleave to go. He had already been told what the will of God was. It is acertain evidence of the ruling of corruption in the heart, to beg leaveto sin. God gave Balaam up to his own heart's lusts. As God sometimesdenies the prayers of his people in love, so sometimes he grants thedesires of the wicked in wrath.
Num 22:22-35	<br>We must not think, that because God does not always by his providencerestrain men from sin, therefore he approves of it, or that it is nothateful to him. The holy angels oppose sin, and perhaps are employed inpreventing it more than we are aware. This angel was an adversary toBalaam, because Balaam counted him his adversary; those are really ourbest friends, and we ought so to reckon them, who stop our progress insinful ways. Balaam has notice of God's displeasure by the ass. It iscommon for those whose hearts are fully set in them to do evil, to pushon violently, through the difficulties Providence lays in their way.The Lord opened the mouth of the ass. This was a great miracle wroughtby the power of God. He who made man speak, could, when he pleased,make the ass to speak with man's voice. The ass complained of Balaam'scruelty. The righteous God does not allow the meanest or weakest to beabused; but they shall be able to speak in their own defence, or hewill some way or other speak for them. Balaam at length has his eyesopened. God has many ways to bring down the hard and unhumbled heart.When our eyes are opened, we shall see the danger of sinful ways, andhow much it was for our advantage to be crossed. Balaam seemed torelent; I have sinned; but it does not appear that he was sensible ofthis wickedness of his heart, or willing to own it. If he finds hecannot go forward, he will be content, since there is no remedy, to goback. Thus many leave their sins, only because their sins have leftthem. The angel declared that he should not only be unable to curseIsrael, but should be forced to bless them: this would be more for theglory of God, and to his own confusion, than if he had turned back.
Num 22:36-41	<br>Balak has now nothing to complain of, but that Balaam did not comesooner. Balaam bids Balak not depend too much upon him. He seems tospeak with vexation; but is really as desirous to please Balak, as everhe had pretended to be to please God. See what need we have to prayevery day, Our Father which art in heaven, lead us not into temptation.Let us be jealous over our own hearts, seeing how far men may go in theknowledge of God, and yet come short of Divine grace.
Num 23:1-10	<br>With the camps of Israel full in view, Balaam ordered seven altars tobe built, and a bullock and a ram to be offered on each. Oh thesottishness of superstition, to imagine that God will be at man's beck!The curse is turned into a blessing, by the overruling power of God, inlove to Israel. God designed to serve his own glory by Balaam, andtherefore met him. If God put a word into the mouth of Balaam, whowould have defied God and Israel, surely he will not be wanting tothose who desire to glorify God, and to edify his people; it shall begiven what they should speak. He who opened the mouth of the ass,caused the mouth of this wicked man to speak words as contrary to thedesire of his heart, as those of the ass were to the powers of thebrute. The miracle was as great in the one case as in the other. Balaampronounces Israel safe. He owns he could do no more than God sufferedhim to do. He pronounces them happy in their distinction from the restof the nations. Happy in their numbers, which made them both honourableand formidable. Happy in their last end. Death is the end of all men;even the righteous must die, and it is good for us to think of thiswith regard to ourselves, as Balaam does here, speaking of his owndeath. He pronounces the righteous truly blessed, not only while theylive, but when they die; which makes their death even more desirablethan life itself. But there are many who desire to die the death of therighteous, but do not endeavour to live the life of the righteous;gladly would they have an end like theirs, but not a way like theirs.They would be saints in heaven, but not saints on earth. This saying ofBalaam's is only a wish, not a prayer; it is a vain wish, being only awish for the end, without any care for the means. Many seek to quiettheir consciences with the promise of future amendment, or take up withsome false hope, while they neglect the only way of salvation, by whicha sinner can be righteous before God.
Num 23:11-30	<br>Balak was angry with Balaam. Thus a confession of God's overrulingpower is extorted from a wicked prophet, to the confusion of a wickedprince. A second time the curse is turned into a blessing; and thisblessing is both larger and stronger than the former. Men change theirminds, and break their words; but God never changes his mind, andtherefore never recalls his promise. And when in Scripture he is saidto repent, it does not mean any change of his mind; but only a changeof his way. There was sin in Jacob, and God saw it; but there was notsuch as might provoke him to give them up to ruin. If the Lord seesthat we trust in his mercy, and accept of his salvation; that weindulge no secret lust, and continue not in rebellion, but endeavour toserve and glorify him; we may be sure that he looks upon us as acceptedin Christ, that our sins are all pardoned. Oh the wonders of providenceand grace, the wonders of redeeming love, of pardoning mercy, of thenew-creating Spirit! Balak had no hope of ruining Israel, and Balaamshowed that he had more reason to fear being ruined by them. SinceBalaam cannot say what he would have him, Balak wished him to saynothing. But though there are many devices in man's heart, God'scounsels shall stand. Yet they resolve to make another attempt, thoughthey had no promise on which to build their hopes. Let us, who have apromise that the vision at the end shall speak and not lie, continueearnest in prayer, Lu 18:1.
Num 24:1-9	<br>Now Balaam spake not his own sense, but the language of the Spirit thatcame upon him. Many have their eyes open who have not their heartsopen; are enlightened, but not sanctified. That knowledge which puffsmen up with pride, will but serve to light them to hell, whither manygo with their eyes open. The blessing is nearly the same as those givenbefore. He admires in Israel, their beauty. The righteous, doubtless,is more excellent than his neighbour. Their fruitfulness and increase.Their honour and advancement. Their power and victory. He looks backupon what had been done for them. Their power and victory. He looksback upon what had been done for them. Their courage and security. Therighteous are bold as a lion, not when assaulting others, but when atrest, because God maketh them to dwell in safety. Their influence upontheir neighbours. God takes what is done to them, whether good or evil,as done to himself. (Nu 24:10-14)
Num 24:10-14	<br>This vain attempt to curse Israel is ended. Balak broke out into a rageagainst Balaam, and expressed great vexation. Balaam has a very fullexcuse; God restrained him from saying what he would have said, andconstrained him to say what he would not have uttered.
Num 24:15-25	<br>Under the powerful influence of the Spirit of prophecy, Balaam foretoldthe future prosperity and extensive dominion of Israel. Balaam boaststhat his eyes are open. The prophets were in old times called seers. Hehad heard the words of God, which many do who neither heed them, norhear God in them. He knew the knowledge of the Most High. A man may befull of the knowledge of God, yet utterly destitute of the grace ofGod. He calls God the Most High and the Almighty. No man could seem toexpress a greater respect to God; yet he had no true fear of him, loveto him, nor faith in him; so far a man may go toward heaven, and yetcome short of it at last. Here is Balaam's prophecy concerning Him whoshould be the crown and glory of his people Israel; who is David in thetype; but our Lord Jesus, the promised Messiah, is chiefly pointed at,and of him it is an illustrious prophecy. Balaam, a wicked man, shallsee Christ, but shall not see him nigh; not see him as Job, who saw himas his Redeemer, and saw him for himself. When he comes in the clouds,every eye shall see him; but many will see him, as the rich man in hellsaw Abraham, afar off. He shall come out of Jacob, and Israel, as aStar and a Sceptre; the former denoting his glory and lustre; thelatter his power and authority. Christ shall be King, not only of Jacoband Israel, but of all the world; so that all shall be either governedby his golden sceptre, or dashed in pieces by his iron rod. Balaamprophesied concerning the Amalekites and Kenites, part of whose countryhe had now in view. Even a nest in a rock will not be a lastingsecurity. Here is a prophecy that looks as far forward as to the Greeksand Romans. He acknowledges all the revolutions of states and kingdomsto be the Lord's doing. These events will make such desolations, thatscarcely any will escape. They that live then, will be as brandsplucked out of the fire. May God fit us for the worst of times! ThusBalaam, instead of cursing the church, curses Amalek the first, andRome the last enemy of the church. Not Rome pagan only, but Rome papalalso; antichrist and all the antichristian powers. Let us askourselves, Do we in knowledge, experience, or profession, excel Balaam?No readiness of speech, even in preaching or prayer, no gifts ofknowledge or prophecy, are in themselves different from, or superior tothe boasted gifts of him who loved the wages of unrighteousness, anddied the enemy of God. Simple dependence on the Redeemer's atoningblood and sanctifying grace, cheerful submission to the Divine will,constant endeavours to glorify God and benefit his people, these areless splendid, but far more excellent gifts, and always accompanysalvation. No boasting hypocrite ever possessed these; yet the feeblestbeliever has something of them, and is daily praying for more of them.
Num 25:1-5	<br>The friendship of the wicked is more dangerous than their enmity; fornone can prevail against God's people if they are not overcome by theirinbred lusts; nor can any enchantment hurt them, but the enticements ofworldly interests and pleasures. Here is the sin of Israel, to whichthey are enticed by the daughters of Moab and Midian. Those are ourworst enemies who draw us to sin, for that is the greatest mischief anyman can do us. Israel's sin did that which all Balaam's enchantmentscould not do; it set God against them. Diseases are the fruits of God'sanger, and the just punishments of prevailing sins; one infectionfollows the other. Ringleaders in sin ought to be made examples ofjustice.
Num 25:6-15	<br>Phinehas, in the courage of zeal and faith, executed vengeance on Zimriand Cozbi. This act can never be an example for private revenge, orreligious persecution, or for irregular public vengeance.
Num 25:16-18	<br>We read not that any Midianites died of the plague; God punished themwith the sword of an enemy, not with the rod of a father. We must setourselves against whatever is an occasion of sin to us, Mt 5:29,30.Whatever draws us to sin, should be a vexation to us, as a thorn in theflesh. And none will be more surely and severely punished than thosewho, after Satan's example, and with his subtlety, tempt others to sin.
Num 26:1-51	<br>Moses did not number the people but when God commanded him. We havehere the families registered, as well as the tribes. The total wasnearly the same as when numbered at mount Sinai. Notice is here takenof the children of Korah; they died not, as the children of Dathan andAbiram; they seem not to have joined even their own father inrebellion. If we partake not of the sins of sinners, we shall notpartake of their plagues. (Nu 26:52-56)
Num 26:52-56	<br>In distributing these tribes, the general rule of equity is prescribed;that to many should be given more, and to fewer less. Though it seemsleft to the prudence of their prince, the matter at last must besettled by the providence of God, with which all must be satisfied.
Num 26:57-62	<br>Levi was God's tribe; therefore it was not numbered with the rest, butalone. It came not under the sentence, that none of them should enterCanaan excepting Caleb and Joshua.
Num 26:63-65	<br>The execution of the sentence passed on the murmurers, chap. 14:29, isobservable. There was not one man numbered now, who was numbered then,but Caleb and Joshua. Here appeared the righteousness of God, and hisfaithfulness to his threatenings. Especially observe the truth of God,in performing his promise to Caleb and Joshua. Death makes awful havocof the human species, and causes surprising changes in families andnations; yet all is appointed in perfect wisdom, justice, and truth, bythe Lord himself. This should stir us up to think upon the hatefulnature of sin, the cause of all these devastations. We should renew ourrepentance, seek forgiveness, value the salvation of Christ, rememberhow frail we are, prepare for the summons of death, and fill up ourdays in serving our generation according to the will of God.
Num 27:1-11	<br>The five daughters of Zelophehad considered themselves as leftdestitute, having neither father nor brother to inherit any land. Theirbelieving expectation that the word of the Lord would be performed indue season, and their desire of an interest in the promisedinheritance; and the modest, candid manner in which they asked, withoutsecret murmurs or discontents, are a good example. They ask for apossession in the land of Canaan. Herein they discovered, 1. Strongfaith in the power and promise of God, concerning the giving of theland of Canaan to Israel. 2. And earnest desire of a place and name inthe land of promise, which was a type of heaven. 3. Respect and honourfor their father, whose name was dear to them now he was gone. He neverhad done any thing that might bar his children's claim. It is a comfortto parents when they come to die, if though they have smarted for theirown sin, yet they are not conscious of any of those iniquities whichGod will visit on their children. God himself gives judgment. He takesnotice of the affairs, not only of nations, but of private families,and orders them according to his will. The petition is granted. Thosewho seek an inheritance in the land of promise, shall have what theyseek for, and other things shall be added to them.
Num 27:12-14	<br>Moses must die, but he shall have the satisfaction of seeing the landof promise. This sight of Canaan signified his believing prospect ofthe better country, that is, the heavenly. Moses must die, but deathdoes not cut him off; it only brings him to rest with the holypatriarchs. It is but to die as they died, having lived as they lived;and as their end was peace, why should we fear any evil in the passageof that dark valley? (Nu 27:15-23)
Num 27:15-23	<br>Envious spirits do not love their successors; but Moses was not one ofthese. We should concern ourselves, both in our prayers and in ourendeavours, for the rising generation, that religion may be maintainedand advanced, when we are in our graves. God appoints a successor, evenJoshua; who had signalized himself by his courage in fighting Amalek,his humility in ministering to Moses, and his faith and sincerity inwitnessing against the report of the evil spies. This man God appointsto succeed Moses; a man in whom is the Spirit, the Spirit of grace. Heis a good man, fearing God and hating covetousness, and acting fromprinciple. He has the spirit of government; he is fit to do the workand discharge the trusts of his place. He has a spirit of conduct andcourage; he had also the Spirit of prophecy. That man is not fullyqualified for any service in the church of Christ, who is destitute ofthe graces and gifts of the Holy Spirit, whatever human abilities hemay possess. And in Joshua's succession we are reminded "that the lawwas given by Moses," who by reason of our transgression could not bringus to heaven; but "grace and truth came by Jesus Christ," for thesalvation of every believer.
Num 28:1-8	<br>God saw fit now to repeat the law of sacrifices. This was a newgeneration of men; and they were concerned to keep their peace with Godwhen at war with their enemies. The daily sacrifice is called acontinual burnt-offering; when we are bid to pray always, at leastevery morning and evening we should offer up solemn prayers and praisesto God. Nothing is added here but that the wine poured out in thedrink-offering is to be strong wine, to teach us to serve God with thebest we have. It was a figure of the blood of Christ, the memorial ofwhich is still left to the church in wine; and of the blood of themartyrs, which was poured out as a drink-offering on the sacrifice andservice of our faith, Php 2:17.
Num 28:9-15	<br>Every sabbath day, beside the two lambs offered for the dailyburnt-offering, there must be two more offered. This teaches us todouble our devotions on sabbath days, for so the duty of the dayrequires. The sabbath rest is to be observed, in order more closely toapply ourselves to the sabbath work, which ought to fill up the sabbathtime. The offerings in the new moons showed thankfulness for therenewing of earthly blessings: when we rejoice in the gifts ofprovidence, we must make the sacrifice of Christ, that great gift ofspecial grace, the fountain and spring-head of our joy. And the worshipperformed in the new moons is made typical of gospel solemnities, Isa66:23. As the moon borrows light from the sun, and is renewed by itsinfluences; so the church borrows her light from Jesus Christ, who isthe Sun of righteousness, renewing the state of the church, especiallyunder the gospel. (Nu 28:16-31)
Num 28:16-31	<br>By the sacrifices enjoined in this chapter, we are reminded of thecontinued power of the sacrifice of Christ, and of our continual needto depend thereon. No hurrying employments, or perilous situations, orprosperous circumstances, should cause slackness in our religiousexercises; but should rather stir us up to greater diligence in seekinghelp from, or giving thanks to the Lord. And all is to be accompaniedwith repentance, faith is the Lord Jesus, and love to him, and toproduce true holiness in our conduct towards all men; otherwise Godwill abhor our most solemn services and abundant devotions. And Christis able to supply the wants of every day, every week, every month,every year, every ordinance, every case.
Num 29:1-11	<br>There were more sacred solemnities in the seventh month than in anyother. It was the space between harvest and seed-time. The more leisurewe have from the pressing occupations of this life, the more time weshould spend in the immediate service of God. The blowing of thetrumpets was appointed, Le 22:24. Here they are directed whatsacrifices to offer on that day. Those who would know the mind of Godin the Scriptures, must compare one part with another. The latterdiscoveries of Divine light explain what was dark, and supply what waswanting, in the former, that the man of God may be perfect.
Num 29:12-40	<br>Soon after the day of atonement, the day in which men were to afflicttheir souls, followed the feast of Tabernacles, in which they were torejoice before the Lord. Their days of rejoicing were to be days ofsacrifices. A disposition to be cheerful does us good, when itencourages our hearts in the duties of God's service. All the days ofdwelling in booths they must offer sacrifices; while we are here in atabernacle state, it is our interest, as well as our duty, constantlyto keep up communion with God. The sacrifices for each of the sevendays are appointed. Every day there must be a sin-offering, as in theother feasts. Our burnt-offerings of praise cannot be accepted of God,unless we have an interest in the great sacrifice which Christ offered,when he made himself a Sin-offering for us. And no extraordinaryservices should put aside stated devotions. Every thing here reminds usof our sinfulness. The life that we live in the flesh must be by thefaith of the Son of God; until we go to be with him, to behold hisglory, and praise his mercy, who hath loved us and washed us from oursins in his own blood. To whom be honour and glory for ever. Amen.
Num 30:1,2	<br>No man can be bound by his own promise to do what he is already, by theDivine precept, forbidden to do. In other matters the command is, thathe shall not break his words, through he may change his mind.
Num 30:3-16	<br>Two cases of vows are determined. The case of a daughter in herfather's house. When her vow comes to his knowledge, it is in his powereither to confirm it or do it away. The law is plain in the case of awife. If her husband allows her vow, though only by silence, it stands.If he disallows it, her obligation to her husband takes place of it;for to him she ought to be in subjection, as unto the Lord. The Divinelaw consults the good order of families. It is fit that every manshould bear rule in his own house, and have his wife and children insubjection; rather than that this great rule should be broken, or anyencouragement be given to inferior relations to break those bondsasunder, God releases the obligation even of a solemn vow. So much doesreligion secure the welfare of all societies; and in it the families ofthe earth have a blessing.
Num 31:1-6	<br>All who, without commission from God, dare to execute private revenge,and who, from ambition, covetousness, or resentment, wage war anddesolate kingdoms, must one day answer for it. But if God, instead ofsending an earthquake, a pestilence, or a famine, be pleased toauthorize and command any people to avenge his cause, such a commissionsurely is just and right. The Israelites could show such a commission,though no persons now can do so. Their wars were begun and carried onexpressly by Divine direction, and they were enabled to conquer bymiracles. Unless it can be proved that the wicked Canaanites did notdeserve their doom, objectors only prove their dislike to God, andtheir love to his enemies. Man makes light of the evil of sin, but Godabhors it. This explains the terrible executions of the nations whichhad filled the measure of their sins.
Num 31:7-12	<br>The Israelites slew the Kings of Midian. They slew Balaam. God'soverruling providence brought him thither, and their just vengeancefound him. Had he himself rightly believed what he had said of thehappy state of Israel, he would not have thus herded with the enemiesof Israel. The Midianites' wicked wiles were Balaam's projects: it wasjust that he should perish with them, Ho 4:5. They took the women andchildren captives. They burnt their cities and castles, and returned tothe camp.
Num 31:13-18	<br>The sword of war should spare women and children; but the sword ofjustice should know no distinction, but that of guilty or not guilty.This war was the execution of a righteous sentence upon a guiltynation, in which the women were the worst criminals. The femalechildren were spared, who, being brought up among the Israelites, wouldnot tempt them to idolatry. The whole history shows the hatefulness ofsin, and the guilt of tempting others; it teaches us to avoid alloccasions of evil, and to give no quarter to inward lusts. The womenand children were not kept for sinful purposes, but for slaves, acustom every where practised in former times, as to captives. In thecourse of providence, when famine and plagues visit a nation for sin,children suffer in the common calamity. In this case parents arepunished in their children; and for children dying before actual sin,full provision is made as to their eternal happiness, by the mercy ofGod in Christ.
Num 31:19-24	<br>The Israelites had to purify themselves according to the law, and toabide without the camp seven days, though they had not contracted anymoral guilt, the war being just and lawful, and commanded by God. ThusGod would preserve in their minds a dread and detestation of sheddingblood. The spoil had been used by Midianites, and being now come intothe possession of Israelites, it was fit that it should be purified.
Num 31:25-47	<br>Whatever we have, God justly claims a part. Out of the people's shareGod required one in fifty, but out of the soldiers' share only one infive hundred. The less opportunity we have of honouring God withpersonal services, the more should we give in money or value.
Num 31:48-54	<br>The success of the Israelites had been very remarkable, so small acompany overcoming such multitudes, but it was still more wonderfulthat not one was slain or missing. They presented the gold they foundamong the spoils, as an offering to the Lord. Thus they confessed, thatinstead of claiming a reward for their service, they needed forgivenessof much that had been amiss, and desired to be thankful for thepreservation of their lives, which might justly have been taken away.
Num 32:1-5	<br>Here is a proposal made by the Reubenites and Gadites, that the landlately conquered might be allotted to them. Two things common in theworld might lead these tribes to make this choice; the lust of the eye,and the pride of life. There was much amiss in the principle they wentupon; they consulted their own private convenience more than the publicgood. Thus to the present time, many seek their own things more thanthe things of Jesus Christ; and are led by worldly interests andadvantages to take up short of the heavenly Canaan.
Num 32:6-15	<br>The proposal showed disregard to the land of Canaan, distrust of theLord's promise, and unwillingness to encounter the difficulties anddangers of conquering and driving out the inhabitants of that land.Moses is wroth with them. It will becomes any of God's Israel to sitdown unconcerned about the difficult and perilous concerns of theirbrethren, whether public or personal. He reminds them of the fatalconsequences of the unbelief and faint-heartedness of their fathers,when they were, as themselves, just ready to enter Canaan. If menconsidered as they ought what would be the end of sin, they would beafraid of the beginning of it.
Num 32:16-27	<br>Here is the good effect of plain dealing. Moses, by showing their sin,and the danger of it, brought them to their duty, without murmuring ordisputing. All men ought to consider the interests of others as well astheir own; the law of love requires us to labour, venture, or sufferfor each other as there may be occasion. They propose that their men ofwar should go ready armed before the children of Israel into the landof Canaan, and that they should not return till the conquest of Canaanwas ended. Moses grants their request, but he warns them of the dangerof breaking their word. If you fail, you sin against the Lord, and notagainst your brethren only; God will certainly reckon with you for it.Be sure your sin will find you out. Sin will surely find out the sinnersooner or later. It concerns us now to find our sins out, that we mayrepent of them, and forsake them, lest they find us out to our ruin.
Num 32:28-42	<br>Concerning the settlement of these tribes, observe, that they built thecities, that is, repaired them. They changed the names of them;probably they were idolatrous, therefore they should be forgotten. Aspirit of selfishness, of seeking our own, not the things of Christ,when each one ought to assist others, is as dangerous as it is common.It is impossible to be sincere in the faith, sensible of the goodnessof God, constrained by the love of Christ, sanctified by the power ofthe Holy Ghost, and yet be indifferent to the progress of religion, andthe spiritual success of others, through love of ease, or fear ofconflict. Let then your light so shine before men, that they may seeyour good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven.
Num 33:1-49	<br>This is a brief review of the travels of the children of Israel throughthe wilderness. It is a memorable history. In their travels towardsCanaan they were continually on the remove. Such is our state in thisworld; we have here no continuing city, and all our removes in thisworld are but from one part a desert to another. They were led to andfro, forward and backward, yet were all the while under the directionof the pillar of cloud and fire. God led them about, yet led them theright way. The way God takes in bringing his people to himself isalways the best way, though it does not always seem to us the nearestway. Former events are mentioned. Thus we ought to keep in mind theprovidences of God concerning us and families, us and our land, and themany instances of that Divine care which has led us, and fed us, andkept us all our days hitherto. Few periods of our lives can be thoughtupon, without reminding us of the Lord's goodness, and our owningratitude and disobedience: his kindness leaves us without excuse forour sins. We could not wish to travel over again the stages we havepassed, unless we could hope, by the grace of God, to shun the sins wethen committed, and to embrace such opportunities of doing good as wehave let slip. Soon will our wanderings end, and our eternal state befixed beyond recall; how important then is the present moment! Happyare those whom the Lord now guides with his counsel, and will at lengthreceive to his glory. To this happiness the gospel calls us. Behold nowis the accepted time, now is the day of salvation. Let sinners seizethe opportunity, and flee for refuge to the hope set before them. Letus redeem our time, to glorify God and serve our generation; and hewill carry us safely through all, to his eternal kingdom.
Num 33:50-56	<br>Now that they were to pass over Jordan, they were entering again intotemptation to follow idols; and they are threatened that, if theyspared either the idols or the idolaters, their sin would certainly betheir punishment. They would foster vipers in their own bosoms. Theremnant of the Canaanites, if they made any peace with them, though butfor a time, would be pricks in their eyes, and thorns in their sides.We must expect trouble and affliction from whatever sin we indulge;that which we are willing should tempt us, will vex us. It was intendedthat the Canaanites should be put out of the land; but if theIsraelites learned their wicked ways, they also would be put out. Letus hear this and fear. If we do not drive out sin, sin will drive usout. If we are not the death of our lusts, our lusts will be the deathof our souls.
Num 34:1-15	<br>Canaan was of small extent; as it is here bounded, it is but about 160miles in length, and about 50 in breadth; yet this was the countrypromised to the father of the faithful, and the possession of the seedof Israel. This was that little spot of ground, in which alone, formany ages, God was known. This was the vineyard of the Lord, the gardenenclosed; but as it is with gardens and vineyards, the narrowness ofthe space was made up by the fruitfulness of the soil. Though the earthis the Lord's, and the fulness thereof, yet few know him, and servehim; but those few are happy, because fruitful to God. Also, see howlittle a share of the world God gives to his own people. Those who havetheir portion in heaven, have reason to be content with a smallpittance of this earth. Yet a little that a righteous man has, havingit from the love of God, and with his blessing, is far better and morecomfortable than the riches of many wicked. (Nu 34:16-29)
Num 34:16-29	<br>God here appoints men to divide the land to them. So sure must theyfeel of victory and success while God fought for them, that the personsare named who should be intrusted with the dividing of the land.
Num 35:1-8	<br>The cities of the priests and Levites were not only to accommodatethem, but to place them, as religious teachers, in several parts of theland. For though the typical service of the tabernacle or temple wasonly in one place, the preaching of the word of God, and prayer andpraise, were not thus confined. These cities were to be given out ofeach tribe. Each thus made a grateful acknowledgement to God. Eachtribe had the benefit of the Levites dwelling amongst them, to teachthem the knowledge of the Lord; thus no parts of the country were leftto sit in darkness. The gospel provides that he who is taught in theword, should communicate to him that teaches, in all good things, Ga6:6. We are to free God's ministers from distracting cares, and toleave them at leisure for the duties of their station; so that they maybe wholly employed therein, and avail themselves of every opportunity,by acts of kindness, to gain the good-will of the people, and to drawtheir attention.
Num 35:9-34	<br>To show plainly the abhorrence of murder, and to provide the moreeffectually for the punishment of the murderer, the nearest relation ofthe deceased, under the title of avenger of blood, (or the redeemer ofblood,) in notorious cases, might pursue, and execute vengeance. Adistinction is made, not between sudden anger and malice aforethought,both which are the crime of murder; but between intentionally strikinga man with any weapon likely to cause death, and an unintentional blow.In the latter case alone, the city of refuge afforded protection.Murder in all its forms, and under all disguises, pollutes a land.Alas! that so many murders, under the name of duels, prize-fights, &c.should pass unpunished. There were six cities of refuge; one or othermight be reached in less than a day's journey from any part of theland. To these, man-slayers might flee for refuge, and be safe, tillthey had a fair trial. If acquitted from the charge, they wereprotected from the avenger of blood; yet they must continue within thebounds of the city till the death of the high priest. Thus we arereminded that the death of the great High Priest is the only meanswhereby sins are pardoned, and sinners set at liberty. These cities areplainly alluded to, both in the Old and New Testament, we cannot doubtthe typical character of their appointment. Turn ye to the strong hold,ye prisoners of hope, saith the voice of mercy, Zec 9:12, alluding tothe city of refuge. St. Paul describes the strong consolation offleeing for refuge to the hope set before us, in a passage alwaysapplied to the gracious appointment of the cities of refuge, Heb 6:18.The rich mercies of salvation, through Christ, prefigured by thesecities, demand our regard. 1. Did the ancient city rear its towers ofsafety on high? See Christ raised up on the cross; and is he notexalted at the right hand of his Father, to be a Prince and a Saviour,to give repentance and remission of sins? 2. Does not the highway ofsalvation, resemble the smooth and plain path to the city of refuge?Survey the path that leads to the Redeemer. Is there anystumbling-block to be found therein, except that which an evil heart ofunbelief supplies for its own fall? 3. Waymarks were set up pointing tothe city. And is it not the office of the ministers of the gospel todirect sinners to Him? 4. The gate of the city stood open night andday. Has not Christ declared, Him that cometh unto me I will in nowisecast out? 5. The city of refuge afforded support to every one whoentered its walls. Those who have reached the refuge, may live by faithon Him whose flesh is meat indeed, and whose blood is drink indeed. 6.The city was a refuge for all. In the gospel there is no respect ofpersons. That soul lives not which deserves not Divine wrath; that soullives not which may not in simple faith hope for salvation and lifeeternal, through the Son of God.
Num 36:1-4	<br>The heads of the tribe of Manasseh represent the evil which mightfollow, if the daughters of Zelophehad should marry into any othertribes. They sought to preserve the Divine appointment of inheritances,and that contests and quarrels should not rise among those who shouldcome afterwards. It is the wisdom and duty of those who have estates inthe world, to settle them, and to dispose of them, so that no strifeand contention may arise. (Nu 36:5-12)
Num 36:5-12	<br>Those who consult the oracles of God, concerning the making of theirheavenly inheritance sure, shall not only be directed what to do, buttheir inquiries shall be graciously accepted. God would not have onetribe enriched at the expense of another. Each tribe was to keep to itsown inheritance. The daughters of Zelophehad submitted to thisappointment. How could they fail to marry well, when God himselfdirected them? Let the people of God learn how suitable and proper itis, like the daughters of Israel, to be united only to their ownpeople. Ought not every true believer Israel, to be united only totheir own people. Ought not every true believer in Jesus, to be veryattentive in the near and tender relations of life, to be united onlyto such as are united to the Lord? All our intentions and inclinationsought to be subjected to the will of God, when that is made known tous, and especially in contracting marriage. Although the word of Godallows affection and preference in this important relation, it does notsanction that foolish, ungovernable, and idolatrous passion, whichcares not what may be the end; but in defiance of authority, determinesupon self-gratification. All such conduct, however disguised, isagainst common sense, the interests of society, the happiness of themarriage relation, and, what is still more evil, against the religionof Christ.<br>Verse 13<br>These are the judgments the Lord commanded in the plains of Moab. Mostof them related to the settlement in Canaan, into which the Israeliteswere now entering. Whatever new condition God, by his providence,brings us into, we must beg him to teach us the duties of it, and toenable us to do them, that we may do the work of the day in its day,the duty of a place in its place.
Deu 1:1-8	<br>Moses spake to the people all the Lord had given him in commandment.Horeb was but eleven days distant from Kadesh-barnea. This was toremind them that their own bad conduct had occasioned their tediouswanderings; that they might the more readily understand the advantagesof obedience. They must now go forward. Though God brings his peopleinto trouble and affliction, he knows when they have been tried longenough. When God commands us to go forward in our Christian course, hesets the heavenly Canaan before us for our encouragement.
Deu 1:9-18	<br>Moses reminds the people of the happy constitution of their government,which might make them all safe and easy, if it was not their own fault.He owns the fulfilment of God's promise to Abraham, and prays for thefurther accomplishment of it. We are not straitened in the power andgoodness of God; why should we be straitened in our own faith and hope?Good laws were given to the Israelites, and good men were to see to theexecution of them, which showed God's goodness to them, and the care ofMoses.
Deu 1:19-46	<br>Moses reminds the Israelites of their march from Horeb toKadesh-barnea, through that great and terrible wilderness. He shows hownear they were to a happy settlement in Canaan. It will aggravate theeternal ruin of hypocrites, that they were not far from the kingdom ofGod. As if it were not enough that they were sure of their God beforethem, they would send men before them. Never any looked into the HolyLand, but they must own it to be a good land. And was there any causeto distrust this God? An unbelieving heart was at the bottom of allthis. All disobedience to God's laws, and distrust of his power andgoodness, flow from disbelief of his word, as all true obediencesprings from faith. It is profitable for us to divide our past livesinto distinct periods; to give thanks to God for the mercies we havereceived in each, to confess and seek the forgiveness of all the sinswe can remember; and thus to renew our acceptance of God's salvation,and our surrender of ourselves to his service. Our own plans seldomavail to good purpose; while courage in the exercise of faith, and inthe path of duty, enables the believer to follow the Lord fully, todisregard all that opposes, to triumph over all opposition, and to takefirm hold upon the promised blessings.
Deu 2:1-7	<br>Only a short account of the long stay of Israel in the wilderness isgiven. God not only chastised them for their murmuring and unbelief,but prepared them for Canaan; by humbling them for sin, teaching themto mortify their lusts, to follow God, and to comfort themselves inhim. Though Israel may be long kept waiting for deliverance andenlargement, it will come at last. Before God brought Israel to destroytheir enemies in Canaan, he taught them to forgive their enemies inEdom. They must not, under pretence of God's covenant and conduct,think to seize all they could lay hands on. Dominion is not founded ingrace. God's Israel shall be well placed, but must not expect to beplaced alone in the midst of the earth. Religion must never be made acloak for injustice. Scorn to be beholden to Edomites, when thou hastan all-sufficient God to depend upon. Use what thou hast, use itcheerfully. Thou hast experienced the care of the Divine providence,never use any crooked methods for thy supply. All this is equally to beapplied to the experience of the believer.
Deu 2:8-23	<br>We have the origin of the Moabites, Edomites, and Ammonites. Moses alsogives an instance older than any of these; the Caphtorims drove theAvims out of their country. These revolutions show what uncertainthings wordly possessions are. It was so of old, and ever will be so.Families decline, and from them estates are transferred to familiesthat increase; so little continuance is there in these things. This isrecorded to encourage the children of Israel. If the providence of Godhas done this for Moabites and Ammonites, much more would his promisedo it for Israel, his peculiar people. Cautions are given not to meddlewith Moabites and Ammonites. Even wicked men must not be wronged. Godgives and preserves outward blessings to wicked men; these are not thebest things, he has better in store for his own children.
Deu 2:24-37	<br>God tried his people, by forbidding them to meddle with the richcountries of Moab and Ammon. He gives them possession of the country ofthe Amorites. If we keep from what God forbids, we shall not lose byour obedience. The earth is the Lord's and the fulness thereof; and hegives it to whom he pleases; but when there is no express direction,none can plead his grant for such proceedings. Though God assured theIsraelites that the land should be their own, yet they must contendwith the enemy. What God gives we must endeavour to get. What a newworld did Israel now come into! Much more joyful will the change be,which holy souls will experience, when they remove out of thewilderness of this world to the better country, that is, the heavenly,to the city that has foundations. Let us, by reflecting upon God'sdealings with his people Israel, be led to meditate upon our yearsspent in vanity, through our transgressions. But happy are those whomJesus has delivered from the wrath to come. To whom he hath given theearnest of his Spirit in their hearts. Their inheritance cannot beaffected by revolutions of kingdoms, or changes in earthly possessions.
Deu 3:1-11	<br>Og was very powerful, but he did not take warning by the ruin of Sihon,and desire conditions of peace. He trusted his own strength, and so washardened to his destruction. Those not awakened by the judgments of Godon others, ripen for the like judgments on themselves.
Deu 3:12-20	<br>This country was settled on the Reubenites, Gadites, and half the tribeof Manasseh: see Nu 32. Moses repeats the condition of the grant towhich they agreed. When at rest, we should desire to see our brethrenat rest too, and should be ready to do what we can towards it; for weare not born for ourselves, but are members one of another.
Deu 3:21-29	<br>Moses encouraged Joshua, who was to succeed him. Thus the aged andexperienced in the service of God, should do all they can to strengthenthe hands of those who are young, and setting out in religion. Considerwhat God has done, what God has promised. If God be for us, who can beagainst us, so as to prevail? We reproach our Leader if we follow himtrembling. Moses prayed, that, if it were God's will, he might gobefore Israel, over Jordan into Canaan. We should never allow anydesires in our hearts, which we cannot in faith offer up to God byprayer. God's answer to this prayer had a mixture of mercy andjudgment. God sees it good to deny many things we desire. He may acceptour prayers, yet not grant us the very things we pray for. It God doesnot by his providence give us what we desire, yet if by his grace hemakes us content without, it comes to much the same. Let it sufficethee to have God for thy Father, and heaven for thy portion, thoughthou hast not every thing thou wouldst have in the world. God promisedMoses a sight of Canaan from the top of Pisgah. Though he should nothave the possession of it, he should have the prospect of it. Evengreat believers, in this present state, see heaven but at a distance.God provided him a successor. It is a comfort to the friends of thechurch of Christ, to see God's work likely to be carried on by others,when they are silent in the dust. And if we have the earnest andprospect of heaven, let these suffice us; let us submit to the Lord'swill, and speak no more to Him of matters which he sees good to refuseus.
Deu 4:1-23	<br>The power and love of God to Israel are here made the ground and reasonof a number of cautions and serious warnings; and although there ismuch reference to their national covenant, yet all may be applied tothose who live under the gospel. What are laws made for but to beobserved and obeyed? Our obedience as individuals cannot meritsalvation; but it is the only evidence that we are partakers of thegift of God, which is eternal life through Jesus Christ, Consideringhow many temptations we are compassed with, and what corrupt desires wehave in our bosoms, we have great need to keep our hearts with alldiligence. Those cannot walk aright, who walk carelessly. Moses chargesparticularly to take heed of the sin of idolatry. He shows how weak thetemptation would be to those who thought aright; for these pretendedgods, the sun, moon, and stars, were only blessings which the Lordtheir God had imparted to all nations. It is absurd to worship them;shall we serve those that were made to serve us? Take heed lest yeforget the covenant of the Lord your God. We must take heed lest at anytime we forget our religion. Care, caution, and watchfulness, are helpsagainst a bad memory.
Deu 4:24-40	<br>Moses urged the greatness, glory, and goodness of God. Did we considerwhat a God he is with whom we have to do, we should surely makeconscience of our duty to him, and not dare to sin against him. Shallwe forsake a merciful God, who will never forsake us, if we arefaithful unto him? Whither can we go? Let us be held to our duty by thebonds of love, and prevailed with by the mercies of God to cleave tohim. Moses urged God's authority over them, and their obligations tohim. In keeping God's commandments they would act wisely forthemselves. The fear of the Lord, that is wisdom. Those who enjoy thebenefit of Divine light and laws, ought to support their character forwisdom and honour, that God may be glorified thereby. Those who callupon God, shall certainly find him within call, ready to give an answerof peace to every prayer of faith. All these statutes and judgments ofthe Divine law are just and righteous, above the statutes and judgmentsof any of the nations. What they saw at mount Sinai, gave an earnest ofthe day of judgment, in which the Lord Jesus shall be revealed inflaming fire. They must also remember what they heard at mount Sinai.God manifests himself in the works of the creation, without speech orlanguage, yet their voice is heard, Ps 19:1,3; but to Israel he madehimself known by speech and language, condescending to their weakness.The rise of this nation was quite different from the origin of allother nations. See the reasons of free grace; we are not beloved forour own sakes, but for Christ's sake. Moses urged the certain benefitand advantage of obedience. This argument he had begun with, 
Deu 4:1),That ye may live, and go in and possess the land; and this he concludeswith, 	
Deu 4:40), That it may go well with thee, and with thy childrenafter thee. He reminds them that their prosperity would depend upontheir piety. Apostacy from God would undoubtedly be the ruin of theirnation. He foresees their revolt from God to idols. Those, and thoseonly, shall find God to their comfort, who seek him with all theirheart. Afflictions engage and quicken us to seek God; and, by the graceof God working with them, many are thus brought back to their rightmind. When these things are come upon thee, turn to the Lord thy God,for thou seest what comes of turning from him. Let all the arguments belaid together, and then say, if religion has not reason on its side.None cast off the government of their God, but those who first abandonthe understanding of a man.	
Deu 4:41-49	<br>Here is the introduction to another discourse, or sermon, Mosespreached to Israel, which we have in the following chapters. He setsthe law before them, as the rule they were to work by, the way theywere to walk in. He sets it before them, as the glass in which theywere to see their natural face, that, looking into this perfect law ofliberty, they might continue therein. These are the laws, given whenIsrael was newly come out of Egypt; and they were now repeated. Mosesgave these laws in charge, while they encamped over against Beth-peor,an idol place of the Moabites. Their present triumphs were a powerfulargument for obedience. And we should understand our own situation assinners, and the nature of that gracious covenant to which we areinvited. Therein greater things are shown to us than ever Israel sawfrom mount Sinai; greater mercies are given to us than they experiencedin the wilderness, or in Canaan. One speaks to us, who is of infinitelygreater dignity than Moses; who bare our sins upon the cross; andpleads with us by His dying love.
Deu 5:1-5	<br>Moses demands attention. When we hear the word of God we must learn it;and what we have learned we must put in practice, for that is the endof hearing and learning; not to fill our heads with notions, or ourmouths with talk, but to direct our affections and conduct.
Deu 5:6-22	<br>There is some variation here from Ex 20 as between the Lord's prayer inMt 6 and Lu 11. It is more necessary that we tie ourselves to thethings, than to the words unalterably. The original reason forhallowing the sabbath, taken from God's resting from the work ofcreation on the seventh day, is not here mentioned. Though this everremains in force, it is not the only reason. Here it is taken fromIsrael's deliverance out of Egypt; for that was typical of ourredemption by Jesus Christ, in remembrance of which the Christiansabbath was to be observed. In the resurrection of Christ we werebrought into the glorious liberty of the children of God, with a mightyhand, and an outstretched arm. How sweet is it to a soul trulydistressed under the terrors of a broken law, to hear the mild andsoul-reviving language of the gospel!
Deu 5:23-33	<br>Moses refers to the consternation caused by the terror with which thelaw was given. God's appearances have always been terrible to man, eversince the fall; but Christ, having taken away sin, invites us to comeboldly to the throne of grace. They were in a good mind, under thestrong convictions of the word they heard. Many have their consciencesstartled by the law who have them not purified; fair promises areextorted from them, but no good principles are fixed and rooted inthem. God commended what they said. He desires the welfare andsalvation of poor sinners. He has given abundant proof that he does so;he gives us time and space to repent. He has sent his Son to redeem us,promised his Spirit to those who pray for him, and has declared that hehas no pleasure in the ruin of sinners. It would be well with many, ifthere were always such a heart in them, as there seems to be sometimes;when they are under conviction of sin, or the rebukes of providence, orwhen they come to look death in the face. The only way to be happy, isto be holy. Say to the righteous, It shall be well with them. Letbelievers make it more and more their study and delight, to do as theLord God hath commanded.
Deu 6:1-3	<br>In this and the like passages, the "commandments" seem to denote themoral law, the "statues" the ceremonial law, and the "judgments" thelaw by which the judges decided. Moses taught the people all that, andthat only, which God commanded him to teach. Thus Christ's ministersare to teach his churches all he has commanded, neither more nor less,Mt 28:20. The fear of God in the heart will be the most powerfulprinciple of obedience. It is highly desirable that not we only, butour children, and our children's children, may fear the Lord. Religionand righteousness advance and secure the prosperity of any people.
Deu 6:4,5	<br>Here is a brief summary of religion, containing the first principles offaith and obedience. Jehovah our God is the only living and true God;he only is God, and he is but One God. Let us not desire to have anyother. The three-fold mention of the Divine names, and the pluralnumber of the word translated God, seem plainly to intimate a Trinityof persons, even in this express declaration of the unity of theGodhead. Happy those who have this one Lord for their God. It is betterto have one fountain than a thousand cisterns; one all-sufficient Godthan a thousand insufficient friends. This is the first and greatcommandment of God's law, that we love him; and that we do all parts ofour duty to him from a principle of love; My son, give me thine heart.We are to love God with all our heart, and soul, and might. That is, 1.With a sincere love; not in word and tongue only, but inwardly intruth. 2. With a strong love. He that is our All, must have our all,and none but he. 3. With a superlative love; we must love God above anycreature whatever, and love nothing but what we love for him. 4. Withan intelligent love. To love him with all the heart, and with all theunderstanding, we must see good cause to love him. 5. With an entirelove; he is ONE, our hearts must be united in his love. Oh that thislove of God may be shed abroad in our hearts!
Deu 6:6-16	<br>Here are means for maintaining and keeping up religion in our heartsand houses. 1. Meditation. God's words must be laid up in our hearts,that our thoughts may be daily employed about them. 2. The religiouseducation of children. Often repeat these things to them. Be carefuland exact in teaching thy children. Teach these truths to all who areany way under thy care. 3. Pious discourse. Thou shalt talk of thesethings with due reverence and seriousness, for the benefit not only ofthy children, but of thy servants, thy friends and companions. Take alloccasions to discourse with those about thee, not of matters ofdoubtful disputation, but of the plain truths and laws of God, and thethings that belong to our peace. 4. Frequent reading of the word. Godappointed them to write sentences of the law upon their walls, and inscrolls of parchment to be worn about their wrists. This seems to havebeen binding in the letter of it to the Jews, as it is to us in theintent of it; which is, that we should by all means make the word ofGod familiar to us; that we may have it ready to use upon alloccasions, to restrain us from sin, and direct us in duty. We mustnever be ashamed to own our religion, nor to own ourselves under itscheck and government. Here is a caution not to forget God in a day ofprosperity and plenty. When they came easily by the gift, they would beapt to grow secure, and unmindful of the Giver. Therefore be careful,when thou liest safe and soft, lest thou forget the Lord. When theworld smiles, we are apt to make court to it, and expect our happinessin it, and so we forget Him who is our only portion and rest. There isneed of great care and caution at such a time. Then beware; beingwarned of your danger, stand upon your guard. Thou shalt not tempt theLord thy God; neither by despairing of his power and goodness, while wekeep in the way of our duty; nor by presuming upon it, when we turnaside out of that way.
Deu 6:17-25	<br>Moses gives charge to keep God's commandments. Negligence will ruin us;but we cannot be saved without diligence. It is our interest, as wellas our duty, to be religious. It will be our life. Godliness has thepromise of the continuance and comfort of the life that now is, as faras it is for God's glory. It will be our righteousness. It is onlythrough the Mediator we can be righteous before God. The knowledge ofthe spirituality and excellency of the holy law of God, is suited toshow sinful man his need of a Saviour, and to prepare his heart towelcome a free salvation. The gospel honours the law, not only in theperfect obedience of the Son of God, the Lord Jesus Christ; but in thatit is a plan for bringing back apostate rebels and enemies, byrepentance, faith, forgiveness, and renewing grace, to love God aboveall things, even in this world; and in the world above, to love himperfectly, even as angels love him.
Deu 7:1-11	<br>Here is a strict caution against all friendship and fellowship withidols and idolaters. Those who are in communion with God, must have nocommunication with the unfruitful works of darkness. Limiting theorders to destroy, to the nations here mentioned, plainly shows thatafter ages were not to draw this into a precedent. A properunderstanding of the evil of sin, and of the mystery of a crucifiedSaviour, will enable us to perceive the justice of God in all hispunishments, temporal and eternal. We must deal decidedly with ourlusts that war against our souls; let us not show them any mercy, butmortify, and crucify, and utterly destroy them. Thousands in the worldthat now is, have been undone by ungodly marriages; for there is morelikelihood that the good will be perverted, than that the bad will beconverted. Those who, in choosing yoke-fellows, keep not within thebounds of a profession of religion, cannot promise themselves helpsmeet for them.
Deu 7:12-26	<br>We are in danger of having fellowship with the works of darkness if wetake pleasure in fellowship with those who do such works. Whateverbrings us into a snare, brings us under a curse. Let us be constant toour duty, and we cannot question the constancy of God's mercy. Diseasesare God's servants; they go where he sends them, and do what he bidsthem. It is therefore good for the health of our bodies, thoroughly tomortify the sin of our souls; which is our rule of duty. Yet sin isnever totally destroyed in this world; and it actually prevails in usmuch more than it would do, if we were watchful and diligent. In allthis the Lord acts according to the counsel of his own will; but thatcounsel being hid from us, forms no excuse for our sloth andnegligence, of which it is in no degree the cause. We must not think,that because the deliverance of the church, and the destruction of theenemies of the soul, are not done immediately, therefore they willnever be done. God will do his own work in his own method and time; andwe may be sure that they are always the best. Thus corruption is drivenout of the hearts of believers by little and little. The work ofsanctification is carried on gradually; but at length there will be acomplete victory. Pride, security, and other sins that are commoneffects of prosperity, are enemies more dangerous than beasts of thefield, and more apt to increase upon us.
Deu 8:1-9	<br>Obedience must be, 1. Careful, observe to do; 2. Universal, to do allthe commandments; and 3. From a good principle, with a regard to God asthe Lord, and their God, and with a holy fear of him. To engage them tothis obedience. Moses directs them to look back. It is good to rememberall the ways, both of God's providence and grace, by which he has ledus through this wilderness, that we may cheerfully serve him and trustin him. They must remember the straits they were sometimes broughtinto, for mortifying their pride, and manifesting their perverseness;to prove them, that they and others might know all that was in theirheart, and that all might see that God chose them, not for any thing inthem which might recommend them to his favour. They must remember themiraculous supplies of food and raiment granted them. Let none of God'schildren distrust their Father, nor take any sinful course for thesupply of their necessities. Some way or other, God will provide forthem in the way of duty and honest diligence, and verily they shall befed. It may be applied spiritually; the word of God is the food of thesoul. Christ is the word of God; by him we live. They must alsoremember the rebukes they had been under, and not without need. Thisuse we should make of all our afflictions; by them let us be quickenedto our duty. Moses also directs them to look forward to Canaan. Lookwhich way we will, both to look back and to look forward, to Canaan.Look which way we will, both to look back and to look forward willfurnish us with arguments for obedience. Moses saw in that land a typeof the better country. The gospel church is the New Testament Canaan,watered with the Spirit in his gifts and graces, planted with trees ofrighteousness, bearing fruits of righteousness. Heaven is the goodland, in which nothing is wanting, and where is fulness of joy.
Deu 8:10-20	<br>Moses directs to the duty of a prosperous condition. Let them alwaysremember their Benefactor. In everything we must give thanks. Mosesarms them against the temptations of a prosperous condition. When menpossess large estates, or are engaged in profitable business, they findthe temptation to pride, forgetfulness of God, and carnal-mindedness,very strong; and they are anxious and troubled about many things. Inthis the believing poor have the advantage; they more easily perceivetheir supplies coming from the Lord in answer to the prayer of faith;and, strange as it may seem, they find less difficulty in simplytrusting him for daily bread. They taste a sweetness therein, which isgenerally unknown to the rich, while they are also freed from many oftheir temptations. Forget not God's former dealings with thee. Here isthe great secret of Divine Providence. Infinite wisdom and goodness arethe source of all the changes and trials believers experience. Israelhad many bitter trials, but it was "to do them good." Pride is naturalto the human heart. Would one suppose that such a people, after theirslavery at the brick-kilns, should need the thorns of the wilderness tohumble them? But such is man! And they were proved that they might behumbled. None of us live a single week without giving proofs of ourweakness, folly, and depravity. To broken-hearted souls alone theSaviour is precious indeed. Nothing can render the most suitableoutward and inward trials effectual, but the power of the Spirit ofGod. See here how God's giving and our getting are reconciled, andapply it to spiritual wealth. All God's gifts are in pursuance of hispromises. Moses repeats the warning he had often given of the fatalconsequences of forsaking God. Those who follow others in sin, willfollow them to destruction. If we do as sinners do, we must expect tofare as sinners fare.
Deu 9:1-6	<br>Moses represents the strength of the enemies they were now toencounter. This was to drive them to God, and engage their hope in him.He assures them of victory, by the presence of God with them. Hecautions them not to have the least thought of their own righteousness,as if that procured this favour at God's hand. In Christ we have bothrighteousness and strength; in Him we must glory, not in ourselves, norin any sufficiency of our own. It is for the wickedness of thesenations that God drives them out. All whom God rejects, are rejectedfor their own wickedness; but none whom he accepts are accepted fortheir own righteousness. Thus boasting is for ever done away: see Eph2:9,11, 12.
Deu 9:7-29	<br>That the Israelites might have no pretence to think that God broughtthem to Canaan for their righteousness, Moses shows what a miracle ofmercy it was, that they had not been destroyed in the wilderness. It isgood for us often to remember against ourselves, with sorrow and shame,our former sins; that we may see how much we are indebted to freegrace, and may humbly own that we never merited any thing but wrath andthe curse at God's hand. For so strong is our propensity to pride, thatit will creep in under one pretence or another. We are ready to fancythat our righteousness has got for us the special favour of the Lord,though in reality our wickedness is more plain than our weakness. Butwhen the secret history of every man's life shall be brought forth atthe day of judgment, all the world will be proved guilty before God. Atpresent, One pleads for us before the mercy-seat, who not only fasted,but died upon the cross for our sins; through whom we may approach,though self-condemned sinners, and beseech for undeserved mercy and foreternal life, as the gift of God in Him. Let us refer all the victory,all the glory, and all the praise, to Him who alone bringeth salvation.
Deu 10:1-11	<br>Moses reminded the Israelites of God's great mercy to them,notwithstanding their provocations. There were four things in and bywhich the Lord showed himself reconciled to Israel. God gave them hislaw. Thus God has intrusted us with Bibles, sabbaths, and sacraments,as tokens of his presence and favour. God led them forward towardCanaan. He appointed a standing ministry among them for holy things.And now, under the gospel, when the pouring forth of the Spirit is moreplentiful and powerful, the succession is kept up by the Spirit's workon men's hearts, qualifying and making some willing for that work inevery age. God accepted Moses as an advocate or intercessor for them,and therefore appointed him to be their prince and leader. Moses was atype of Christ, who ever lives, pleading for us, and has all power inheaven and in earth.
Deu 10:12-22	<br>We are here taught our duty to God in our principles and our practices.We must fear the Lord our God. We must love him, and delight incommunion with him. We must walk in the ways in which he has appointedus to walk. We must serve him with all our heart and soul. What we doin his service we must do cheerfully, and with good will. We must keephis commandments. There is true honour and pleasure in obedience. Wemust give honour to God; and to him we must cleave, as one we love anddelight in, trust in, and from whom we have great expectations. We arehere taught our duty to our neighbour. God's common gifts to mankindoblige us to honour all men. And those who have themselves been indistress, and have found mercy with God, should be ready to showkindness to those who are in the like distress. We are here taught ourduty to ourselves. Circumcise your hearts. Cast away all corruptaffections and inclinations, which hinder you from fearing and lovingGod. By nature we do not love God. This is original sin, the sourcewhence our wickedness proceeds; and the carnal mind is enmity againstGod, for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be; sothen they that are in the flesh cannot please God, Ro 8:5-9. Let us,without delay or reserve, come and cleave to our reconciled God inJesus Christ, that we may love, serve, and obey him acceptably, and bedaily changed into his image, from glory to glory, by the Spirit of theLord. Consider the greatness and glory of God; and his goodness andgrace; these persuade us to our duty. Blessed Spirit! Oh for thypurifying, persevering, and renewing influences, that being called outof the state of strangers, such as our fathers were, we may be foundamong the number of the children of God, and that our lot may be amongthe saints.
Deu 11:1-7	<br>Observe the connexion of these two; Thou shalt love the Lord, and keephis charge. Love will work in obedience, and that only is acceptableobedience which flows from a principle of love, 1Jo 5:3. Moses recountssome of the great and terrible works of God which their eyes had seen.What our eyes have seen, especially in our early days, should affectus, and make us better long afterwards.
Deu 11:8-17	<br>Moses sets before them, for the future, life and death, the blessingand the curse, according as they did or did not keep God's commandment.Sin tends to shorten the days of all men, and to shorten the days of apeople's prosperity. God will bless them with an abundance of all goodthings, if they would love him and serve him. Godliness has the promiseof the life that now is; but the favour of God shall put gladness intothe heart, more than the increase of corn, and wine, and oil. Revoltfrom God to idols would certainly be their ruin. Take heed that yourhearts be not deceived. All who forsake God to set their affection uponany creature, will find themselves wretchedly deceived, to their owndestruction; and this will make it worse, that it was for want oftaking heed.
Deu 11:18-25	<br>Let all be directed by the three rules here given. 1. Let our hearts befilled with the word of God. There will not be good practices in thelife, unless there be good thoughts, good affections, and goodprinciples in the heart. 2. Let our eyes be fixed upon the word of God,having constant regard to it as the guide of our way, as the rule ofour work, Ps 119:30. 3. Let our tongues be employed about the word ofGod. Nor will any thing do more to cause prosperity, and keeping upreligion in a nation, than the good education of children.
Deu 11:26-32	<br>Moses sums up all the arguments for obedience in two words, theblessing and the curse. He charged the people to choose which theywould have. Moses then appointed a public and solemn proclamation ofthe blessing and curse, to be made upon the two mountains of Gerizimand Ebal. We have broken the law, and are under its curse, withoutremedy from ourselves. In mercy, the gospel again sets before us ablessing and a curse. A blessing, if we obey the call to repentance, tofaith in Christ, and newness of heart and life through him; an awfulcurse, if we neglect so great salvation. Let us thankfully welcomethese glad tidings of great joy; and let us not harden our hearts, buthear this voice of God while it is called to-day, and while he invitesus to come to him upon a mercy-seat. Let us be diligent to make ourcalling and election sure.
Deu 12:1-4	<br>Moses comes to the statutes he had to give in charge to Israel; andbegins with such as relate to the worship of God. The Israelites arecharged not to bring the rites and usages of idolaters into the worshipof God; not under colour of making it better. We cannot serve God andmammon; nor worship the true God and idols; nor depend upon ChristJesus and upon superstitious or self-righteous confidences.
Deu 12:5-32	<br>The command to bring ALL the sacrifices to the door of the tabernacle,was now explained with reference to the promised land. As to moralservice, then, as now, men might pray and worship every where, as theydid in their synagogues. The place which God would choose, is said tobe the place where he would put his name. It was to be his habitation,where, as King of Israel, he would be found by all who reverentlysought him. Now, under the gospel, we have no temple or altar thatsanctifies the gift but Christ only: and as to the places of worship,the prophets foretold that in every place the spiritual incense shouldbe offered, Mal 1:11. Our Saviour declared, that those are accepted astrue worshippers, who worship God in sincerity and truth, withoutregard either to this mountain or Jerusalem, Joh 4:21. And a devoutIsraelite might honour God, keep up communion with him, and obtainmercy from him, though he had no opportunity of bringing a sacrifice tohis altar. Work for God should be done with holy joy and cheerfulness.Even children and servants must rejoice before God; the services ofreligion are to be a pleasure, and not a task or drudgery. It is theduty of people to be kind to their ministers, who teach them well, andset them good examples. As long as we live, we need their assistance,till we come to that world where ordinances will not be needed. Whetherwe eat or drink, or whatever we do, we are commanded to do all to theglory of God. And we must do all in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ,giving thanks to the Father through him. They must not even inquireinto the modes and forms of idolatrous worship. What good would it dothem to know those depths of Satan? And our inward satisfaction will bemore and more, as we abound in love and good works, which spring fromfaith and the in-dwelling Spirit of Christ.
Deu 13:1-5	<br>Moses had cautioned against the peril that might arise from theCanaanites. Here he cautions against the rise of idolatry amongthemselves. It is needful for us to be well acquainted with the truthsand precepts of the Bible; for we may expect to be proved bytemptations of evil under the appearance of good, of error in the guiseof truth; nor can any thing rightly oppose such temptations, but theplain, express testimony of God's word to the contrary. And it would bea proof of sincere affection for God, that, notwithstanding speciouspretences, they should not be wrought upon the forsake God, and followother gods to serve them.
Deu 13:6-11	<br>It is the policy of Satan to try to lead us to evil by those whom welove, whom we least suspect of any ill design, and whom we are desirousto please, and apt to conform to. The enticement here is supposed tocome from a brother or child, who are near by nature; from a wife orfriend, who are near by choice, and are to us as our souls. But it isour duty to prefer God and religion, before the nearest and dearestfriends we have in the world. We must not, to please our friends, breakGod's law. Thou shalt not consent to him, nor go with him, not forcompany, or curiosity, not to gain his affections. It is a generalrule, If sinners entice thee, consent thou not, Pr 1:10. And we mustnot hinder the course of God's justice.
Deu 13:12-18	<br>Here is the case of a city revolting from the God of Israel, andserving other gods. The crime is supposed to be committed by one of thecities of Israel. Even when they were ordered to preserve theirreligion by force, yet they were not allowed to bring others to it byfire and sword. Spiritual judgments under the Christian dispensationare more terrible than the execution of criminals; we have not lesscause than the Israelites had, to fear the Divine wrath. Let us thenfear the spiritual idolatry of covetousness, and the love of worldlypleasure; and be careful not to countenance them in our families, byour example or by the education of our children. May the Lord write hislaw and truth in our hearts, there set up his throne, and shed abroadhis love!
Deu 14:1-21	<br>Moses tells the people of Israel how God had given them threedistinguishing privileges, which were their honour, and figures ofthose spiritual blessings in heavenly things, with which God has inChrist blessed us. Here is election; "The Lord hath chosen thee." Hedid not choose them because they were by their own acts a peculiarpeople to him above other nations, but he chose them that they might beso by his grace; and thus were believers chosen, Eph 1:4. Here isadoption; "Ye are the children of the Lord your God;" not because Godneeded children, but because they were orphans, and needed a father.Every spiritual Israelite is indeed a child of God, a partaker of hisnature and favour. Here is sanctification; "Thou art a holy people."God's people are required to be holy, and if they are holy, they areindebted to the grace God which makes them so. Those whom God choosesto be his children, he will form to be a holy people, and zealous ofgood works. They must be careful to avoid every thing which mightdisgrace their profession, in the sight of those who watch for theirhalting. Our heavenly Father forbids nothing but for our welfare. Dothyself no harm; do not ruin thy health, thy reputation, thy domesticcomforts, thy peace of mind. Especially do not murder thy soul. Do notbe the vile slave of thy appetites and passions. Do not render allaround thee miserable, and thyself wretched; but aim at that which ismost excellent and useful. The laws which regarded many sorts of fleshas unclean, were to keep them from mingling with their idolatrousneighbours. It is plain in the gospel, that these laws are now doneaway. But let us ask our own hearts, Are we of the children of the Lordour God? Are we separate from the ungodly world, in being set apart toGod's glory, the purchase of Christ's blood? Are we subjects of thework of the Holy Ghost? Lord, teach us from these precepts how pure andholy all thy people ought to live!
Deu 14:22-29	<br>A second portion from the produce of their land was required. The wholeappointment evidently was against the covetousness, distrust, andselfishness of the human heart. It promoted friendliness, liberality,and cheerfulness, and raised a fund for the relief of the poor. Theywere taught that their worldly portion was most comfortably enjoyed,when shared with their brethren who were in want. If we thus serve God,and do good with what we have, it is promised that the Lord our Godwill bless us in all the works of our land. The blessing of God is allto our outward prosperity; and without that blessing, the work of ourhands will bring nothing to pass. The blessing descends upon theworking hand. Expect not that God should bless thee in thy idleness andlove of ease. And it descends upon the giving hand. He who thusscatters, certainly increases; and to be free and generous in thesupport of religion, and any good work, is the surest and safest way ofthriving.
Deu 15:1-11	<br>This year of release typified the grace of the gospel, in which isproclaimed the acceptable year of the Lord; and by which we obtain therelease of our debts, that is, the pardon of our sins. The law isspiritual, and lays restraints upon the thoughts of the heart. Wemistake, if we think thoughts are free from God's knowledge and check.That is a wicked heart indeed, which raises evil thoughts from the goodlaw of God, as theirs did, who, because God had obliged them to thecharity of forgiving, denied the charity of giving. Those who wouldkeep from the act of sin, must keep out of their minds the very thoughtof sin. It is a dreadful thing to have the cry of the poor justlyagainst us. Grudge not a kindness to thy brother; distrust not theprovidence of God. What thou doest, do freely, for God loves a cheerfulgiver, 2Co 9:7.
Deu 15:12-18	<br>Here the law concerning Hebrew servants is repeated. There is anaddition, requiring the masters to put some small stock into theirservants' hands to set up with for themselves, when sent out of theirservitude, wherein they had received no wages. We may expect familyblessings, the springs of family prosperity, when we make conscience ofour duty to our family relations. We are to remember that we aredebtors to Divine justice, and have nothing to pay with. That we areslaves, poor, and perishing. But the Lord Jesus Christ, by becomingpoor, and by shedding his blood, has made a full and free provision forthe payment of our debts, the ransom of our souls, and the supply ofall our wants. When the gospel is clearly preached, the acceptable yearof the Lord is proclaimed; the year of release of our debts, of thedeliverance of our souls, and of obtaining rest in him. And as faith inChrist and love to him prevail, they will triumph over the selfishnessof the heart, and over the unkindness of the world, doing away theexcuses that rise from unbelief, distrust, and covetousness.
Deu 15:19-23	<br>Here is a direction what to do with the firstlings. We are not nowlimited as the Israelites were; we make no difference between a firstcalf, or lamb, and the rest. Let us then look to the gospel meaning ofthis law, devoting ourselves and the first of our time and strength toGod; and using all our comforts and enjoyments to his praise, and underthe direction of his law, as we have them all by his gift.
Deu 16:1-17	<br>The laws for the three yearly feasts are here repeated; that of thePassover, that of the Pentecost, that of Tabernacles; and the generallaw concerning the people's attendance. Never should a believer forgethis low estate of guilt and misery, his deliverance, and the price itcost the Redeemer; that gratitude and joy in the Lord may be mingledwith sorrow for sin, and patience under the tribulations in his way tothe kingdom of heaven. They must rejoice in their receivings from God,and in their returns of service and sacrifice to him; our duty must beour delight, as well as our enjoyment. If those who were under the lawmust rejoice before God, much more we that are under the grace of thegospel; which makes it our duty to rejoice evermore, to rejoice in theLord always. When we rejoice in God ourselves, we should do what we canto assist others also to rejoice in him, by comforting the mourners,and supplying those who are in want. All who make God their joy, mayrejoice in hope, for He is faithful that has promised.
Deu 16:18-22	<br>Care is taken for the due administration of justice. All personalregards must be laid aside, so that right is done to all, and wrong tonone. Care is taken to prevent following the idolatrous customs of theheathen. Nothing belies God more, or tends more to corrupt the minds ofmen, than representing and worshipping, by an image, that God, who isan almighty and eternal Spirit, present every where. Alas! even ingospel days, and under a better dispensation, established upon betterpromises, there is a tendency to set up idols, under one form oranother, in the human heart.
Deu 17:1-7	<br>No creature which had any blemish was to be offered in sacrifice toGod. We are thus called to remember the perfect, pure, and spotlesssacrifice of Christ, and reminded to serve God with the best of ourabilities, time, and possession, or our pretended obedience will behateful to him. So great a punishment as death, so remarkable a deathas stoning, must be inflicted on the Jewish idolater. Let all who inour day set up idols in their hearts, remember how God punished thiscrime in Israel.
Deu 17:8-13	<br>Courts of judgment were to be set up in every city. Though theirjudgment had not the Divine authority of an oracle, it was the judgmentof wise, prudent, experienced men, and had the advantage of a Divinepromise.
Deu 17:14-20	<br>God himself was in a particular manner Israel's King; and if they setanother over them, it was necessary that he should choose the person.Accordingly, when the people desired a king, they applied to Samuel, aprophet of the Lord. In all cases, God's choice, if we can but know it,should direct, determine, and overrule ours. Laws are given for theprince that should be elected. He must carefully avoid every thing thatwould turn him from God and religion. Riches, honours, and pleasures,are three great hinderances of godliness, (the lusts of the flesh, thelusts of the eye, and the pride of life,) especially to those in highstations; against these the king is here warned. The king mustcarefully study the law of God, and make that his rule; and having acopy of the Scriptures of his own writing, must read therein all thedays of his life. It is not enough to have Bibles, but we must usethem, use them daily, as long as we live. Christ's scholars never learnabove their Bibles, but will have constant occasion for them, till theycome to that world where knowledge and love will be made perfect. Theking's writing and reading were as nothing, if he did not practise whathe wrote and read. And those who fear God and keep his commandments,will fare the better for it even in this world.
Deu 18:1-8	<br>Care is taken that the priests entangle not themselves with the affairsof this life, nor enrich themselves with the wealth of this world; theyhave better things to mind. Care is likewise taken that they want notthe comforts and conveniences of this life. The people must provide forthem. He that has the benefit of solemn religious assemblies, ought togive help for the comfortable support of those that minister in suchassemblies.
Deu 18:9-14	<br>Was it possible that a people so blessed with Divine institutions,should ever be in any danger of making those their teachers whom Godhad made their captives? They were in danger; therefore, after manylike cautions, they are charged not to do after the abominations of thenations of Canaan. All reckoning of lucky or unlucky days, all charmsfor diseases, all amulets or spells to prevent evil, fortune-telling,&c. are here forbidden. These are so wicked as to be a chief cause ofthe rooting out of the Canaanites. It is amazing to think that thereshould be any pretenders of this kind in such a land, and day of light,as we live in. They are mere impostors who blind and cheat theirfollowers.
Deu 18:15-22	<br>It is here promised concerning Christ, that there should come aProphet, great above all the prophets; by whom God would make knownhimself and his will to the children of men, more fully and clearlythan he had ever done before. He is the Light of the world, Joh 8:12.He is the World by whom God speaks to us, Joh 1:1; Heb 1:2. In hisbirth he should be one of their nation. In his resurrection he shouldbe raised up at Jerusalem, and from thence his doctrine should go forthto all the world. Thus God, having raised up his Son Christ Jesus, senthim to bless us. He should be like unto Moses, only above him. Thisprophet is come, even JESUS; and is "He that should come," and we areto look for no other. The view of God which he gives, will not terrifyor overwhelm, but encourages us. He speaks with fatherly affection andDivine authority united. Whoever refuses to listen to Jesus Christ,shall find it is at his peril; the same that is the Prophet is to behis Judge, Joh 12:48. Woe then to those who refuse to hearken to Hisvoice, to accept His salvation, or yield obedience to His sway! Buthappy they who trust in Him, and obey Him. He will lead them in thepaths of safety and peace, until He brings them to the land of perfectlight, purity, and happiness. Here is a caution against false prophets.It highly concerns us to have a right touchstone wherewith to try theword we hear, that we may know what that word is which the Lord has notspoken. Whatever is against the plain sense of the written word, orwhich gives countenance or encouragement to sin, we may be sure is notthat which the Lord has spoken.
Deu 19:1-13	<br>Here is the law settled between the blood of the murdered, and theblood of the murderer; provision is made, that the cities of refugeshould be a protection, so that a man should not die for that as acrime, which was not his willing act. In Christ, the Lord ourRighteousness, refuge is provided for those who by faith flee unto him.But there is no refuge in Jesus Christ for presumptuous sinners, who goon still in their trespasses. Those who flee to Christ from their sins,shall be safe in him, but not those who expect to be sheltered by himin their sins.<br>Verse 14<br>Direction is given to fix landmarks in Canaan. It is the will of Godthat every one should know his own; and that means should be used tohinder the doing and suffering of wrong. This, without doubt, is amoral precept, and still binding. Let every man be content with his ownlot, and be just to his neighbours in all things.
Deu 19:15-21	<br>Sentence should never be passed upon the testimony of one witnessalone. A false witness should suffer the same punishment which hesought to have inflicted upon the person he accused. Nor could any lawbe more just. Let all Christians not only be cautious in bearingwitness in public, but be careful not to join in private slanders; andlet all whose consciences accuse them of crime, without delay flee forrefuge to the hope set before them in Jesus Christ.
Deu 20:1-9	<br>In the wars wherein Israel engaged according to the will of God, theymight expect the Divine assistance. The Lord was to be their onlyconfidence. In these respects they were types of the Christian'swarfare. Those unwilling to fight, must be sent away. The unwillingnessmight arise from a man's outward condition. God would not be served bymen forced against their will. Thy people shall be willing, Ps 110:3.In running the Christian race, and fighting the good fight of faith, wemust lay aside all that would make us unwilling. If a man'sunwillingness rose from weakness and fear, he had leave to return fromthe war. The reason here given is, lest his brethren's heart fail aswell as his heart. We must take heed that we fear not with the fear ofthem that are afraid, Isa 8:12.
Deu 20:10-12	<br>The Israelites are here directed about the nations on whom they madewar. Let this show God's grace in dealing with sinners. He proclaimspeace, and beseeches them to be reconciled. Let it also show us ourduty in dealing with our brethren. Whoever are for war, we must be forpeace. Of the cities given to Israel, none of their inhabitants must beleft. Since it could not be expected that they should be cured of theiridolatry, they would hurt Israel. These regulations are not the rulesof our conduct, but Christ's law of love. The horrors of war must fillthe feeling heart with anguish upon every recollection; and are proofsof the wickedness of man, the power of Satan, and the just vengeance ofGod, who thus scourges a guilty world. But how dreadful their case whoare engaged in unequal conflict with their Maker, who will not submitto render him the easy tribute of worship and praise! Certain ruinawaits them. Let neither the number nor the power of the enemies of oursouls dismay us; nor let even our own weakness cause us to tremble orto faint. The Lord will save us; but in this war let none engage whosehearts are fond of the world, or afraid of the cross and the conflict.Care is here taken that in besieging cities the fruit-trees should notbe destroyed. God is a better friend to man than he is to himself; andGod's law consults our interests and comforts; while our own appetitesand passions, which we indulge, are enemies to our welfare. Many of theDivine precepts restrain us from destroying that which is for our lifeand food. The Jews understand this as forbidding all wilful waste uponany account whatsoever. Every creature of God is good; as nothing is tobe refused, so nothing is to be abused. We may live to want what wecarelessly waste.
Deu 21:1-9	<br>If a murderer could not be found out, great solemnity is provided forputting away the guilt from the land, as an expression of dread anddetesting of that sin. The providence of God has often wonderfullybrought to light these hidden works of darkness, and the sin of theguilty has often strangely found them out. The dread of murder shouldbe deeply impressed upon every heart, and all should join in detectingand punishing those who are guilty. The elders were to profess thatthey had not been any way aiding or abetting the sin. The priests wereto pray to God for the country and nation, that God would be merciful.We must empty that measure by our prayers, which others are filling bytheir sins. All would be taught by this solemnity, to use the utmostcare and diligence to prevent, discover, and punish murder. We may alllearn from hence to take heed of partaking in other men's sins. And wehave fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, if we do notreprove them.
Deu 21:10-14	<br>By this law a soldier was allowed to marry his captive, if he pleased.This might take place upon some occasions; but the law does not showany approval of it. It also intimates how binding the laws of justiceand honour are in marriage; which is a sacred engagement.
Deu 21:15-17	<br>This law restrains men from disinheriting their eldest sons withoutjust cause. The principle in this case as to children, is still bindingto parents; they must give children their right without partiality.
Deu 21:18-21	<br>Observe how the criminal is here described. He is a stubborn andrebellious son. No child was to fare the worse for weakness ofcapacity, slowness, or dulness, but for wilfulness and obstinacy.Nothing draws men into all manner of wickedness, and hardens them in itmore certainly and fatally, than drunkenness. When men take todrinking, they forget the law of honouring parents. His own father andmother must complain of him to the elders of the city. Children whoforget their duty, must thank themselves, and not blame their parents,if they are regarded with less and less affection. He must be publiclystoned to death by the men of his city. Disobedience to a parent'sauthority must be very evil, when such a punishment was ordered; nor isit less provoking to God now, though it escapes punishment in thisworld. But when young people early become slaves to sensual appetites,the heart soon grows hard, and the conscience callous; and we canexpect nothing but rebellion and destruction.
Deu 21:22,23	<br>By the law of Moses, the touch of a dead body was defiling, thereforedead bodies must not be left hanging, as that would defile the land.There is one reason here which has reference to Christ; "He that ishanged is accursed of God;" that is, it is the highest degree ofdisgrace and reproach. Those who see a man thus hanging between heavenand earth, will conclude him abandoned of both, and unworthy of either.Moses, by the Spirit, uses this phrase of being accursed of God, whenhe means no more than being treated most disgracefully, that it mightafterward be applied to the death of Christ, and might show that in ithe underwent the curse of the law for us; which proves his love, andencourages to faith in him.
Deu 22:1-4	<br>If we duly regard the golden rule of "doing to others as we would theyshould do unto us," many particular precepts might be omitted. We canhave no property in any thing that we find. Religion teaches us to beneighbourly, and to be ready to do all good offices to all men. We knownot how soon we may have occasion for help.
Deu 22:5-12	<br>God's providence extends itself to the smallest affairs, and hisprecepts do so, that even in them we may be in the fear of the Lord, aswe are under his eye and care. Yet the tendency of these laws, whichseem little, is such, that being found among the things of God's law,they are to be accounted great things. If we would prove ourselves tobe God's people, we must have respect to his will and to his glory, andnot to the vain fashions of the world. Even in putting on our garments,as in eating or in drinking, all must be done with a serious regard topreserve our own and others' purity in heart and actions. Our eyeshould be single, our heart simple, and our behaviour all of a piece.
Deu 22:13-30	<br>These and the like regulations might be needful then, and yet it is notnecessary that we should curiously examine respecting them. The lawsrelate to the seventh commandment, laying a restraint upon fleshlylusts which war against the soul.
Deu 23:1-8	<br>We ought to value the privileges of God's people, both for ourselvesand for our children, above all other advantages. No personalblemishes, no crimes of our forefathers, no difference of nation, shutsus out under the Christian dispensation. But an unsound heart willdeprive us of blessings; and a bad example, or an unsuitable marriage,may shut our children from them.
Deu 23:9-14	<br>The camp of the Lord must have nothing offensive in it. If there mustbe this care taken to preserve the body clean, much more should we becareful to keep the mind pure.
Deu 23:15-25	<br>It is honourable to shelter and protect the weak, provided they are notwicked. Proselytes and converts to the truth, should be treated withparticular tenderness, that they may have no temptation to return tothe world. We cannot honour God with our substance, unless it behonestly and honourably come by. It must not only be considered what wegive, but how we got it. Where the borrower gets, or hopes to get, itis just that the lender should share the gain; but to him that borrowsfor necessary food, pity must be showed. That which is gone out of thylips, as a solemn and deliberate vow, must not be recalled, but thoushalt keep and perform it punctually and fully. They were allowed topluck and eat of the corn or grapes that grew by the road side; onlythey must not carry any away. This law intimated what great plenty ofcorn and wine they should have in Canaan. It provided for the supportof poor travellers, and teaches us to be kind to such, teaches us to beready to distribute, and not to think every thing lost that is givenaway. Yet it forbids us to abuse the kindness of friends, or to takeadvantage of what is allowed. Faithfulness to their engagements shouldmark the people of God; and they should never encroach upon others.
Deu 24:1-4	<br>Where the providence of God, or his own wrong choice in marriage, hasallotted to a Christian a trial instead of a help meet; he will fromhis heart prefer bearing the cross, to such relief as tends to sin,confusion, and misery. Divine grace will sanctify this cross, supportunder it, and teach so to behave, as will gradually render it moretolerable.
Deu 24:5-13	<br>It is of great consequence that love be kept up between husband andwife; that they carefully avoid every thing which might make themstrange one to another. Man-stealing was a capital crime, which couldnot be settled, as other thefts, by restitution. The laws concerningleprosy must be carefully observed. Thus all who feel their consciencesunder guilt and wrath, must not cover it, or endeavour to shake offtheir convictions; but by repentance, and prayer, and humbleconfession, take the way to peace and pardon. Some orders are givenabout pledges for money lent. This teaches us to consult the comfortand subsistence of others, as much as our own advantage. Let the poordebtor sleep in his own raiment, and praise God for thy kindness tohim. Poor debtors ought to feel more than commonly they do, thegoodness of creditors who do not take all the advantage of the lawagainst them, nor should this ever be looked upon as weakness.
Deu 24:14-22	<br>It is not hard to prove that purity, piety, justice, mercy, fairconduct, kindness to the poor and destitute, consideration for them,and generosity of spirit, are pleasing to God, and becoming in hisredeemed people. The difficulty is to attend to them in our daily walkand conversation.
Deu 25:1-3	<br>Every punishment should be with solemnity, that those who see it may befilled with dread, and be warned not to offend in like manner. Andthough the criminals must be shamed as well as put to pain, for theirwarning and disgrace, yet care should be taken that they do not appeartotally vile. Happy those who are chastened of the Lord to humble them,that they should not be condemned with the world to destruction.<br>Verse 4<br>This is a charge to husbandmen. It teaches us to make much of theanimals that serve us. But we must learn, not only to be just, but kindto all who are employed for the good of our better part, our souls, 1Co9:9.
Deu 25:5-12	<br>The custom here regulated seems to have been in the Jewish law in orderto keep inheritances distinct; now it is unlawful.
Deu 25:13-16	<br>Dishonest gain always brings a curse on men's property, families, andsouls. Happy those who judge themselves, repent of and forsake theirsins, and put away evil things, that they may not be condemned of theLord.
Deu 25:17-19	<br>Let every persecutor and injurer of God's people take warning from thecase of the Amalekites. The longer it is before judgement comes, themore dreadful will it be at last. Amalek may remind us of the foes ofour souls. May we be enabled to slay all our lusts, all the corruptionsboth within and without, all the powers of darkness and of the world,which oppose our way to the blessed Saviour.
Deu 26:1-11	<br>When God has made good his promises to us, he expects we should own itto the honour of his faithfulness. And our creature comforts are doublysweet, when we see them flowing from the fountain of the promise. Theperson who offered his first-fruits, must remember and own the meanorigin of that nation, of which he was a member. A Syrian ready toperish was my father. Jacob is here called a Syrian. Their nation inits infancy sojourned in Egypt as strangers, they served there asslaves. They were a poor, despised, oppressed people in Egypt; andthough become rich and great, had no reason to be proud, secure, orforgetful of God. He must thankfully acknowledge God's great goodnessto Israel. The comfort we have in our own enjoyments, should lead us tobe thankful for our share in public peace and plenty; and with presentmercies we should bless the Lord for the former mercies we remember,and the further mercies we expect and hope for. He must offer hisbasket of first-fruits. Whatever good thing God gives us, it is hiswill that we make the most comfortable use we can of it, tracing thestreams to the Fountain of all consolation.
Deu 26:12-15	<br>How should the earth yield its increase, or, if it does, what comfortcan we take in it, unless therewith our God gives us his blessing? Allthis represented the covenant relation between a reconciled God andevery true believer, and the privileges and duties belonging to it. Wemust be watchful, and show that according to the covenant of grace inChrist Jesus, the Lord is our God, and we are his people, waiting inhis appointed way for the performance of his gracious promises.
Deu 26:16-19	<br>Moses here enforces the precepts. They are God's laws, therefore thoushalt do them, to that end were they given thee; do them, and disputethem not; do them, and draw not back; do them, not carelessly andhypocritically, but with thy heart and soul, thy whole heart and thywhole soul. We forswear ourselves, and break the most sacredengagement, if, when we have taken the Lord to be our God, we do notmake conscience of obeying his commands. We are elected to obedience,1Pe 1:2; chosen that we should be holy, Eph 1:4; purified a peculiarpeople, that we might not only do good works, but be zealous in them,Tit 2:14. Holiness is true honour, and the only way to everlastinghonour.
Deu 27:1-10	<br>As soon as they were come into Canaan, they must set up a monument, onwhich they must write the words of this law. They must set up an altar.The word and prayer must go together. Though they might not, of theirown heads, set up any altar besides that at the tabernacle; yet, by theappointment of God, they might, upon special occasion. This altar mustbe made of unhewn stones, such as they found upon the field. Christ,our Altar, is a stone cut out of the mountain without hands, refused bythe builders, as having no form or comeliness, but accepted of God theFather, and made the Head of the corner. In the Old Testament the wordsof the law are written, with the curse annexed; which would overcome uswith horror, if we had not, in the New Testament, an altar erectedclose by, which gives consolation. Blessed be God, the printed copiesof the Scriptures among us, do away the necessity of such methods aswere presented to Israel. The end of the gospel ministry is, and theend of preachers ought to be, to make the word of God as plain aspossible. Yet, unless the Spirit of God prosper such labours withDivine power, we shall not, even by these means, be made wise untosalvation: for this blessing we should therefore daily and earnestlypray.
Deu 27:11-26	<br>The six tribes appointed for blessing, were all children of the freewomen, for to such the promise belongs, Ga 4:31. Levi is here among therest. Ministers should apply to themselves the blessing and curse theypreach to others, and by faith set their own Amen to it. And they mustnot only allure people to their duty with the promises of a blessing,but awe them with the threatenings of a curse, by declaring that acurse would be upon those who do such things. To each of the curses thepeople were to say, Amen. It professed their faith, that these, and thelike curses, were real declarations of the wrath of God against theungodliness and unrighteousness of men, not one jot of which shall fallto the ground. It was acknowledging the equity of these curses. Thosewho do such things deserve to fall, and lie under the curse. Lest thosewho were guilty of other sins, not here mentioned, should thinkthemselves safe from the curse, the last reaches all. Not only thosewho do the evil which the law forbids, but those also who omit the goodwhich the law requires. Without the atoning blood of Christ, sinnerscan neither have communion with a holy God, nor do any thing acceptableto him; his righteous law condemns every one who, at any time, or inany thing, transgresses it. Under its awful curse we remain astransgressors, until the redemption of Christ is applied to our hearts.Wherever the grace of God brings salvation, it teaches the believer todeny ungodliness and wordly lusts, to live soberly, righteously, andgodly in this present world, consenting to, and delighting in the wordsof God's law, after the inward man. In this holy walk, true peace andsolid joy are to be found.
Deu 28:1-14	<br>This chapter is a very large exposition of two words, the blessing andthe curse. They are real things and have real effects. The blessingsare here put before the curses. God is slow to anger, but swift to showmercy. It is his delight to bless. It is better that we should be drawnto what is good by a child-like hope of God's favour, than that we befrightened to it by a slavish fear of his wrath. The blessing ispromised, upon condition that they diligently hearken to the voice ofGod. Let them keep up religion, the form and power of it, in theirfamilies and nation, then the providence of God would prosper all theiroutward concerns.
Deu 28:15-44	<br>If we do not keep God's commandments, we not only come short of theblessing promised, but we lay ourselves under the curse, which includesall misery, as the blessing all happiness. Observe the justice of thiscurse. It is not a curse causeless, or for some light cause. The extentand power of this curse. Wherever the sinner goes, the curse of Godfollows; wherever he is, it rests upon him. Whatever he has is under acurse. All his enjoyments are made bitter; he cannot take any truecomfort in them, for the wrath of God mixes itself with them. Manyjudgments are here stated, which would be the fruits of the curse, andwith which God would punish the people of the Jews, for their apostacyand disobedience. We may observe the fulfilling of these threateningsin their present state. To complete their misery, it is threatened thatby these troubles they should be bereaved of all comfort and hope, andleft to utter despair. Those who walk by sight, and not by faith, arein danger of losing reason itself, when every thing about them looksfrightful.
Deu 28:45-68	<br>If God inflicts vengeance, what miseries his curse can bring uponmankind, even in this present world! Yet these are but the beginning ofsorrows to those under the curse of God. What then will be the miseryof that world where their worm dieth not, and their fire is notquenched! Observe what is here said of the wrath of God, which shouldcome and remain upon the Israelites for their sins. It is amazing tothink that a people so long the favourites of Heaven, should be so castoff; and yet that a people so scattered in all nations should be keptdistinct, and not mixed with others. If they would not serve God withcheerfulness, they should be compelled to serve their enemies. We mayjustly expect from God, that if we do not fear his fearful name, weshall feel his fearful plagues; for one way or other God will befeared. The destruction threatened is described. They have, indeed,been plucked from off the land, 
Deu 28:63	<br>Not only by the Babylonishcaptivity, and when Jerusalem was destroyed by the Romans; butafterwards, when they were forbidden to set foot in Jerusalem. Theyshould have no rest; no rest of body, ver. 65, but be continually onthe remove, either in hope of gain, or fear of persecution. No rest ofthe mind, which is much worse. They have been banished from city tocity, from country to country; recalled, and banished again. Theseevents, compared with the favour shown to Israel in ancient times, andwith the prophecies about them, should not only excite astonishment,but turn unto us for a testimony, assuring us of the truth ofScripture. And when the other prophecies of their conversion to Christshall come to pass, the whole will be a sign and a wonder to all thenations of the earth, and the forerunner of a general spread of truechristianity. The fulfilling of these prophecies upon the Jewishnation, delivered more than three thousand years ago, shows that Mosesspake by the Spirit of God; who not only foresees the ruin of sinners,but warns of it, that they may prevent it by a true and timelyrepentance, or else be left without excuse. And let us be thankful thatChrist hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, by being made acurse for us, and bearing in his own person all that punishment whichour sins merit, and which we must otherwise have endured for ever. Tothis Refuge and salvation let sinners flee; therein let believersrejoice, and serve their reconciled God with gladness of heart, for theabundance of his spiritual blessings.
Deu 29:1-9	<br>Both former mercies, and fresh mercies, should be thought on by us asmotives to obedience. The hearing ear, and seeing eye, and theunderstanding heart, are the gift of God. All that have them, have themfrom him. God gives not only food and raiment, but wealth and largepossessions, to many to whom he does not give grace. Many enjoy thegifts, who have not hearts to perceive the Giver, nor the true designand use of the gifts. We are bound, in gratitude and interest, as wellas in duty and faithfulness, to keep the words of the covenant.
Deu 29:10-21	<br>The national covenant made with Israel, not only typified the covenantof grace made with true believers, but also represented the outwarddispensation of the gospel. Those who have been enabled to consent tothe Lord's new covenant of mercy and grace in Jesus Christ, and to giveup themselves to be his people, should embrace every opportunity ofrenewing their open profession of relation to him, and their obligationto him, as the God of salvation, walking according thereto. The sinneris described as one whose heart turns away from his God; there themischief begins, in the evil heart of unbelief, which inclines men todepart from the living God to dead idols. Even to this sin men are nowtempted, when drawn aside by their own lusts and fancies. Such men areroots that bear gall and wormwood. They are weeds which, if let alone,overspread the whole field. Satan may for a time disguise this bittermorsel, so that thou shalt not have the natural taste of it, but at thelast day, if not before, the true taste shall be discerned. Notice thesinner's security in sin. Though he hears the words of the curse, yeteven then he thinks himself safe from the wrath of God. There isscarcely a threatening in all the book of God more dreadful than this.Oh that presumptuous sinners would read it, and tremble! for it is areal declaration of the wrath of God, against ungodliness andunrighteousness of man.
Deu 29:22-28	<br>Idolatry would be the ruin of their nation. It is no new thing for Godto bring desolating judgments on a people near to him in profession. Henever does this without good reason. It concerns us to seek for thereason, that we may give glory to God, and take warning to ourselves.Thus the law of Moses leaves sinners under the curse, and rooted out ofthe Lord's land; but the grace of Christ toward penitent, believingsinners, plants them again in their land; and they shall no more bepulled up, being kept by the power of God.<br>Verse 29<br>Moses ends his prophecy of the Jews' rejection, just as St. Paul endshis discourse on the same subject, when it began to be fulfilled, Ro11:33. We are forbidden curiously to inquire into the secret counselsof God, and to determine concerning them. But we are directed andencouraged, diligently to seek into that which God has made known. Hehas kept back nothing that is profitable for us, but only that of whichit is good for us to be ignorant. The end of all Divine revelation is,not to furnish curious subjects of speculation and discourse, but thatwe may do all the words of this law, and be blessed in our deed. This,the Bible plainly reveals; further than this, man cannot profitably go.By this light he may live and die comfortably, and be happy for ever.
Deu 30:1-10	<br>In this chapter is a plain intimation of the mercy God has in store forIsrael in the latter days. This passage refers to the propheticwarnings of the last two chapters, which have been mainly fulfilled inthe destruction of Jerusalem by the Romans, and in their dispersion tothe present day; and there can be no doubt that the prophetic promisecontained in these verses yet remain to come to pass. The Jewish nationshall in some future period, perhaps not very distant, be converted tothe faith of Christ; and, many think, again settled in the land ofCanaan. The language here used is in a great measure absolute promises;not merely a conditional engagement, but declaring an event assuredlyto take place. For the Lord himself here engages to "circumcise theirhearts;" and when regenerating grace has removed corrupt nature, andDivine love has supplanted the love of sin, they certainly willreflect, repent, return to God, and obey him; and he will rejoice indoing them good. The change that will be wrought upon them will not beonly outward, or consisting in mere opinions; it will reach to theirsouls. It will produce in them an utter hatred of all sin, and afervent love to God, as their reconciled God in Christ Jesus; they willlove him with all their hearts, and with all their soul. They are veryfar from this state of mind at present, but so were the murderers ofthe Lord Jesus, on the day of Pentecost; who yet in one hour wereconverted unto God. So shall it be in the day of God's power; a nationshall be born in a day; the Lord will hasten it in his time. As aconditional promise this passage belongs to all persons and all people,not to Israel only; it assures us that the greatest sinners, if theyrepent and are converted, shall have their sins pardoned, and berestored to God's favour.
Deu 30:11-14	<br>The law is not too high for thee. It is not only known afar off; it isnot confined to men of learning. It is written in thy books, madeplain, so that he who runs may read it. It is in thy mouth, in thetongue commonly used by thee, in which thou mayest hear it read, andtalk of it among thy children. It is delivered so that it is level tothe understanding of the meanest. This is especially true of the gospelof Christ, to which the apostle applies it. But the word is nigh us,and Christ in that word; so that if we believe with the heart, that thepromises of the Messiah are fulfilled in our Lord Jesus, and confessthem with our mouth, we then have Christ with us.
Deu 30:15-20	<br>What could be said more moving, and more likely to make deep andlasting impressions? Every man wishes to obtain life and good, and toescape death and evil; he desires happiness, and dreads misery. Sogreat is the compassion of the Lord, that he has favoured men, by hisword, with such a knowledge of good and evil as will make them for everhappy, if it be not their own fault. Let us hear the sum of the wholematter. If they and theirs would love God, and serve him, they shouldlive and be happy. If they or theirs should turn from God, desert hisservice, and worship other gods, that would certainly be their ruin.There never was, since the fall of man, more than one way to heaven;which is marked out in both Testaments, though not with equalclearness. Moses meant that same way of acceptance, which Paul moreplainly described; and Paul's words mean the same obedience, on whichMoses more fully treated. In both Testaments the good and right way isbrought near, and plainly revealed to us.
Deu 31:1-8	<br>Moses assures Israel of the constant presence of God with them. This isapplied by the apostle to all God's spiritual Israel, to encouragetheir faith and hope; unto us is this gospel preached, as well as untothem; he will never fail thee, nor forsake thee, Heb 13:5. Mosescommends Joshua to them for a leader; one whose wisdom, and courage,and affection they had long known; one whom God had appointed to betheir leader; and therefore would own and bless. Joshua is well pleasedto be admonished by Moses to be strong and of good courage. Those shallspeed well, who have God with them; therefore they ought to be of goodcourage. Through God let us do valiantly, for through him we shall dovictoriously; if we resist the devil, he will flee from us.
Deu 31:9-13	<br>Though we read the word in private, we must not think it needless tohear it read in public. This solemn reading of the law must be done inthe year of release. The year of release was typical of gospel grace,which is called the acceptable year of the Lord; for our pardon andliberty by Christ, engage us to keep his commandments. It must be readto all Israel, men, women, children, and to the strangers. It is thewill of God that all people should acquaint themselves with his word.It is a rule to all, therefore should be read to all. Whoever has readof the pains taken by many persons to get scraps of the Scriptures,when a whole copy could not be obtained, or safely possessed, will seehow thankful we should be for the thousands of copies amongst us. Theywill also understand the very different situation in which theIsraelites were placed for many ages. But the heart of man is socareless, that all will be found too little, to keep up a knowledge ofthe truths, precepts, and worship of God.
Deu 31:14-22	<br>Moses and Joshua attended the Divine Majesty at the door of thetabernacle. Moses is told again that he must shortly die; even thosewho are most ready and willing to die, need to be often reminded of itscoming. The Lord tells Moses, that, after his death, the covenant hehad taken so much pains to make between Israel and their God, wouldcertainly be broken. Israel would forsake Him; then God would forsakeIsrael. Justly does he cast those off who so unjustly cast him off.Moses is directed to deliver them a song, which should remain astanding testimony for God, as faithful to them in giving them warning,and against them, as persons false to themselves in not taking thewarning. The word of God is a discerner of the thoughts and intents ofmen's hearts, and meets them by reproofs and correction. Ministers whopreach the word, know not the imaginations of men; but God, whose wordit is, knows perfectly.
Deu 31:23-30	<br>The solemn delivery of the book of the law to the Levites, to bedeposited in, or rather by the side, of the ark, is again related. Thesong which follows in the next chapter is delivered to Moses, and byhim to the people. He wrote it first, as the Holy Spirit taught him;and then spake it in the hearing of all the people. Moses tells themplainly, I know that after my death ye will utterly corrupt yourselves.Many a sad thought, no doubt, it occasioned to this good man; but hiscomfort was, that he had done his duty, and that God would be glorifiedin their dispersion, if not in their settlement, for the foundation ofGod stands sure.
Deu 32:1,2	<br>Moses begins with a solemn appeal to heaven and earth, concerning thetruth and importance of what he was about to say. His doctrine is thegospel, the speech of God, the doctrine of Christ; the doctrine ofgrace and mercy through him, and of life and salvation by him.
Deu 32:3-6	<br>"He is a Rock." This is the first time God is called so in Scripture.The expression denotes that the Divine power, faithfulness, and love,as revealed in Christ and the gospel, form a foundation which cannot bechanged or moved, on which we may build our hopes of happiness. Andunder his protection we may find refuge from all our enemies, and inall our troubles; as the rocks in those countries sheltered from theburning rays of the sun, and from tempests, or were fortresses from theenemy. "His work is perfect:" that of redemption and salvation, inwhich there is a display of all the Divine perfection, complete in allits parts. All God's dealings with his creatures are regulated bywisdom which cannot err, and perfect justice. He is indeed just andright; he takes care that none shall lose by him. A high charge isexhibited against Israel. Even God's children have their spots, whilein this imperfect state; for if we say we have no sin, no spot, wedeceive ourselves. But the sin of Israel was not habitual, notorious,unrepented sin; which is a certain mark of the children of Satan. Theywere fools to forsake their mercies for lying vanities. All wilfulsinners, especially sinners in Israel, are unwise and ungrateful.
Deu 32:7-14	<br>Moses gives particular instances of God's kindness and concern forthem. The eagle's care for her young is a beautiful emblem of Christ'slove, who came between Divine justice and our guilty souls, and bareour sins in his own body on the tree. And by the preached gospel, andthe influences of the Holy Spirit, He stirs up and prevails uponsinners to leave Satan's bondage. In 
Deu 32:13,14), are emblems of theconquest believers have over their spiritual enemies, sin, Satan, andthe world, in and through Christ. Also of their safety and triumph inhim; of their happy frames of soul, when they are above the world, andthe things of it. This will be the blessed case of spiritual Israel inevery sense in the latter day.	
Deu 32:15-18	<br>Here are two instances of the wickedness of Israel, each was apostacyfrom God. These people were called Jeshurun, "an upright people," sosome; "a seeing people," so others: but they soon lost the reputationboth of their knowledge and of their righteousness. They indulged theirappetites, as if they had nothing to do but to make provision for theflesh to fulfil the lusts of it. Those who make a god of themselves,and a god of their bellies, in pride and wantonness, and cannot bear tobe told of it, thereby forsake God, and show they esteem him lightly.There is but one way of a sinner's acceptance and sanctification,however different modes of irreligion, or false religion, may show thatfavourable regard for other ways, which is often miscalled candid. Howmad are idolaters, who forsake the Rock of salvation, to run themselvesupon the rock of perdition!
Deu 32:19-25	<br>The revolt of Israel was described in the foregoing verses, and herefollow the resolves of Divine justice as to them. We deceive ourselves,if we think that God will be mocked by a faithless people. Sin makes ushateful in the sight of the holy God. See what mischief sin does, andreckon those to be fools that mock at it.
Deu 32:26-38	<br>The idolatry and rebellions of Israel deserved, and the justice of Godseemed to demand, that they should be rooted out. But He spared Israel,and continues them still to be living witnesses of the truth of theBible, and to silence unbelievers. They are preserved for wise and holypurposes and the prophecies give us some idea what those purposes are.The Lord will never disgrace the throne of his glory. It is greatwisdom, and will help much to the return of sinners to God, seriouslyto consider their latter end, or the future state. It is here meantparticularly of what God foretold by Moses, about this people in thelatter days; but it may be applied generally. Oh that men wouldconsider the happiness they will lose, and the misery they willcertainly plunge into, if they go on in their trespasses! What will bein the end thereof? Jer 5:31. For the Lord will in due time bring downthe enemies of the church, in displeasure against their wickedness.When sinners deem themselves most secure, they suddenly fall intodestruction. And God's time to appear for the deliverance of hispeople, is when things are at the worst with them. But those who trustto any rock but God, will find it fail them when they most need it. Therejection of the Messiah by the Jewish nation, is the continuance oftheir ancient idolatry, apostacy, and rebellion. They shall be broughtto humble themselves before the Lord, to repent of their sins, and totrust in their long-rejected Mediator for salvation. Then he willdeliver them, and make their prosperity great.
Deu 32:39-43	<br>This conclusion of the song speaks, 1. Glory to God. No escape can bemade from his power. 2. It speaks terror to his enemies. Terror indeedto those who hate him. The wrath of God is here revealed from heavenagainst them. 3. It speaks comfort to his own people. The songconcludes with words of joy. Whatever judgments are brought uponsinners, it shall go well with the people of God.
Deu 32:44-47	<br>Here is the solemn delivery of this song to Israel, with a charge tomind all the good words Moses had said unto them. It is not a trifle,but a matter of life and death: mind it, and you are made for ever;neglect it, and you are for ever undone. Oh that men were fullypersuaded that religion is their life, even the life of their souls!
Deu 32:48-52	<br>Now Moses had done his work, why should he desire to live a day longer?God reminds him of the sin of which he had been guilty, for which hewas kept from entering Canaan. It is good for the best of men to dierepenting the infirmities of which they are conscious. But those maydie with comfort and ease, whenever God calls for them, notwithstandingthe sins they remember against themselves, who have a believingprospect, and a well-grounded hope of eternal life beyond death.
Deu 33:1-5	<br>To all his precepts, warnings, and prophecies, Moses added a solemnblessing. He begins with a description of the glorious appearances ofGod, in giving the law. His law works like fire. If received, it ismelting, warming, purifying, and burns up the dross of corruption; ifrejected, it hardens, sears, pains, and destroys. The Holy Spirit camedown in cloven tongues, as of fire; for the gospel also is a fiery law.The law of God written in the heart, is a certain proof of the love ofGod shed abroad there: we must reckon His law one of the gifts of hisgrace.
Deu 33:6-23	<br>The order in which the tribes are here blessed, is not the same as isobserved elsewhere. The blessing of Judah may refer to the whole tribein general, or to David as a type of Christ. Moses largely blesses thetribe of Levi. Acceptance with God is what we should all aim at, anddesire, in all our devotions, whether men accept us or not, 2Co 5:9.This prayer is a prophecy, that God will keep up a ministry in hischurch to the end of time. The tribe of Benjamin had their inheritanceclose to mount Zion. To be situated near the ordinances, is a preciousgift from the Lord, a privilege not to be exchanged for any worldlyadvantage, or indulgence. We should thankfully receive the earthlyblessings sent to us, through the successive seasons. But those goodgifts which come down from the Father of lights, through the rising ofthe Sun of righteousness, and the pouring out of his Spirit like therain which makes fruitful, are infinitely more precious, as the tokensof his special love. The precious things here prayed for, are figuresof spiritual blessing in heavenly things by Christ, the gifts, graces,and comforts of the Spirit. When Moses prays for the good will of Himthat dwelt in the bush, he refers to the covenant, on which all ourhopes of God's favour must be founded. The providence of God appointsmen's habitations, and wisely disposes men to different employments forthe public good. Whatever our place and business are, it is our wisdomand duty to apply thereto; and it is happiness to be well pleasedtherewith. We should not only invite others to the service of God, butabound in it. The blessing of Naphtali. The favour of God is the onlyfavour satisfying to the soul. Those are happy indeed, who have thefavour of God; and those shall have it, who reckon that in having itthey have enough, and desire no more.
Deu 33:24,25	<br>All shall be sanctified to true believers; if their way be rough, theirfeet shall be shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace. As thydays, so shall thy strength be. The "day" is often in Scripture put forthe events of the day; it is a promise that God would graciously andconstantly support under trials and troubles, whatever they were. It isa promise sure to all the spiritual seed of Abraham. Have they workallotted? They shall have strength to do it. Have they burdensappointed? They shall have strength, and never be tempted above whatthey are able to bear.
Deu 33:26-29	<br>None had such a God as Israel. There is no people like the Israel ofGod. What is here said of the church of Israel is to be applied to thespiritual church. Never were people so well seated and sheltered. Thosewho make God their habitation, shall have all the comforts and benefitsof a habitation in him, Ps 91:1. Never were people so well supportedand borne up. How low soever the people of God are at any time brought,everlasting arms are underneath them, to keep the spirit from sinking,from fainting, and their faith from failing. Divine grace is sufficientfor them, 2Co 12:9. Never were people so well commanded. Thus believersare more than conquerors over their spiritual enemies, through Christthat loved them. Never were people so well secured and protected.Israel shall dwell in safety alone. All who keep close to God, shall bekept safe by him. Never were people so well provided for. Every trueIsraelite looks with faith to the better country, the heavenly Canaan,which is filled with better things than corn and wine. Never werepeople so well helped. If in danger of any harm, or in want of anygood, they had an eternal God to go to. Nothing could hurt those whomGod helped, nor was it possible the people should perish who were savedby the Lord. Never were people so well armed. Those in whose hearts isthe excellency of holiness, are defended by the whole armour of God,Eph 6. Never were people so well assured of victory over their enemies.Thus shall the God of peace tread Satan under the feet of allbelievers, and shall do it shortly, Ro 16:20. May God help us to seekand to set our affections on the things above; and to turn our soulsfrom earthly perishing objects; that we may not have our lot withIsrael's foes in the regions of darkness and despair, but with theIsrael of God, in the realms of love and eternal happiness.
Deu 34:1-4	<br>Moses seemed unwilling to leave his work; but that being finished, hemanifested no unwillingness to die. God had declared that he should notenter Canaan. But the Lord also promised that Moses should have a viewof it, and showed him all that good land. Such a sight believers nowhave, through grace, of the bliss and glory of their future state.Sometimes God reserves the brightest discoveries of his grace to hispeople to support their dying moments. Those may leave this world withcheerfulness, who die in the faith of Christ, and in the hope ofheaven.
Deu 34:5-8	<br>Moses obeyed this command of God as willingly as any other, though itseemed harder. In this he resembled our Lord Jesus Christ. But he diedin honour, in peace, and in the most easy manner; the Saviour died uponthe disgraceful and torturing cross. Moses died very easily; he died"at the mouth of the Lord," according to the will of God. The servantsof the Lord, when they have done all their other work, must die atlast, and be willing to go home, whenever their Master sends for them,Ac 21:13. The place of his burial was not known. If the soul be at restwith God, it is of little consequence where the body rests. There wasno decay in the strength of his body, nor in the vigour and activity ofhis mind; his understanding was as clear, and his memory as strong asever. This was the reward of his services, the effect of hisextraordinary meekness. There was solemn mourning for him. Yet howgreat soever our losses have been, we must not give ourselves up tosorrow. If we hope to go to heaven rejoicing, why should we go to thegrave mourning?
Deu 34:9-12	<br>Moses brought Israel to the borders of Canaan, and then died and leftthem. This signifies that the law made nothing perfect, Heb 7:19 Itbrings men into a wilderness of conviction, but not into the Canaan ofrest and settled peace. That honour was reserved for Joshua, our LordJesus, of whom Joshua was a type, (and the name is the same,) to dothat for us which the law could not do, Ro 8:3. Through him we enterinto the spiritual rest of conscience, and eternal rest in heaven.Moses was greater than any other prophet of the Old Testament. But ourLord Jesus went beyond him, far more than the other prophets came shortof him. And see a strong resemblance between the redeemer of thechildren of Israel and the Redeemer of mankind. Moses was sent by God,to deliver the Israelites form a cruel bondage; he led them out, andconquered their enemies. He became not only their deliverer, but theirlawgiver; not only their lawgiver, but their judge; and, finally, leadsthem to the border of the land of promise. Our blessed Saviour came torescue us out of the slavery of the devil, and to restore us to libertyand happiness. He came to confirm every moral precept of the firstlawgiver; and to write them, not on tables of stone, but on fleshlytables of the heart. He came to be our Judge also, inasmuch as he hathappointed a day when he will judge all the secrets of men, and rewardor punish accordingly. This greatness of Christ above Moses, is areason why Christians should be obedient and faithful to the holyreligion by which they profess to be Christ's followers. God, by hisgrace, make us all so!
Jos 1:1-4	<br>Joshua had attended upon Moses. He who was called to honour, had beenlong used to business. Our Lord Jesus took upon him the form of aservant. Joshua was trained up under command. Those are fittest torule, who have learned to obey. The removal of useful men shouldquicken survivors to be the more diligent in doing good. Arise, go overJordan. At this place and at this time the banks were overflowed.Joshua had no bridge or boats, and yet he must believe that God, havingordered the people over, would open a way.
Jos 1:5-9	<br>Joshua is to make the law of God his rule. He is charged to meditatetherein day and night, that he might understand it. Whatever affairs ofthis world we have to mind, we must not neglect the one thing needful.All his orders to the people, and his judgments, must be according tothe law of God. Joshua must himself be under command; no man's dignityor dominion sets him above the law of God. He is to encourage himselfwith the promise and presence of God. Let not the sense of thine owninfirmities dishearten thee; God is all-sufficient. I have commanded,called, and commissioned thee to do it, and will be sure to bear theeout in it. When we are in the way of duty, we have reason to be strongand very bold. Our Lord Jesus, as Joshua here, was borne up under hissufferings by a regard to the will of God, and the commandment from hisFather.
Jos 1:10-15	<br>Joshua says to the people, Ye shall pass over Jordan, and shall possessthe land; because God had said so to him. We honour the truth of God,when we stagger not at the promise of God. The two tribes and a halfwere to go over Jordan with their brethren. When God, by hisprovidence, has given us rest, we ought to consider what service we maydo to our brethren.
Jos 1:16-18	<br>The people of Israel engage to obey Joshua; All that thou commandest usto do we will readily do, without murmuring or disputing, andwhithersoever thou sendest us we will go. The best we can ask of Godfor our magistrates, is, that they may have the presence of God; thatwill make them blessings to us, so that in seeking this for them, weconsult our own interest. May we be enabled to enlist under the bannerof the Captain of our salvation, to be obedient to his commands, and tofight the good fight of faith, with all that trust in and love hisname, against all who oppose his authority; for whoever refuses to obeyhim must be destroyed.
Jos 2:1-7	<br>Faith in God's promises ought not to do away, but to encourage ourdiligence in the use of proper means. The providence of God directedthe spies to the house of Rahab. God knew where there was one thatwould be true to them, though they did not. Rahab appears to have beenan innkeeper; and if she had formerly been one of bad life, which isdoubtful, she had left her evil courses. That which seems to us mostaccidental, is often overruled by the Divine providence to serve greatends. It was by faith that Rahab received those with peace, againstwhom her king and country had war. We are sure this was a good work; itis so spoken of by the apostle, Jas 2:25; and she did it by faith, sucha faith as set her above the fear of man. Those only are truebelievers, who find in their hearts to venture for God; they take hispeople for their people, and cast in their lot among them. The spieswere led by the special providence of God, and Rahab entertained themout of regard to Israel and Israel's God, and not for lucre or for anyevil purpose. Though excuses may be offered for the guilt of Rahab'sfalsehood, it seems best to admit nothing which tends to explain itaway. Her views of the Divine law must have been very dim: a falsehoodlike this, told by those who enjoy the light of revelation, whateverthe motive, would deserve heavy censure.
Jos 2:8-21	<br>Rahab had heard of the miracles the Lord wrought for Israel. Shebelieved that his promises would certainly be fulfilled, and histhreatenings take effect; and that there was no way of escape but bysubmitting to him, and joining with his people. The conduct of Rahabproved that she had the real principle of Divine faith. Observe thepromises the spies made to her. The goodness of God is often expressedby his kindness and truth, Ps 117:2; in both these we must be followersof him. Those who will be conscientious in keeping promises, arecautious in making them. The spies make needful conditions. The scarletcord, like the blood upon the doorpost at the passover, recalls toremembrance the sinner's security under the atoning blood of Christ;and that we are to flee thereto for refuge from the wrath of a justlyoffended God. The same cord Rahab used for the saving of theseIsraelites, was to be used for her own safety. What we serve and honourGod with, we may expect he will bless, and make useful to us.
Jos 2:22-24	<br>The report the spies brought was encouraging. All the people of thecountry faint because of Israel; they have neither wisdom to yield, norcourage to fight. Those terrors of conscience, and that sense of Divinewrath, which dismay the ungodly, but bring not to repentance, arefearful forebodings of approaching destruction. But grace yet aboundsto the chief of sinners. Let them, without delay, flee to Christ, andall shall be well.
Jos 3:1-6	<br>The Israelites came to Jordan in faith, having been told that theyshould pass it. In the way of duty, let us proceed as far as we can,and depend on the Lord. Joshua led them. Particular notice is taken ofhis early rising, as afterwards upon other occasions, which shows howlittle he sought his own ease. Those who would bring great things topass, must rise early. Love not sleep, lest thou come to poverty. Allin public stations should always attend to the duty of their place. Thepeople were to follow the ark. Thus must we walk after the rule of theword, and the direction of the Spirit, in everything; so shall peace beupon us as upon the Israel of God; but we must follow our ministersonly as they follow Christ. All their way through the wilderness was anuntrodden path, but most so this through Jordan. While we are here, wemust expect and prepare to pass ways that we have not passed before;but in the path of duty we may proceed with boldness and cheerfulness.Whether we are called to suffer poverty, pain, labour, persecution,reproach, or death, we are following the Author and Finisher of ourfaith; nor can we set our feet in any dangerous or difficult spot,through our whole journey, but faith will there see the prints of theRedeemer's feet, who trod that very path to glory above, and bids usfollow him, that where he is, we may be also. They were to sanctifythemselves. Would we experience the effects of God's love and power, wemust put away sin, and be careful not to grieve the Holy Spirit of God.
Jos 3:7-13	<br>The waters of Jordan shall be cut off. This must be done in such a wayas never was done, but in the dividing of the Red sea. That miracle ishere repeated; God has the same power to finish the salvation of hispeople, as to begin it; the WORD of the Lord was as truly with Joshuaas with Moses. God's appearances for his people ought to encouragefaith and hope. God's work is perfect, he will keep his people.Jordan's flood cannot keep out Israel, Canaan's force cannot turn themout again.
Jos 3:14-17	<br>Jordan overflowed all its banks. This magnified the power of God, andhis kindness to Israel. Although those who oppose the salvation ofGod's people have all advantages, yet God can and will conquer. Thispassage over Jordan, as an entrance to Canaan, after their long, wearywanderings in the wilderness, shadowed out the believer's passagethrough death to heaven, after he has finished his wanderings in thissinful world. Jesus, typified by the ark, hath gone before, and hecrossed the river when it most flooded the country around. Let ustreasure up experiences of His faithful and tender care, that they mayhelp our faith and hope in the last conflict.
Jos 4:1-9	<br>The works of the Lord are so worthy of rememberance, and the heart ofman is so prone to forget them, that various methods are needful torefresh our memories, for the glory of God, our advantage, and that ofour children. God gave orders for preparing this memorial.
Jos 4:10-19	<br>The priests with the ark did not stir till ordered to move. Let none beweary of waiting, while they have the tokens of God's presence withthem, even the ark of the covenant, though it be in the depths ofadversity. Notice is taken of the honour put upon Joshua. Those arefeared in the best manner, and to the best purpose, who make it appearthat God is with them, and that they set him before them.
Jos 4:20-24	<br>It is the duty of parents to tell their children betimes of the wordsand works of God, that they may be trained up in the way they shouldgo. In all the instruction parents give their children, they shouldteach them to fear God. Serious godliness is the best learning. Are wenot called, as much as the Israelites, to praise the loving-kindness ofour God? Shall we not raise a pillar to our God, who has brought usthrough dangers and distresses in so wonderful a way? For hitherto theLord hath helped us, as much as he did his saints of old. How great thestupidity and ingratitude of men, who perceive not His hand, and willnot acknowledge his goodness, in their frequent deliverances!
Jos 5:1-9	<br>How dreadful is their case, who see the wrath of God advancing towardsthem, without being able to turn it aside, or escape it! Such will bethe horrible situation of the wicked; nor can words express the anguishof their feelings, or the greatness of their terror. Oh that they wouldnow take warning, and before it be too late, flee for refuge to layhold upon that hope set before them in the gospel! God impressed thesefears on the Canaanites, and dispirited them. This gave a short rest tothe Israelites, and circumcision rolled away the reproach of Egypt.They were hereby owned to be the free-born children of God, having theseal of the covenant. When God glorifies himself in perfecting thesalvation of his people, he not only silences all enemies, but rollsback their reproaches upon themselves.
Jos 5:10-12	<br>A solemn passover was kept, at the time appointed by the law, in theplains of Jericho, in defiance of the Canaanites round about them. Itwas a performance of the promise, that when they went up to keep thefeasts, their land should be under the special protection of the Divineprovidence, Ex 34:24. Notice is taken of the ceasing of the manna assoon as they had eaten the old corn of the land. For as it came justwhen they needed, so it continued as long as they needed it. Thisteaches us not to expect supplies by miracles, when they may be had ina common way. The word and ordinances of God are spiritual manna, withwhich God nourishes his people in this wilderness. Though oftenforfeited, yet they are continued while we are here; but when we cometo the heavenly Canaan, this manna will cease, for we shall no longerneed it.
Jos 5:13-15	<br>We read not of any appearance of God's glory to Joshua till now. Thereappeared to him one as a man to be noticed. This Man was the Son ofGod, the eternal Word. Joshua gave him Divine honours: he receivedthem, which a created angel would not have done, and he is calledJehovah, chap. 6:2. To Abraham he appeared as a traveller; to Joshua asa man of war. Christ will be to his people what their faith needs.Christ had his sword drawn, which encouraged Joshua to carry on the warwith vigour. Christ's sword drawn in his hand, denotes how ready he isfor the defence and salvation of his people. His sword turns every way.Joshua will know whether he is a friend or a foe. The cause between theIsraelites and Canaanites, between Christ and Beelzebub, will not admitof any man's refusing to take one part or the other, as he may do inworldly contests. Joshua's inquiry shows an earnest desire to know thewill of Christ, and a cheerful readiness and resolution to do it. Alltrue Christians must fight under Christ's banner, and they will conquerby his presence and assistance.
Jos 6:1-5	<br>Jericho resolves Israel shall not be its master. It shut itself up,being strongly fortified both by art and nature. Thus were theyfoolish, and their hearts hardened to their destruction; the miserablecase of all that strengthen themselves against the Almighty. Godresolves Israel shall be its master, and that quickly. No warlikepreparations were to be made. By the uncommon method of besieging thecity, the Lord honoured the ark, as the symbol of his presence, andshowed that all the victories were from him. The faith and patience ofthe people were proved and increased.
Jos 6:6-16	<br>Wherever the ark went, the people attended it. God's ministers, by thetrumpet of the everlasting gospel, which proclaims liberty and victory,must encourage the followers of Christ in their spiritual warfare. Aspromised deliverances must be expected in God's way, so they must beexpected in his time. At last the people were to shout: they did so,and the walls fell. This was a shout of faith; they believed the wallsof Jericho would fall. It was a shout of prayer; they cry to Heaven forhelp, and help came.
Jos 6:17-27	<br>Jericho was to be a solemn and awful sacrifice to the justice of God,upon those who had filled up the measure of their sins. So He appoints,from whom, as creatures, they received their lives, and to whom, assinners, they had forfeited them. Rahab perished not with them thatbelieved not, Heb 11:31. All her kindred were saved with her; thusfaith in Christ brings salvation to the house, Ac 16:31. She, and theywith her, were plucked as brands from the burning. With Rahab, or withthe men of Jericho; our portion must be assigned, as we posses ordisregard the sign of salvation; even faith in Christ, which worketh bylove. Let us remember what depends upon our choice, and let us chooseaccordingly. God shows the weight of a Divine curse; where it reststhere is no getting from under it; for it brings ruin without remedy.
Jos 7:1-5	<br>Achan took some of the spoil of Jericho. The love of the world is thatroot of bitterness, which of all others is most hardly rooted up. Weshould take heed of sin ourselves, lest by it many be defiled ordisquieted, Heb 12:15; and take heed of having fellowship with sinners,lest we share their guilt. It concerns us to watch over one another toprevent sin, because others' sins may be to our damage. The easyconquest of Jericho excited contempt of the enemy, and a disposition toexpect the Lord to do all for them without their using proper means.Thus men abuse the doctrines of Divine grace, and the promises of God,into excuses for their own sloth and self-indulgence. We are to workout our own salvation, though it is God that works in us. It was a dearvictory to the Canaanites, whereby Israel was awakened and reformed,and reconciled to their God, and the people of Canaan hardened to theirown ruin.
Jos 7:6-9	<br>Joshua's concern for the honour of God, more than even for the fate ofIsrael, was the language of the Spirit of adoption. He pleaded withGod. He laments their defeat, as he feared it would reflect on God'swisdom and power, his goodness and faithfulness. We cannot at any timeurge a better plea than this, Lord, what wilt thou do for thy greatname? Let God be glorified in all, and then welcome his whole will.
Jos 7:10-15	<br>God awakens Joshua to inquiry, by telling him that when this accursedthing was put away, all would be well. Times of danger and troubleshould be times of reformation. We should look at home, into our ownhearts, into our own houses, and make diligent search to find out ifthere be not some accursed thing there, which God sees and abhors; somesecret lust, some unlawful gain, some undue withholding from God orfrom others. We cannot prosper, until the accursed thing be destroyedout of our hearts, and put out of our habitations and our families, andforsaken in our lives. When the sin of sinners finds them out, God isto be acknowledged. With a certain and unerring judgment, the righteousGod does and will distinguish between the innocent and the guilty; sothat though the righteous are of the same tribe, and family, andhousehold with the wicked, yet they never shall be treated as thewicked.
Jos 7:16-26	<br>See the folly of those that promise themselves secrecy in sin. Therighteous God has many ways of bringing to light the hidden works ofdarkness. See also, how much it is our concern, when God is contendingwith us, to find out the cause that troubles us. We must pray with holyJob, Lord, show me wherefore thou contendest with me. Achan's sin beganin the eye. He saw these fine things, as Eve saw the forbidden fruit.See what comes of suffering the heart to walk after the eyes, and whatneed we have to make this covenant with our eyes, that if they wanderthey shall be sure to weep for it. It proceeded out of the heart. Theythat would be kept from sinful actions, must mortify and check inthemselves sinful desires, particularly the desire of worldly wealth.Had Achan looked upon these things with an eye of faith, he would haveseen they were accursed things, and would have dreaded them; butlooking on them with an eye of sense only, he saw them as goodlythings, and coveted them. When he had committed the sin, he tried tohide it. As soon as he had got this plunder, it became his burden, andhe dared not to use his ill-gotten treasure. So differently do objectsof temptation appear at a distance, to what they do when they have beengotten. See the deceitfulness of sin; that which is pleasing in thecommission, is bitter in the reflection. See how they will be deceivedthat rob God. Sin is a very troublesome thing, not only to a sinnerhimself, but to all about him. The righteous God will certainlyrecompense tribulation to them that trouble his people. Achan perishednot alone in his sin. They lose their own, who grasp at more than theirown. His sons and daughters were put to death with him. It is probablethat they helped to hide the things; they must have known of them. Whatfatal consequences follow, even in this world, to the sinner himself,and to all belonging him! One sinner destroys much good. What, then,will be the wrath to come? Let us flee from it to Christ Jesus as thesinner's Friend. There are circumstances in the confession of Achan,marking the progress of sin, from its first entrance into the heart toits being done, which may serve as the history of almost every offenceagainst the law of God, and the sacrifice of Jesus Christ.
Jos 8:1,2	<br>When we have faithfully put away sin, that accursed thing whichseparates between us and God, then, and not till then, we may look tohear from God to our comfort; and God's directing us how to go on inour Christian work and warfare, is a good evidence of his beingreconciled to us. God encouraged Joshua to proceed. At Ai the spoil wasnot to be destroyed as at Jericho, therefore there was no danger of thepeople's committing such a trespass. Achan, who caught at forbiddenspoil, lost that, and life, and all; but the rest of the people, whokept themselves from the accursed thing, were quickly rewarded fortheir obedience. The way to have the comfort of what God allows us, is,to keep from what he forbids us. No man shall lose by self-denial.
Jos 8:3-22	<br>Observe Joshua's conduct and prudence. Those that would maintain theirspiritual conflicts must not love their ease. Probably he went into thevalley alone, to pray to God for a blessing, and he did not seek invain. He never drew back till the work was done. Those that havestretched out their hands against their spiritual enemies, must neverdraw them back.
Jos 8:23-29	<br>God, the righteous Judge, had sentenced the Canaanites for theirwickedness; the Israelites only executed his doom. None of theirconduct can be drawn into an example for others. Especial reason nodoubt there was for this severity to the king of Ai; it is likely hehad been notoriously wicked and vile, and a blasphemer of the God ofIsrael.
Jos 8:30-35	<br>As soon as Joshua got to the mountains Ebal and Gerizim, without delay,and without caring for the unsettled state of Israel, or their enemies,he confirmed the covenant of the Lord with his people, as appointed, De11; 27. We must not think to defer covenanting with God till we aresettled in the world; nor must any business put us from minding andpursuing the one thing needful. The way to prosper is to begin withGod, Mt 6:33. They built an altar, and offered sacrifice to God, intoken of their dedicating themselves to God, as living sacrifices tohis honour, in and by a Mediator. By Christ's sacrifice of himself forus, we have peace with God. It is a great mercy to any people to havethe law of God in writing, and it is fit that the written law should bein a known tongue, that it may be seen and read of all men.
Jos 9:1,2	<br>Hitherto the Canaanites had defended themselves, but here they consultto attack Israel. Their minds were blinded, and their hearts hardenedto their destruction. Though often at enmity with each other, yet theyunited against Israel. Oh that Israel would learn of Canaanites, tosacrifice private interests to the public welfare, and to lay aside allquarrels among themselves, that they may unite against the enemies ofGod's kingdom! (Jos 9:3-13)
Jos 9:3-13	<br>Other people heard these tidings, and were driven thereby to make warupon Israel; but the Gibeonites were led to make peace with them. Thusthe discovery of the glory and the grace of God in the gospel, is tosome a savour of life unto life, but to others a savour of death untodeath, 2Co 2:16. The same sun softens wax and hardens clay. Thefalsehood of the Gibeonites cannot be justified. We must not do evilthat good may themselves to the God of Israel, we have reason to thinkJoshua would have been directed by the oracle of God to spare theirlives. But when they had once said, "We are come from a far country,"they were led to say it made of skins, and their clothes: one liebrings on another, and that a third, and so on. The way of that sin isespecially down-hill. Yet their faith and prudence are to be commended.In submitting to Israel they submitted to the God of Israel, whichimplied forsaking their idolatries. And how can we do better than castourselves upon the mercy of a God of all goodness? The way to avoidjudgment is to meet it by repentance. Let us do like these Gibeonites,seek peace with God in the rags of abasement, and godly sorrow; so oursin shall not be our ruin. Let us be servants to Jesus, our blessedJoshua, and we shall live.
Jos 9:14-21	<br>The Israelites, having examined the provisions of the Gibeonites,hastily concluded that they confirmed their account. We make more hastethan good speed, when we stay not to take God with us, and do notconsult him by the word and prayer. The fraud was soon found out. Alying tongue is but for a moment. Had the oath been in itself unlawful,it would not have been binding; for no obligation can render it ourduty to commit a sin. But it was not unlawful to spare the Canaaniteswho submitted, and left idolatry, desiring only that their lives mightbe spared. A citizen of Zion swears to his own hurt, and changes not,Ps 15:4. Joshua and the princes, when they found that they had beendeceived, did not apply to Eleazar the high priest to be freed fromtheir engagement, much less did they pretend that no faith is to bekept with those to whom they had sworn. Let this convince us how weought to keep our promises, and make good our bargains; and whatconscience we ought to make of our words.
Jos 9:22-27	<br>The Gibeonites do not justify their lie, but plead that they did it tosave their lives. And the fear was not merely of the power of man; onemight flee from that to the Divine protection; but of the power of Godhimself, which they saw engaged against them. Joshua sentences them toperpetual bondage. They must be servants, but any work becomeshonourable, when it is done for the house of the Lord, and the officesthereof. Let us, in like manner, submit to our Lord Jesus, saying, Weare in thy hand, do unto us as seemeth good and right unto thee, onlysave our souls; and we shall not repent it. If He appoints us to bearhis cross, and serve him, that shall be neither shame nor grief to us,while the meanest office in God's service will entitle us to a dwellingin the house of the Lord all the days of our life. And in coming to theSaviour, we do not proceed upon a peradventure. We are invited to drawnigh, and are assured that him that cometh to Him, he will in nowisecast out. Even those things which sound harsh, and are humbling, andform sharp trials of our sincerity, will prove of real advantage.
Jos 10:1-6	<br>When sinners leave the service of Satan and the friendship of theworld, that they make peace with God and join Israel, they must notmarvel if the world hate them, if their former friends become foes. Bysuch methods Satan discourages many who are convinced of their danger,and almost persuaded to be Christians, but fear the cross. These thingsshould quicken us to apply to God for protection, help, anddeliverance.
Jos 10:7-14	<br>The meanest and most feeble, who have just begun to trust the Lord, areas much entitled to be protected as those who have long and faithfullybeen his servants. It is our duty to defend the afflicted, who, likethe Gibeonites, are brought into trouble on our account, or for thesake of the gospel. Joshua would not forsake his new vassals. How muchless shall our true Joshua fail those who trust in Him! We may bewanting in our trust, but our trust never can want success. Yet God'spromises are not to slacken and do away, but to quicken and encourageour endeavours. Notice the great faith of Joshua, and the power of Godanswering it by the miraculous staying of the sun, that the day ofIsrael's victories might be made longer. Joshua acted on this occasionby impulse on his mind from the Spirit of God. It was not necessarythat Joshua should speak, or the miracle be recorded, according to themodern terms of astronomy. The sun appeared to the Israelites overGibeon, and the moon over the valley of Ajalon, and there they appearedto be stopped on their course for one whole day. Is any thing too hardfor the Lord? forms a sufficient answer to ten thousand difficulties,which objectors have in every age started against the truth of God asrevealed in his written word. Proclamation was hereby made to theneighbouring nations, Behold the works of the Lord, and say, Whatnation is there so great as Israel, who has God so nigh unto them?
Jos 10:15-27	<br>None moved his tongue against any of the children of Israel. This showstheir perfect safety. The kings were called to an account, as rebelsagainst the Israel of God. Refuges of lies will but secure for God'sjudgment. God punished the abominable wickedness of these kings, themeasure of whose iniquity was now full. And by this public act ofjustice, done upon these ringleaders of the Canaanites in sin, he wouldpossess his people with the greater dread and detestation of the sinsof the nations that God cast out from before them. Here is a type andfigure of Christ's victories over the powers of darkness, and ofbelievers' victories through him. In our spiritual conflicts we mustnot be satisfied with obtaining some important victory. We must pursueour scattered enemies, searching out the remains of sin as they rise upin our hearts, and thus pursue the conquest. In so doing, the Lord willafford light until the warfare be accomplished.
Jos 10:28-43	<br>Joshua made speed in taking these cities. See what a great deal of workmay be done in a little time, if we will be diligent, and improve ouropportunities. God here showed his hatred of the idolatries and otherabominations of which the Canaanites had been guilty, and shows us howgreat the provocation was, by the greatness of the destruction broughtupon them. Here also was typified the destruction of all the enemies ofthe Lord Jesus, who, having slighted the riches of his grace, must forever feel the weight of his wrath. The Lord fought for Israel. Theycould not have gotten the victory, if God had not undertaken thebattle. We conquer when God fights for us; if he be for us, who can beagainst us?
Jos 11:1-9	<br>The wonders God wrought for the Israelites were to encourage them toact vigorously themselves. Thus the war against Satan's kingdom,carried on by preaching the gospel, was at first forwarded by miracles;but being fully proved to be of God, we are now left to the Divinegrace in the usual course, in the use of the sword of the Spirit. Godencouraged Joshua. Fresh dangers and difficulties make it necessary toseek fresh supports from the word of God, which we have nigh unto usfor use in every time of need. God proportions our trials to ourstrength, and our strength to our trials. Joshua's obedience indestroying the horses and chariots, shows his self-denial in compliancewith God's command. The possession of things on which the carnal heartis prone to depend, is hurtful to the life of faith, and the walk withGod; therefore it is better to be without worldly advantages, than tohave the soul endangered by them. (Jos 11:10-14)
Jos 11:10-14	<br>The Canaanites filled up the measure of their iniquity, and were, as ajudgment, left to the pride, obstinacy, and enmity of their hearts, andto the power of Satan; all restraints being withdrawn, while thedispensations of Providence tended to drive them to despair. Theybrought on themselves the vengeance they justly merited, of which theIsraelites were to be executioners, by the command the Lord gave toMoses.
Jos 11:15-23	<br>Never let the sons of Anak be a terror to the Israel of God, for theirday to fall will come. The land rested from war. It ended not in apeace with the Canaanites, that was forbidden, but in a peace fromthem. There is a rest, a rest from war, remaining for the people ofGod, into which they shall enter, when their warfare is accomplished.That which was now done, is compared with what had been said to Moses.God's word and his works, if viewed together, will be found mutually toset each other forth. If we make conscience of our duty, we need notquestion the performance of the promise. But the believer must neverput off his armour, or expect lasting peace, till he closes his eyes indeath; nay, as his strength and usefulness increase, he may expect moreheavy trials; yet the Lord will not permit any enemies to assault thebeliever till he has prepared him for the battle. Christ Jesus everlives to plead for his people, and their faith shall not fail, howeverSatan may be permitted to assault them. And however tedious, sharp, anddifficult the believer's warfare, his patience in tribulation may beencouraged by the joyfulness of hope; for he will, ere long, rest fromsin and from sorrow in the Canaan above.
Jos 12:1-6	<br>Fresh mercies must not drown the remembrance of former mercies, normust the glory of the present instruments of good to the churchdiminish the just honour of those who went before them, since God isthe same who wrought by both. Moses gave to one part of Israel a veryrich and fruitful country, but it was on the outside of Jordan. Joshuagave to all Israel the holy land, within Jordan. So the law has givento some few of God's spiritual Israel worldly blessings, earnests ofgood things to come; but our Lord Jesus, the true Joshua, provided forall the children of promise spiritual blessings, and the heavenlyCanaan.
Jos 12:7-24	<br>We have here the limits of the country Joshua conquered. A list isgiven of the kings subdued by Israel: thirty-one in all. This shows howfruitful Canaan then was, in which so many chose to throng together.This was the land God appointed for Israel; yet in our day it is one ofthe most barren and unprofitable countries in the world. Such is theeffect of the curse it lies under, since its possessors rejected Christand his gospel, as was foretold by Moses, De 29:23. The vengeance of arighteous God, inflicted on all these kings and their subjects, fortheir wickedness, should make us dread and hate sin. The fruitful landbestowed on his chosen people, should fill our hearts with hope andconfidence in his mercy, and with humble gratitude.
Jos 13:1-6	<br>At this chapter begins the account of the dividing of the land ofCanaan among the tribes of Israel by lot; a narrative showing theperformance of the promise made to the fathers, that this land shouldbe given to the seed of Jacob. We are not to pass over these chaptersof hard names as useless. Where God has a mouth to speak, and a hand towrite, we should find an ear to hear, and an eye to read; and may Godgive us a heart to profit! Joshua is supposed to have been about onehundred years old at this time. It is good for those who are old andstricken in years to be put in remembrance of their being so. Godconsiders the frame of his people, and would not have them burdenedwith work above their strength. And all people, especially old people,should set to do that quickly which must be done before they die, lestdeath prevent them, Ec 9:10. God promise that he would make theIsraelites masters of all the countries yet unsubdued, through Joshuawas old, and not able to do it; old, and not likely to live to see itdone. Whatever becomes of us, and however we may be laid aside asdespised, broken vessels, God will do his own work in his own time. Wemust work out our salvation, then God will work in us, and work withus; we must resist our spiritual enemies, then God will tread themunder our feet; we must go forth to our Christian work and warfare,then God will go forth before us.
Jos 13:7-33	<br>The land must be divided among the tribes. It is the will of God thatevery man should know his own, and not take that which is another's.The world must be governed, not by force, but right. Wherever ourhabitation is placed, and in whatever honest way our portion isassigned, we should consider them as allotted of God; we should bethankful for, and use them as such, while every prudent method shouldbe used to prevent disputes about property, both at present and infuture. Joshua must be herein a type of Christ, who has not onlyconquered the gates of hell for us, but has opened to us the gates ofheaven, and having purchased the eternal inheritance for all believers,will put them in possession of it. Here is a general description of thecountry given to the two tribes and a half, by Moses. Israel must knowtheir own, and keep to it; and may not, under pretence of their beingGod's peculiar people, encroach on their neighbours. Twice in thischapter it is noticed, that to the tribe of Levi Moses gave noinheritance: see Nu 18:20. Their maintenance must be brought out of allthe tribes. The ministers of the Lord should show themselvesindifferent about worldly interests, and the people should take carethey want nothing suitable. And happy are those who have the Lord Godof Israel for their inheritance, though little of this world falls totheir lot. His providences will supply their wants, his consolationswill support their souls, till they gain heavenly joy and everlastingpleasures.
Jos 14:1-5	<br>The Israelites must occupy the new conquests. Canaan would have beensubdued in vain, if it had not been inhabited. Yet every man might notgo and settle where he pleased. God shall choose our inheritance forus. Let us survey our heritage of present mercy, our prospect for theland of promise, eternal in the heavens. Is God any respecter ofpersons? Is it not better that our place, as to earthly good or sorrow,should be determined by the infinite wisdom of our heavenly Father,than by our own ignorance? Should not those for whom the great mysteryof godliness was exhibited, those whose redemption was purchased byJesus Christ, thankfully refer their earthly concerns to hisappointment?
Jos 14:6-15	<br>Caleb's request is, "Give me this mountain," or Hebron, because it wasformerly in God's promise to him, and he would let Israel knows howmuch he valued the promise. Those who live by faith value that which isgiven by God's promise, far above what is given by his providence only.It was now in the Anakims' possession, and Caleb would let Israel knowhow little he feared the enemy, and that he would encourage them topush on their conquests. Caleb answered to his name, which signifies"all heart." Hebron was settled on Caleb and his heirs, because hewholly followed the Lord God of Israel. Happy are we if we follow him.Singular piety shall be crowned with singular favour.
Jos 15:1-12	<br>Joshua allotted to Judah, Ephraim, and the half of Manasseh, theirinheritances before they left Gilgal. Afterwards removing to Shiloh,another survey was made, and the other tribes had their portionassigned. In due time all God's people are settled.
Jos 15:13-19	<br>Achsah obtained some land by Caleb's free grant. He gave her a southland. Land indeed, but a south land, dry and apt to be parched. Sheobtained more, on her request, and he gave the upper and the nethersprings. Those who understand it but of one field, watered both withthe rain of heaven, and the springs that issued out of the earth,countenance the allusion commonly made to this, when we pray forspiritual and heavenly blessings which relate to our souls, asblessings of the upper springs, and those which relate to the body andthe life that now is, as blessings of the nether springs. All theblessings, both of the upper and the nether springs, belong to thechildren of God. As related to Christ, they have them freely given ofthe Father, for the lot of their inheritance.
Jos 15:20-63	<br>Here is a list of the cities of Judah. But we do not here findBethlehem, afterwards the city of David, and ennobled by the birth ofour Lord Jesus in it. That city, which, at the best, was but littleamong the thousands of Judah, Mic 5:2, except that it was thushonoured, was now so little as not to be accounted one of the cities.
Jos 17:1-6	<br>Manasseh was but half of the tribe of Joseph, yet it was divided intotwo parts. The daughters of Zelophehad now reaped the benefit of theirpious zeal and prudent forecast. Those who take care in the wildernessof this world, to make sure to themselves a place in the inheritance ofthe saints in light, will have the comfort of it in the other world;while those who neglect it now, will lose it for ever. Lord, teach ushere to believe and obey, and give us an inheritance among thy saints,in glory everlasting.
Jos 17:7-13	<br>There was great communication between Manasseh and Ephraim. Though eachtribe had its inheritance, yet they should intermix one with another,to do good offices one to another, as became those, who, though ofdifferent tribes, were all one Israel, and were bound to love asbrethren. But they suffered the Canaanites to live among them, againstthe command of God, to serve their own ends.
Jos 17:14-18	<br>Joshua, as a public person, had no more regard to his own tribe than toany other, but would govern without favour or affection; wherein he hasleft a good example to all in public trusts. Joshua tells them, thatwhat was fallen to their share would be a sufficient lot for them, ifthey would but work and fight. Men excuse themselves from labour by anypretence; and nothing serves the purpose better than having rich andpowerful relations, able to provide for them; and they are apt todesire a partial and unfaithful disposal of what is intrusted to thosethey think able to give such help. But there is more real kindness inpointing out the advantages within reach, and in encouraging men tomake the best of them, than in granting indulgences to sloth andextravagance. True religion gives no countenance to these evils. Therule is, They shall not eat who will not work; and many of our"cannots" are only the language of idleness, which magnifies everydifficulty and danger. This is especially the case in our spiritualwork and warfare. Without Christ we can do nothing, but we are apt tosit still and attempt nothing. if we belong to Him, he will stir us upto our best endeavours, and to cry to him for help. Then our coast willbe enlarged, 1Ch 4:9,10, and complainings silenced, or rather, turnedinto joyful thanksgivings.
Jos 18:2-10	<br>After a year or more, Joshua blamed their slackness, and told them howto proceed. God, by his grace, has given us a title to a good land, theheavenly Canaan, but we are slack to take possession of it; we enternot into that rest, as we might by faith, and hope, and holy joy. Howlong shall it be thus with us? How long shall we thus stand in our ownlight, and forsake our own mercies for lying vanities? Joshua stirs theIsraelites up to take possession of their lots. He is ready to do hispart, if they will do theirs.
Jos 18:11-28	<br>The boundaries of each portion were distinctly drawn, and theinheritance of each tribe settled. All contests and selfish claims wereprevented by the wise appointment of God, who allotted the hill and thevalley, the corn and pasture, the brooks and rivers, the towns andcities. Is the lot of any servant of Christ cast in affliction andsorrow? It is the Lord; let him do what seemeth him good. Are we inprosperity and peace? It is from above. Be humbled when you compare thegift with your own unworthiness. Forget not Him that gave the good, andalways be ready to resign it at his command.
Jos 19:1-9	<br>The men of Judah did not oppose taking away the cities within theirborder, when convinced that they had more than was right. If a truebeliever has obtained an unintended and improper advantage in anything, he will give it up without murmuring. Love seeketh not her own,and doth not behave unseemly; it will induce those in whom it richlydwells, to part with their own to supply what is lacking to theirbrethren.
Jos 19:10-16	<br>In the division to each tribe of Israel, the prophetic blessings ofJacob were fulfilled. They chose for themselves, or it was divided tothem by lot, in the manner and places that he foresaw. So sure a ruleto go by is the word of prophecy: we see by it what to believe, and itproves beyond all dispute the things that are of God.
Jos 19:17-51	<br>Joshua waited till all the tribes were settled, before he asked anyprovision for himself. He was content to be unfixed, till he saw themall placed, and herein is an example to all in public places, to preferthe common welfare before private advantage. Those who labour most todo good to others, seek an inheritance in the Canaan above: but it willbe soon enough to enter thereon, when they have done all the service totheir brethren of which they are capable. Nor can any thing moreeffectually assure them of their title to it, than endeavouring tobring others to desire, to seek, and to obtain it. Our Lord Jesus cameand dwelt on earth, not in pomp but poverty, providing rest for man,yet himself not having where to lay his head; for Christ pleased nothimself. Nor would he enter upon his inheritance, till by his obedienceto death he secured the eternal inheritance for all his people; norwill he account his own glory completed, till every ransomed sinner isput in possession of his heavenly rest.
Jos 20:1-6	<br>When the Israelites were settled in their promised inheritance, theywere reminded to set apart the cities of refuge, whose use and typicalmeaning have been explained, Nu 35; De 19. God's spiritual Israel have,and shall have in Christ and heaven, not only rest to repose in, butrefuge to secure themselves in. These cities were designed to typifythe relief which the gospel provides for penitent sinners, and theirprotection from the curse of the law and the wrath of God, in our LordJesus, to whom believers flee for refuge, Heb 6:18.
Jos 20:7-9	<br>These cities, as those also on the other side Jordan, stood so that aman might in half a day reach one of them from any part of the country.God is ever a Refuge at hand. They were all Levites' cities. It waskindness to the poor fugitive, that when he might not go up to thehouse of the Lord, yet he had the servants of God with him, to instructhim, and pray for him, and to help to make up the want of publicordinances. Some observe a significance in the names of these citieswith application to Christ our Refuge. Kedesh signifies holy, and ourRefuge is the holy Jesus. Shechem, a shoulder, and the government isupon his shoulder. Hebron, fellowship, and believers are called intothe fellowship of Christ Jesus our Lord. Bezer, a fortification, for heis a strong hold to all those that trust in him. Ramoth, high orexalted, for Him hath God exalted with his own right hand. Golan, joyor exultation, for in Him all the saints are justified, and shallglory.
Jos 21:1-8	<br>The Levites waited till the other tribes were provided for, before theypreferred their claim to Joshua. They build their claim upon a verygood foundation; not their own merits or services, but the Divineprecept. The maintenance of ministers is not a thing left merely to thewill of the people, that they may let them starve if they please; theywhich preach the gospel should live by the gospel, and should livecomfortably. (Jos 21:9-42)
Jos 21:9-42	<br>By mixing the Levites with the other tribes, they were made to see thatthe eyes of all Israel were upon them, and therefore it was theirconcern to walk so that their ministry might not be blamed. Every tribehad its share of Levites' cities. Thus did God graciously provide forkeeping up religion among them, and that they might have the word inall parts of the land. Yet, blessed be God, we have the gospel morediffused amongst us. (Jos 21:43-45)
Jos 21:43-45	<br>God promised to give to the seed of Abraham the land of Canaan for apossession, and now they possessed it, and dwelt therein. And thepromise of the heavenly Canaan is as sure to all God's spiritualIsrael; for it is the promise of Him that cannot lie. There stood not aman before them. The after-prevalence of the Canaanites was the effectof Israel's slothfulness, and the punishment of their sinfulinclination to the idolatries and abominations of the heathen whom theyharboured and indulged. There failed not aught of any good thing, whichthe Lord had spoken to the house of Israel. In due season all hispromises will be accomplished; then will his people acknowledge thatthe Lord has exceeded their largest expectations, and made them morethan conquerors, and brought them to their desired rest.
Jos 22:1-9	<br>Joshua dismisses the tribes with good counsel. Those who have thecommandment have it in vain, unless they do the commandment; and itwill not be done aright unless we take diligent heed. In particular tolove the Lord our God, as the best of beings, and the best of friends;and as far as that principle rules in the heart, there will be constantcare and endeavour to walk in his ways, even those that are narrow andup-hill. In every instance to keep his commandments. At all times, andin all conditions, with purpose of heart to cleave unto the Lord, andto serve him and his kingdom among men, with all our heart, and withall our soul. This good counsel is given to all; may God give us graceto take it!
Jos 22:10-20	<br>Here is the care of the separated tribes to keep their hold of Canaan'sreligion. At first sight it seemed a design to set up an altar againstthe altar at Shiloh. God is jealous for his own institutions; we shouldbe so too, and afraid of every thing that looks like, or leads toidolatry. Corruptions in religion are best dealt with at first. Buttheir prudence in following up this zealous resolution is no lesscommendable. Many an unhappy strife would be prevented, or soon madeup, by inquiries into the matter of the offence. The remembrance ofgreat sins committed formerly, should engage us to stand on our guardagainst the beginnings of sin; for the way of sin is down-hill. We areall concerned to reprove our neighbour when he does amiss, lest wesuffer sin upon him, Le 19:17. The offer made that they should bewelcome to come to the land where the Lord's tabernacle was, and settlethere, was in the spirit of true Israelites.
Jos 22:21-29	<br>The tribes took the reproofs of their brethren in good part. Withsolemnity and meekness they proceeded to give all the satisfaction intheir power. Reverence of God is expressed in the form of their appeal.This brief confession of faith would remove their brethren's suspicionthat they intended to worship other gods. Let us always speak of Godwith seriousness, and mention his name with a solemn pause. Those whomake appeals to Heaven with a careless "God knows," take his name invain: it is very unlike this. They express great confidence of theirown uprightness in the matter of their appeal. "God knows it," for heis perfectly acquainted with the thoughts and intents of the heart. Inevery thing we do in religion, it highly concerns us to approveourselves to God, remembering that he knows the heart. And if oursincerity be known to God, we should study likewise to let others knowit by its fruits, especially those who, though they mistake us, showzeal for the glory of God. They disdained the design of which they weresuspected to be guilty, and fully explained their true intent inbuilding this altar. Those who have found the comfort and benefit ofGod's ordinances, cannot but desire to preserve them to their seed, andto use all possible care that their children may be looked upon ashaving a part in him. Christ is the great Altar that sanctifies everygift; the best evidence of our interest in him is the work of hisSpirit in our hearts.
Jos 22:30-34	<br>It is well that there was on both sides a disposition to peace, asthere was a zeal for God; for quarrels about religion, for want ofwisdom and love, often prove the most fierce and difficult to be madeup. Proud and peevish spirits, when they have passed any unjust blameon their brethren, though full evidence be brought of its unfairness,can by no means be persuaded to withdraw it. But Israel was not soprejudiced. They looked upon their brethren's innocence as a token ofGod's presence. Our brethren's zeal for the power of godliness, andfaith and love, notwithstanding the fears of their breaking the unityof the church, are things of which we should be very glad to besatisfied. The altar was called ED, a witness. It was a witness oftheir care to keep their religion pure and entire, and would witnessagainst their descendants, if they should turn from following after theLord. Happy will it be when all professed Christians learn to copy theexample of Israel, to unite zeal and steady adherence to the cause oftruth, with candour, meekness, and readiness to understand each other,to explain and to be satisfied with the explanations of their brethren.May the Lord increase the number of those who endeavour to keep theunity of the Spirit in the bond of peace! may increasing grace andconsolation be with all who love Jesus Christ in sincerity!
Jos 23:1-10	<br>Joshua was old and dying, let them observe what he said now. He putthem in mind of the great things God had done for them in his days. Heexhorted them to be very courageous. Keep with care, do with diligence,and regard with sincerity what is written. Also, very cautiously toendeavour that the heathen idolatry may be forgotten, so that it maynever be revived. It is sad that among Christians the names of theheathen gods are so commonly used, and made so familiar as they are.Joshua exhorts them to be very constant. There might be many thingsamiss among them, but they had not forsaken the Lord their God; the wayto make people better, is to make the best of them.
Jos 23:11-16	<br>Would we cleave to the Lord, we must always stand upon our guard, formany a soul is lost through carelessness. Love the Lord your God, andyou will not leave him. Has God been thus true to you? Be not you falseto him. He is faithful that has promised, Heb 10:23. The experience ofevery Christian witnesses the same truth. Conflicts may have beensevere and long, trials great and many; but at the last he willacknowledge that goodness and mercy followed him all the days of hislife. Joshua states the fatal consequences of going back; know for acertainty it will be your ruin. The first step would be, friendshipwith idolaters; the next would be, marrying with them; the end of thatwould be, serving their gods. Thus the way of sin is down-hill, andthose who have fellowship with sinners, cannot avoid having fellowshipwith sin. He describes the destruction he warns them of. The goodnessof the heavenly Canaan, and the free and sure grant God has made of it,will add to the misery of those who shall for ever be shut out from it.Nothing will make them see how wretched they are, so much, as to seehow happy they might have been. Let us watch and pray againsttemptation. Let us trust in God's faithfulness, love, and power; let usplead his promises, and cleave to his commandments, then we shall behappy in life, in death, and for ever.
Jos 24:1-14	<br>We must never think our work for God done, till our life is done. If helengthen out our days beyond what we expected, like those of Joshua, itis because he has some further service for us to do. He who aims at thesame mind which was in Christ Jesus, will glory in bearing the lasttestimony to his Saviour's goodness, and in telling to all around, theobligations with which the unmerited goodness of God has bound him. Theassembly came together in a solemn religious manner. Joshua spake tothem in God's name, and as from him. His sermon consists of doctrineand application. The doctrinal part is a history of the great thingsGod had done for his people, and for their fathers before them. Theapplication of this history of God's mercies to them, is an exhortationto fear and serve God, in gratitude for his favour, and that it mightbe continued.
Jos 24:15-28	<br>It is essential that the service of God's people be performed with awilling mind. For LOVE is the only genuine principle whence allacceptable service of God can spring. The Father seeks only such toworship him, as worship him in spirit and in truth. The carnal mind ofman is enmity against God, therefore, is not capable of such spiritualworship. Hence the necessity of being born again. But numbers rest inmere forms, as tasks imposed upon them. Joshua puts them to theirchoice; but not as if it were indifferent whether they served God ornot. Choose you whom ye will serve, now the matter is laid plainlybefore you. He resolves to do this, whatever others did. Those that arebound for heaven, must be willing to swim against the stream. They mustnot do as the most do, but as the best do. And no one can behavehimself as he ought in any station, who does not deeply consider hisreligious duties in family relations. The Israelites agree with Joshua,being influenced by the example of a man who had been so great ablessing to them; We also will serve the Lord. See how much good greatmen do, by their influence, if zealous in religion. Joshua brings themto express full purpose of heart to cleave to the Lord. They must comeoff from all confidence in their own sufficiency, else their purposeswould be in vain. The service of God being made their deliberatechoice, Joshua binds them to it by a solemn covenant. He set up amonument of it. In this affecting manner Joshua took his last leave ofthem; if they perished, their blood would be upon their own heads.Though the house of God, the Lord's table, and even the walls and treesbefore which we have uttered our solemn purposes of serving him, wouldbear witness against us if we deny him, yet we may trust in him, thathe will put his fear into our hearts, that we shall not depart fromhim. God alone can give grace, yet he blesses our endeavours to engagemen to his service.
Jos 24:29-33	<br>Joseph died in Egypt, but gave commandment concerning his bones, thatthey should not rest in their grave till Israel had rest in the land ofpromise. Notice also the death and burial of Joshua, and of Eleazar thechief priest. The most useful men, having served their generation,according to the will of God, one after another, fall asleep and seecorruption. But Jesus, having spent and ended his life on earth moreeffectually than either Joshua or Joseph, rose from the dead, and sawno corruption. And the redeemed of the Lord shall inherit the kingdomhe prepared for them from the foundation of the world. They will say inadmiration of the grace of Jesus, Unto him that loved us, and washed usfrom our sins in his own blood, and hath made us kings and priests untoGod and his Father, to him be glory and dominion for ever and ever.Amen.
Jdg 1:1-8	<br>The Israelites were convinced that the war against the Canaanites wasto be continued; but they were in doubt as to the manner in which itwas to be carried on after the death of Joshua. In these respects theyinquired of the Lord. God appoints service according to the strength hehas given. From those who are most able, most work is expected. Judahwas first in dignity, and must be first in duty. Judah's service willnot avail unless God give success; but God will not give the success,unless Judah applies to the service. Judah was the most considerable ofall the tribes, and Simeon the least; yet Judah begs Simeon'sfriendship, and prays for aid from him. It becomes Israelites to helpone another against Canaanites; and all Christians, even those ofdifferent tribes, should strengthen one another. Those who thus helpone another in love, have reason to hope that God will graciously helpboth. Adoni-bezek was taken prisoner. This prince had been a severetyrant. The Israelites, doubtless under the Divine direction, made himsuffer what he had done to others; and his own conscience confessedthat he was justly treated as he had treated others. Thus the righteousGod sometimes, in his providence, makes the punishment answer the sin.
Jdg 1:9-20	<br>The Canaanites had iron chariots; but Israel had God on their side,whose chariots are thousands of angels, Ps 68:17. Yet they sufferedtheir fears to prevail against their faith. About Caleb we read in Jos15:16-19. The Kenites had settled in the land. Israel let them fixwhere they pleased, being a quiet, contented people. They that molestednone, were molested by none. Blessed are the meek, for they shallinherit the earth.
Jdg 1:21-36	<br>The people of Israel were very careless of their duty and interest.Owing to slothfulness and cowardice, they would not be at the pains tocomplete their conquests. It was also owing to their covetousness: theywere willing to let the Canaanites live among them, that they mightmake advantage of them. They had not the dread and detestation ofidolatry they ought to have had. The same unbelief that kept theirfathers forty years out of Canaan, kept them now out of the fullpossession of it. Distrust of the power and promise of God deprivedthem of advantages, and brought them into troubles. Thus many abeliever who begins well is hindered. His graces languish, his lustsrevive, Satan plies him with suitable temptations, the world recoversits hold; he brings guilt into his conscience, anguish into his heart,discredit on his character, and reproach on the gospel. Though he mayhave sharp rebukes, and be so recovered that he does not perish, yet hewill have deeply to lament his folly through his remaining days; andupon his dying bed to mourn over the opportunities of glorifying Godand serving the church he has lost. We can have no fellowship with theenemies of God within us or around us, but to our hurt; therefore ouronly wisdom is to maintain unceasing war against them.
Jdg 2:1-5	<br>It was the great Angel of the covenant, the Word, the Son of God, whospake with Divine authority as Jehovah, and now called them to accountfor their disobedience. God sets forth what he had done for Israel, andwhat he had promised. Those who throw off communion with God, and havefellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, know not what they donow, and will have nothing to say for themselves in the day of accountshortly. They must expect to suffer for this their folly. Those deceivethemselves who expect advantages from friendship with God's enemies.God often makes men's sin their punishment; and thorns and snares arein the way of the froward, who will walk contrary to God. The peoplewept, crying out against their own folly and ingratitude. They trembledat the word, and not without cause. It is a wonder sinners can everread the Bible with dry eyes. Had they kept close to God and theirduty, no voice but that of singing had been heard in theircongregation; but by their sin and folly they made other work forthemselves, and nothing is to be heard but the voice of weeping. Theworship of God, in its own nature, is joy, praise, and thanksgiving;our sins alone render weeping needful. It is pleasing to see men weepfor their sins; but our tears, prayers, and even amendment, cannotatone for sin.
Jdg 2:6-23	<br>We have a general idea of the course of things in Israel, during thetime of the Judges. The nation made themselves as mean and miserable byforsaking God, as they would have been great and happy if they hadcontinued faithful to him. Their punishment answered to the evil theyhad done. They served the gods of the nations round about them, eventhe meanest, and God made them serve the princes of the nations roundabout them, even the meanest. Those who have found God true to hispromises, may be sure that he will be as true to his threatenings. Hemight in justice have abandoned them, but he could not for pity do it.The Lord was with the judges when he raised them up, and so they becamesaviours. In the days of the greatest distress of the church, thereshall be some whom God will find or make fit to help it. The Israeliteswere not thoroughly reformed; so mad were they upon their idols, and soobstinately bent to backslide. Thus those who have forsaken the goodways of God, which they have once known and professed, commonly growmost daring and desperate in sin, and have their hearts hardened. Theirpunishment was, that the Canaanites were spared, and so they werebeaten with their own rod. Men cherish and indulge their corruptappetites and passions; therefore God justly leaves them to themselves,under the power of their sins, which will be their ruin. God has toldus how deceitful and desperately wicked our hearts are, but we are notwilling to believe it, until by making bold with temptation we find ittrue by sad experience. We need to examine how matters stand withourselves, and to pray without ceasing, that we may be rooted andgrounded in love, and that Christ may dwell in our hearts by faith. Letus declare war against every sin, and follow after holiness all ourdays.
Jdg 3:1-7	<br>As the Israelites were a type of the church on earth, they were not tobe idle and slothful. The Lord was pleased to try them by the remainsof the devoted nations they spared. Temptations and trials detect thewickedness of the hearts of sinners; and strengthen he graces ofbelievers in their daily conflict with Satan, sin, and this evil world.They must live in this world, but they are not of it, and are forbiddento conform to it. This marks the difference between the followers ofChrist and mere professors. The friendship of the world is more fatalthan its enmity; the latter can only kill the body, but the formermurders many precious souls.
Jdg 3:8-11	<br>The first judge was Othniel: even in Joshua's time Othniel began to befamous. Soon after Israel's settlement in Canaan their purity began tobe corrupted, and their peace disturbed. But affliction makes those cryto God who before would scarcely speak to him. God returned in mercy tothem for their deliverance. The Spirit of the Lord came upon Othniel.The Spirit of wisdom and courage to qualify him for the service, andthe Spirit of power to excite him to it. He first judged Israel,reproved and reformed them, and then went to war. Let sin at home beconquered, that worst of enemies, then enemies abroad will be moreeasily dealt with. Thus let Christ be our Judge and Lawgiver, then hewill save us.
Jdg 3:12-30	<br>When Israel sins again, God raises up a new oppressor. The Israelitesdid ill, and the Moabites did worse; yet because God punishes the sinsof his own people in this world, Israel is weakened, and Moabstrengthened against them. If lesser troubles do not do the work, Godwill send greater. When Israel prays again, God raises up Ehud. As ajudge, or minister of Divine justice, Ehud put to death Eglon, the kingof Moab, and thus executed the judgments of God upon him as an enemy toGod and Israel. But the law of being subject to principalities andpowers in all things lawful, is the rule of our conduct. No suchcommissions are now given; to pretend to them is to blaspheme God.Notice Ehud's address to Eglon. What message from God but a message ofvengeance can a proud rebel expect? Such a message is contained in theword of God; his ministers are boldly to declare it, without fearingthe frown, or respecting the persons of sinners. But, blessed be God,they have to deliver a message of mercy and of free salvation; themessage of vengeance belongs only to those who neglect the offers ofgrace. The consequence of this victory was, that the land had resteighty years. It was a great while for the land to rest; yet what isthat to the saints' everlasting rest in the heavenly Canaan.<br>Verse 31<br>The side of the country which lay south-west, was infested by thePhilistines. God raised up Shamgar to deliver them; having neithersword nor spear, he took an ox-goad, the instrument next at hand. Godcan make those serviceable to his glory and to his church's good, whosebirth, education, and employment, are mean and obscure. It is no matterwhat the weapon is, if God directs and strengthens the arm. Often heworks by unlikely means, that the excellency of the power may appear tobe of God.
Jdg 4:1-3	<br>The land had rest for eighty years, which should have confirmed them intheir religion; but it made them secure, and indulge their lusts. Thusthe prosperity of fools destroys them. Jabin and his general Sisera,mightily oppressed Israel. This enemy was nearer than any of theformer. Israel cried unto the Lord, when distress drove them to him,and they saw no other way of relief. Those who slight God inprosperity, will find themselves under a necessity of seeking him introuble.
Jdg 4:4-9	<br>Deborah was a prophetess; one instructed in Divine knowledge by theinspiration of the Spirit of God. She judged Israel as God's mouth tothem; correcting abuses, and redressing grievances. By God's direction,she ordered Barak to raise an army, and engage Jabin's forces. Barakinsisted much upon her presence. Deborah promised to go with him. Shewould not send him where she would not go herself. Those who in God'sname call others to their duty, should be ready to assist them in it.Barak values the satisfaction of his mind, and the good success of hisenterprise, more than mere honour.
Jdg 4:10-16	<br>Siser's confidence was chiefly in his chariots. But if we have groundto hope that God goes before us, we may go on with courage andcheerfulness. Be not dismayed at the difficulties thou meetest with inresisting Satan, in serving God, or suffering for him; for is not theLord gone before thee? Follow him then fully. Barak went down, thoughupon the plain the iron chariots would have advantage against him: hequitted the mountain in dependence on the Divine power; for in the Lordalone is the salvation of his people, Jer 3:23. He was not deceived inhis confidence. When God goes before us in our spiritual conflicts, wemust bestir ourselves; and when, by his grace, he gives us some successagainst the enemies of our souls, we must improve it by watchfulnessand resolution.
Jdg 4:17-24	<br>Sisera's chariots had been his pride and his confidence. Thus are thosedisappointed who rest on the creature; like a broken reed, it not onlybreaks under them, but pierces them with many sorrows. The idol mayquickly become a burden, Isa 46:1; what we were sick for, God can makeus sick of. It is probable that Jael really intended kindness toSisera; but by a Divine impulse she was afterwards led to consider himas the determined enemy of the Lord and of his people, and to destroyhim. All our connexions with God's enemies must be broken off, if wewould have the Lord for our God, and his people for our people. He thathad thought to have destroyed Israel with his many iron chariots, ishimself destroyed with one iron nail. Thus the weak things of the worldconfound the mighty. The Israelites would have prevented much mischief,if they had sooner destroyed the Canaanites, as God commanded andenabled them: but better be wise late, and buy wisdom by experience,than never be wise.
Jdg 5:1-5	<br>No time should be lost in returning thanks to the Lord for his mercies;for our praises are most acceptable, pleasant, and profitable, whenthey flow from a full heart. By this, love and gratitude would be moreexcited and more deeply fixed in the hearts of believers; the eventswould be more known and longer remembered. Whatever Deborah, Barak, orthe army had done, the Lord must have all the praise. The will, thepower, and the success were all from Him.
Jdg 5:6-11	<br>Deborah describes the distressed state of Israel under the tyranny ofJabin, that their salvation might appear more gracious. She shows whatbrought this misery upon them. It was their idolatry. They chose newgods, with new names. But under all these images, Satan was worshipped.Deborah was a mother to Israel, by diligently promoting the salvationof their souls. She calls on those who shared the advantages of thisgreat salvation, to offer up thanks to God for it. Let such as arerestored, not only to their liberty as other Israelites, but to theirrank, speak God's praises. This is the Lord's doing. In these acts ofhis, justice was executed on his enemies. In times of persecution,God's ordinances, the walls of salvation, whence the waters of life aredrawn, are resorted to at the hazard of the lives of those who attendthem. At all times Satan will endeavour to hinder the believer fromdrawing near to the throne of grace. Notice God's kindness to histrembling people. It is the glory of God to protect those who are mostexposed, and to help the weakest. Let us notice the benefit we havefrom the public peace, the inhabitants of villages especially, and giveGod the praise.
Jdg 5:12-23	<br>Deborah called on her own soul to be in earnest. He that will set thehearts of other men on fire with the love of Christ, must himself burnwith love. Praising God is a work we should awake to, and awakeourselves unto. She notices who fought against Israel, who fought forthem, and who kept away. Who fought against them. They were obstinateenemies to God's people, therefore the more dangerous. Who fought forthem. The several tribes that helped are here spoken of with honour;for though God is above all to be glorified, those who are employedmust have their due praise, to encourage others. But the whole creationis at war with those to whom God is an enemy. The river of Kishonfought against their enemies. At most times it was shallow, yet now,probably by the great rain that fell, it was so swelled, and the streamso deep and strong, that those who attempted to pass, were drowned.Deborah's own soul fought against them. When the soul is employed inholy exercises, and heart-work is made of them, through the grace ofGod, the strength of our spiritual enemies will be trodden down, andwill fall before us. She observes who kept away, and did not side withIsrael, as might have been expected. Thus many are kept from doingtheir duty by the fear of trouble, the love of ease, and undueaffection to their worldly business and advantage. Narrow, selfishspirits care not what becomes of God's church, so that they can butget, keep, and save money. All seek their own, Php 2:21. A little willserve those for a pretence to stay at home, who have no mind to engagein needful services, because there is difficulty and danger in them.But we cannot keep away from the contest between the Lord and hisenemies; and if we do not actively endeavour to promote his cause inthis wicked world, we shall fall under the curse against the workers ofiniquity. Though He needs no human help, yet he is pleased to acceptthe services of those who improve their talents to advance his cause.He requires every man to do so.
Jdg 5:24-31	<br>Jael had a special blessing. Those whose lot is cast in the tent, in alow and narrow sphere, if they serve God according to the powers he hasgiven them, shall not lose their reward. The mother of Sisera lookedfor his return, not in the least fearing his success. Let us take heedof indulging eager desires towards any temporal good, particularlytoward that which cherishes vain-glory, for that was what she heredoted on. What a picture does she present of an ungodly and sensualheart! How shameful and childish these wishes of an aged mother and herattendants for her son! And thus does God often bring ruin on hisenemies when they are most puffed up. Deborah concludes with a prayerto God for the destruction of all his foes, and for the comfort of allhis friends. Such shall be the honour, and joy of all who love God insincerity, they shall shine for ever as the sun in the firmament.
Jdg 6:1-6	<br>Israel's sin was renewed, and Israel's troubles were repeated. Let allthat sin expect to suffer. The Israelites hid themselves in dens andcaves; such was the effect of a guilty conscience. Sin dispirits men.The invaders left no food for Israel, except what was taken into thecaves. They prepared that for Baal with which God should have beenserved, now God justly sends an enemy to take it away in the seasonthereof.
Jdg 6:7-10	<br>They cried to God for a deliverer, and he sent them a prophet to teachthem. When God furnishes a land with faithful ministers, it is a tokenthat he has mercy in store for it. He charges them with rebellionagainst the Lord; he intends to bring them to repentance. Repentance isreal when the sinfulness of sin, as disobedience to God, is chieflylamented.
Jdg 6:11-24	<br>Gideon was a man of a brave, active spirit, yet in obscurity throughthe times: he is here stirred up to undertake something great. It wasvery sure that the Lord was with him, when his Angel was with him.Gideon was weak in faith, which made it hard to reconcile theassurances of the presence of God with the distress to which Israel wasbrought. The Angel answered his objections. He told him to appear andact as Israel's deliverer, there needed no more. Bishop Hall says,While God calls Gideon valiant, he makes him so. God delights toadvance the humble. Gideon desires to have his faith confirmed. Now,under the influences of the Spirit, we are not to expect signs beforeour eyes such as Gideon here desired, but must earnestly pray to God,that if we have found grace in his sight, he would show us a sign inour heart, by the powerful working of his Spirit there, The Angelturned the meat into an offering made by fire; showing that he was nota man who needed meat, but the Son of God, who was to be served andhonoured by sacrifice, and who in the fulness of time was to makehimself a sacrifice. Hereby a sign was given to Gideon, that he hadfound grace in God's sight. Ever since man has by sin exposed himselfto God's wrath and curse, a message from heaven has been a terror tohim, as he scarcely dares to expect good tidings thence. In this world,it is very awful to have any converse with that world of spirits towhich we are so much strangers. Gideon's courage failed him. But Godspoke peace to him.
Jdg 6:25-32	<br>See the power of God's grace, that he could raise up a reformer; andthe kindness of his grace, that he would raise up a deliverer, out ofthe family of a leader in idolatry. Gideon must not think it enough notto worship at that altar; he must throw it down, and offer sacrifice onanother. It was needful he should make peace with God, before he madewar on Midian. Till sin be pardoned through the great Sacrifice, nogood is to be expected. God, who has all hearts in his hands,influenced Joash to appear for his son against the advocates for Baal,though he had joined formerly in the worship of Baal. Let us do ourduty, and trust God with our safety. Here is a challenge to Baal, to doeither good or evil; the result convinced his worshippers of theirfolly, in praying to one to help them that could not avenge himself.
Jdg 6:33-40	<br>These signs are truly miraculous, and very significant. Gideon and hismen were going to fight the Midianites; could God distinguish between asmall fleece of Israel, and the vast floor of Midian? Gideon is made toknow that God could do so. Is Gideon desirous that the dew of Divinegrace might come down upon himself in particular? He sees the fleecewet with dew to assure him of it. Does he desire that God will be asthe dew to all Israel? Behold, all the ground is wet. What cause wesinners of the Gentiles have, to bless the Lord that the dew ofheavenly blessings, once confined to Israel, is now sent to all theinhabitants of the earth! Yet still the means of grace are in differentmeasures, according to the purposes of God. In the same congregation,one man's soul is like Gideon's moistened fleece, another like the dryground.
Jdg 7:1-8	<br>God provides that the praise of victory may be wholly to himself, byappointing only three hundred men to be employed. Activity and prudencego with dependence upon God for help in our lawful undertakings. Whenthe Lord sees that men would overlook him, and through unbelief, wouldshrink from perilous services, or that through pride they would vauntthemselves against him, he will set them aside, and do his work byother instruments. Pretences will be found by many, for deserting thecause and escaping the cross. But though a religious society may thusbe made fewer in numbers, yet it will gain as to purity, and may expectan increased blessing from the Lord. God chooses to employ such as arenot only well affected, but zealously affected in a good thing. Theygrudged not at the liberty of the others who were dismissed. In doingthe duties required by God, we must not regard the forwardness orbackwardness of others, nor what they do, but what God looks for at ourhands. He is a rare person who can endure that others should excel himin gifts or blessings, or in liberty; so that we may say, it is by thespecial grace of God that we regard what God says to us, and not lookto men what they do.
Jdg 7:9-15	<br>The dream seemed to have little meaning in it; but the interpretationevidently proved the whole to be from the Lord, and discovered that thename of Gideon had filled the Midianites with terror. Gideon took thisas a sure pledge of success; without delay he worshipped and praisedGod, and returned with confidence to his three hundred men. Wherever weare, we may speak to God, and worship him. God must have the praise ofthat which encourages our faith. And his providence must beacknowledged in events, though small and seemingly accidental.
Jdg 7:16-22	<br>This method of defeating the Midianites may be alluded to, asexemplifying the destruction of the devil's kingdom in the world, bythe preaching of the everlasting gospel, the sounding that trumpet, andthe holding forth that light out of earthen vessels, for such are theministers of the gospel, 2Co 4:6,7. God chose the foolish things ofthe world to confound the wise, a barley-cake to overthrow the tents ofMidian, that the excellency of the power might be of God only. Thegospel is a sword, not in the hand, but in the mouth: the sword of theLord and of Gideon; of God and Jesus Christ, of Him that sits on thethrone and the Lamb. The wicked are often led to avenge the cause ofGod upon each other, under the power of their delusions, and the furyof their passions. See also how God often makes the enemies of thechurch instruments to destroy one another; it is a pity that thechurch's friends should ever act like them.
Jdg 7:23-25	<br>Two chief commanders of the host of Midian were taken and slain by themen of Ephraim. It were to be wished that we all did as these did, andthat where help is needed, that it were willingly and readily performedby another. And that if there were any excellent and profitable matterbegun, we were willing to have fellow-labourers to the finishing andperfecting the same, and not, as often, hinder one another.
Jdg 8:1-3	<br>Those who will not attempt or venture any thing in the cause of God,will be the most ready to censure and quarrel with such as are of amore zealous and enterprising spirit. And those who are the mostbackward to difficult services, will be the most angry not to have thecredit of them. Gideon stands here as a great example of self-denial;and shows us that envy is best removed by humility. The Ephraimites hadgiven vent to their passion in very wrong freedom of speech, a certainsign of a weak cause: reason runs low when chiding flies high.
Jdg 8:4-12	<br>Gideon's men were faint, yet pursuing; fatigued with what they haddone, yet eager to do more against their enemies. It is many a time thetrue Christian's case, fainting, and yet pursuing. The world knows butlittle of the persevering and successful struggle the real believermaintains with his sinful heart. But he betakes himself to that Divinestrength, in the faith of which he began his conflict, and by thesupply of which alone he can finish it in triumph.
Jdg 8:13-17	<br>The active servants of the Lord meet with more dangerous oppositionfrom false professors than from open enemies; but they must not carefor the behaviour of those who are Israelites in name, but Midianitesin heart. They must pursue the enemies of their souls, and of the causeof God, though they are ready to faint through inward conflicts andoutward hardships. And they shall be enabled to persevere. The less menhelp, and the more they seek to hinder, the more will the Lord assist.Gideon's warning being slighted, the punishment was just. Many aretaught with the briers and thorns of affliction, who would not learnotherwise.
Jdg 8:18-21	<br>The kings of Midian must be reckoned with. As they confessed themselvesguilty of murder, Gideon acted as the avenger of blood, being the nextof kin to the persons slain. Little did they think to have heard ofthis so long after; but murder seldom goes unpunished in this life.Sins long forgotten by man, must be accounted for to God. What poorconsolation in death from the hope of suffering less pain, and of dyingwith less disgrace than some others! yet many are more anxious on theseaccounts, than concerning the future judgment, and what will follow.
Jdg 8:22-28	<br>Gideon refused the government the people offered him. No good man canbe pleased with any honour done to himself, which belongs only to God.Gideon thought to keep up the remembrance of this victory by an ephod,made of the choicest of the spoils. But probably this ephod had, asusual, a teraphim annexed to it, and Gideon intended this for an oracleto be consulted. Many are led into false ways by one false step of agood man. It became a snare to Gideon himself, and it proved the ruinof the family. How soon will ornaments which feed the lust of the eye,and form the pride of life, as well as tend to the indulgences of theflesh, bring shame on those who are fond of them!
Jdg 8:29-35	<br>As soon as Gideon was dead, who kept the people to the worship of theGod of Israel, they found themselves under no restraint; then they wentafter Baalim, and showed no kindness to the family of Gideon. No wonderif those who forget their God, forget their friends. Yet conscious ofour own ingratitude to the Lord, and observing that of mankind ingeneral, we should learn to be patient under any unkind returns we meetwith for our poor services, and resolve, after the Divine example, notto be overcome of evil, but to overcome evil with good.
Jdg 9:1-6	<br>The men of Shechem chose Abimelech king. God was not consulted whetherthey should have any king, much less who it should be. If parents couldsee what their children would do, and what they are to suffer, theirjoy in them often would be turned into sorrow: we may be thankful thatwe cannot know what shall happen. Above all, we should fear and watchagainst sin; for our evil conduct may produce fatal effects upon ourfamilies, after we are in our graves.
Jdg 9:7-21	<br>There was no occasion for the trees to choose a king, they are all thetrees of the Lord which he has planted. Nor was there any occasion forIsrael to set a king over them, for the Lord was their King. Those whobear fruit for the public good, are justly respected and honoured byall that are wise, more than those who merely make a figure. All thesefruit-trees gave much the same reason for their refusal to be promotedover the trees; or, as the margin reads it, to go up and down for thetrees. To rule, involves a man in a great deal both of toil and care.Those who are preferred to public trust and power, must forego allprivate interests and advantages, for the good of others. And thoseadvanced to honour and dignity, are in great danger of losing theirfruitfulness. For which reason, they that desire to do good, are afraidof being too great. Jotham compares Abimelech to the bramble orthistle, a worthless plant, whose end is to be burned. Such a one wasAbimelech.
Jdg 9:22-29	<br>Abimelech is seated in the throne his father refused. But how long doesthis glory last? Stay but three years, and see the bramble withered andburned. The prosperity of the wicked is short and fickle. TheShechemites are plagued by no other hand than Abimelech's. They raisedhim unjustly to the throne; they first feel the weight of his sceptre.
Jdg 9:30-49	<br>Abimelech intended to punish the Schechemites for slighting him now,but God punished them for their serving him formerly in the murder ofGideon's sons. When God uses men as instruments in his hand to do hiswork, he means one thing, and they another. That, which they hopedwould have been for their welfare, proved a snare and a trap, as thosewill certainly find, who run to idols for shelter; such will prove arefuge of lies. (Jdg 9:50-57)
Jdg 9:50-57	<br>The Shechemites were ruined by Abimelech; now he is reckoned with, whowas their leader in villany. Evil pursues sinners, and sometimesovertakes them, when not only at ease, but triumphant. Thoughwickedness may prosper a while, it will not prosper always. The historyof mankind, if truly told, would greatly resemble that of this chapter.The records of what are called splendid events present to us suchcontests for power. Such scenes, though praised of men, fully explainthe Scripture doctrine of the deceitfulness and desperate wickedness ofthe human heart, the force of men's lust, and the effect of Satan'sinfluence. Lord, thou has given us thy word of truth and righteousness,O pour upon us thy spirit of purity, peace, and love, and write thyholy law in our hearts.
Jdg 10:1-5	<br>Quiet and peaceable reigns, though the best to live in, yield leastvariety of matter to be spoken of. Such were the days of Tola and Jair.They were humble, active, and useful men, rulers appointed of God.
Jdg 10:6-9	<br>Now the threatening was fulfilled, that the Israelites should have nopower to stand before their enemies, Le 26:17,37. By their evil waysand their evil doings they procured this to themselves.
Jdg 10:10-18	<br>God is able to multiply men's punishments according to the numbers oftheir sins and idols. But there is hope when sinners cry to the Lordfor help, and lament their ungodliness as well as their more opentransgressions. It is necessary, in true repentance, that there be afull conviction that those things cannot help us which we have set incompetition with God. They acknowledged what they deserved, yet prayedto God not to deal with them according to their deserts. We must submitto God's justice, with a hope in his mercy. True repentance is not onlyfor sin, but from sin. As the disobedience and misery of a child are agrief to a tender father, so the provocations of God's people are agrief to him. From him mercy never can be sought in vain. Let then thetrembling sinner, and the almost despairing backslider, cease fromdebating about God's secret purposes, or from expecting to find hopefrom former experiences. Let them cast themselves on the mercy of Godour Saviour, humble themselves under his hand, seek deliverance fromthe powers of darkness, separate themselves from sin, and fromoccasions of it, use the means of grace diligently, and wait the Lord'stime, and so they shall certainly rejoice in his mercy.
Jdg 11:1-11	<br>Men ought not to be blamed for their parentage, so long as they bytheir personal merits roll away any reproach. God had forgiven Israel,therefore Jephthah will forgive. He speaks not with confidence of hissuccess, knowing how justly God might suffer the Ammonites to prevailfor the further punishment of Israel. Nor does he speak with anyconfidence at all in himself. If he succeed, it is the Lord deliversthem into his hand; he thereby reminds his countrymen to look up to Godas the Giver of victory. The same question as here, in fact, is put tothose who desire salvation by Christ. If he save you, will ye bewilling that he shall rule you? On no other terms will he save you. Ifhe make you happy, shall he make you holy? If he be your helper, shallhe be your Head? Jephthah, to obtain a little worldly honour, waswilling to expose his life: shall we be discouraged in our Christianwarfare by the difficulties we may meet with, when Christ has promiseda crown of life to him that overcometh?
Jdg 11:12-28	<br>One instance of the honour and respect we owe to God, as our God, is,rightly to employ what he gives us to possess. Receive it from him, useit for him, and part with it when he calls for it. The whole of thismessage shows that Jephthah was well acquainted with the books ofMoses. His argument was clear, and his demand reasonable. Those whopossess the most courageous faith, will be the most disposed for peace,and the readiest to make advances to obtain; but rapacity and ambitionoften cloak their designs under a plea of equity, and render peacefulendeavours of no avail.
Jdg 11:29-40	<br>Several important lessons are to be learned from Jephthah's vow. 1.There may be remainders of distrust and doubting, even in the hearts oftrue and great believers. 2. Our vows to God should not be as apurchase of the favour we desire, but to express gratitude to him. 3.We need to be very well-advised in making vows, lest we entangleourselves. 4. What we have solemnly vowed to God, we must perform, ifit be possible and lawful, though it be difficult and grievous to us.5. It well becomes children, obediently and cheerfully to submit totheir parents in the Lord. It is hard to say what Jephthah did inperformance of his vow; but it is thought that he did not offer hisdaughter as a burnt-offering. Such a sacrifice would have been anabomination to the Lord; it is supposed she was obliged to remainunmarried, and apart from her family. Concerning this and some othersuch passages in the sacred history, about which learned men aredivided and in doubt, we need not perplex ourselves; what is necessaryto our salvation, thanks be to God, is plain enough. If the readerrecollects the promise of Christ concerning the teaching of the HolySpirit, and places himself under this heavenly Teacher, the Holy Ghostwill guide to all truth in every passage, so far as it is needful to beunderstood.
Jdg 12:1-7	<br>The Ephraimites had the same quarrel with Jephthah as with Gideon.Pride was at the bottom of the quarrel; only by that comes contention.It is ill to fasten names of reproach upon persons or countries, as iscommon, especially upon those under outward disadvantages. It oftenoccasions quarrels that prove of ill consequence, as it did here. Nocontentions are so bitter as those between brethren or rivals forhonour. What need we have to watch and pray against evil tempers! Maythe Lord incline all his people to follow after things which make forpeace!
Jdg 12:8-15	<br>We have here a short account of three more of the judges of Israel. Thehappiest life of individuals, and the happiest state of society, isthat which affords the fewest remarkable events. To live in credit andquiet, to be peacefully useful to those around us, to possess a clearconscience; but, above all, and without which nothing can avail, toenjoy communion with God our Saviour while we live, and to die at peacewith God and man, form the substance of all that a wise man can desire.
Jdg 13:1-7	<br>Israel did evil: then God delivered them again into the hands of thePhilistines. When Israel was in this distress, Samson was born. Hisparents had been long childless. Many eminent persons were born of suchmothers. Mercies long waited for, often prove signal mercies; and bythem others may be encouraged to continue their hope in God's mercy.The angel notices her affliction. God often sends comfort to his peoplevery seasonably, when they feel their troubles most. This deliverer ofIsrael must be devoted to God. Manoah's wife was satisfied that themessenger was of God. She gave her husband a particular account, bothof the promise and of the precept. Husbands and wives should tell eachother their experiences of communion with God, and their improvementsin acquaintance with him, that they may help each other in the way thatis holy.
Jdg 13:8-14	<br>Blessed are those who have not seen, and yet, as Manoah, have believed.Good men are more careful and desirous to know the duty to be done bythem, than to know the events concerning them: duty is ours, events areGod's. God will guide those by his counsel, who desire to know theirduty, and apply to him to teach them. Pious parents, especially, willbeg Divine assistance. The angel repeats the directions he had beforegiven. There is need of much care for the right ordering both ofourselves and our children, that we may be duly separate from theworld, and living sacrifices to the Lord.
Jdg 13:15-23	<br>What Manoah asked for instruction in his duty, he was readily told; butwhat he asked to gratify his curiosity, was denied. God has in his wordgiven full directions concerning our duty, but never designed to answerother questionings. There are secret things which belong not to us, ofwhich we must be quite contented to be ignorant, while in this world.The name of our Lord is wonderful and secret; but by his wonderfulworks he makes himself known as far as is needful for us. Prayer is theascent of the soul to God. But without Christ in the heart by faith,our services are offensive smoke; in him, acceptable flame. We mayapply this to Christ's sacrifice of himself for us; he ascended in theflame of his own offering, for by his own blood he entered in once intothe holy place, Heb 9:12. In Manoah's reflections there is great fear;We shall surely die. In his wife's reflection there is great faith. Asa help meet for him, she encouraged him. Let believers who have hadcommunion with God in the word and prayer, to whom he has graciouslymanifested himself, and who have had reason to think God has acceptedtheir works, take encouragement from thence in a cloudy and dark day.God would not have done what he has done for my soul, if he haddesigned to forsake me, and leave me to perish at last; for his work isperfect. Learn to reason as Manoah's wife; If God designed me to perishunder his wrath, he would not give me tokens of his favour.
Jdg 13:24,25	<br>The Spirit of the Lord began to move Samson when a youth. This wasevidence that the Lord blessed him. Where God gives his blessing, hegives his Spirit to qualify for the blessing. Those are blessed indeedin whom the Spirit of grace begins to work in the days of theirchildhood. Samson drank no wine or strong drink, yet excelled instrength and courage, for he had the Spirit of God moving him;therefore be not drunk with wine, but be filled with the Spirit.
Jdg 14:1-4	<br>As far as Samson's marriage was a common case, it was weak and foolishof him to set his affections upon a daughter of the Philistines. Shallone, not only an Israelite, but a Nazarite, devoted to the Lord, covetto become one with a worshipper of Dagon? It does not appear that hehad any reason to think her wise or virtuous, or any way likely to be ahelp meet for him; but he saw something in her agreeable to his fancy.He that, in the choice of a wife, is only guided by his eye, andgoverned by his fancy, must afterwards thank himself if he find aPhilistine in his arms. Yet it was well done not to proceed till Samsonhad made his parents acquainted with the matter. Children ought not tomarry, nor to move towards it, without the advice and consent of theirparents. Samson's parents did well to dissuade him from yoking himselfunequally with unbelievers. It seems that it pleased God to leaveSamson to follow his own inclinations, intending to bring out good fromhis conduct; and his parents consented, because he was bent upon it.However, his example is not recorded for us to do likewise.
Jdg 14:5-9	<br>By enabling him to kill a lion, God let Samson know what he could do inthe strength of the Spirit of the Lord, that he might never be afraidto look the greatest difficulties in the face. He was alone in thevineyards, whither he had rambled. Young people consider not how theyexposed themselves to the roaring lion that seeks to devour, when theywander from their prudent, pious parents. Nor do men consider whatlions lurk in the vineyards, the vineyards of red wines. Our Lord Jesushaving conquered Satan, that roaring lion, believers, like Samson, findhoney in the carcass abundant strength and satisfaction, enough forthemselves, and for all their friends.
Jdg 14:10-20	<br>Samson's riddle literally meant no more than that he had got honey, forfood and for pleasure, from the lion, which in its strength and furywas ready to devour him. But the victory of Christ over Satan, by meansof his humiliation, agonies, and death, and the exaltation thatfollowed to him, with the glory thence to the Father, and spiritualadvantages to his people, seem directly alluded to. And even death,that devouring monster, being robbed of his sting, and stripped of hishorror, forwards the soul to the realms of bliss. In these and othersenses, out of the eater comes forth meat, and out of the strong,sweetness. Samson's companions obliged his wife to get the explanationfrom him. A worldly wife, or a worldly friend, is to a godly man as anenemy in the camp, who will watch every opportunity to betray him. Nounion can be comfortable or lasting, where secrets cannot be intrusted,without danger of being divulged. Satan, in his temptations, could notdo us the mischief he does, if he did not plough with the heifer of ourcorrupt nature. His chief advantage against us arises from hiscorrespondence with our deceitful hearts and inbred lusts. This provedan occasion of weaning Samson from his new relations. It were well forus, if the unkindness we meet with from the world, and ourdisappointments in it, obliged us by faith and prayer to return to ourheavenly Father's house, and to rest there. See how little confidenceis to be put in man. Whatever pretence of friendship may be made, areal Philistine will soon be weary of a true Israelite.
Jdg 15:1-8	<br>When there are differences between relations, let those be reckoned thewisest and best, who are most forward to forgive or forget, and mostwilling to stoop and yield for the sake of peace. In the means whichSamson employed, we must look at the power of God supplying them, andmaking them successful, to mortify the pride and punish the wickednessof the Philistines. The Philistines threatened Samson's wife that theywould burn her and her father's house. She, to save herself and obligeher countrymen, betrayed her husband; and the very thing that shefeared, and by sin sought to avoid, came upon her! She, and herfather's house, were burnt with fire, and by her countrymen, whom shethought to oblige by the wrong she did to her husband. The mischief weseek to escape by any unlawful practices, we often pull down upon ourown heads.
Jdg 15:9-17	<br>Sin dispirits men, it hides from their eyes the things that belong totheir peace. The Israelites blamed Samson for what he had done againstthe Philistines, as if he had done them a great injury. Thus our LordJesus did many good works, and for those the Jews were ready to stonehim. When the Spirit of the Lord came upon Samson, his cords wereloosed: where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty, and thoseare free indeed who are thus set free. Thus Christ triumphed over thepowers of darkness that shouted against him, as if they had him intheir power. Samson made great destruction among the Philistines. Totake the bone of an ass for this, was to do wonders by the foolishthings of the world, that the excellency of the power might be of God,not of man. This victory was not in the weapon, was not in the arm; butit was in the Spirit of God, which moved the weapon by the arm. We cando all things through Him that strengtheneth us. Seest thou a poorChristian, who is enabled to overcome a temptation by weak, feeblecounsel, there is the Philistine vanquished by a sorry jaw-bone.
Jdg 15:18-20	<br>So little notice did the men of Judah take of their deliverer, that hewas ready to perish for want of a draught of water. Thus are thegreatest slights often put upon those who do the greatest services.Samson prayed to God in this distress. Those that forget to attend Godtheir praises, may be compelled to attend him with their prayers. Pastexperiences of God's power and goodness, are excellent pleas in prayerfor further mercy. He pleads his being exposed to God's enemies; ourbest pleas are taken from God's glory. The Lord sent him seasonablerelief. The place of this action was, from the jaw-bone, called Lehi.And in the place thus called, God caused a fountain suddenly andseasonably to open, close by Samson. We should be more thankful for themercy of water, did we consider how ill we can spare it. Israelsubmitted to him whom they had betrayed. God was with him; henceforwardthey were directed by him as their judge.
Jdg 16:1-3	<br>Hitherto Samson's character has appeared glorious, though uncommon. Inthis chapter we find him behaving in so wicked a manner, that manyquestion whether or not he were a godly man. But the apostle hasdetermined this, Heb 11:32. By adverting to the doctrines and examplesof Scripture, the artifices of Satan, the deceitfulness of the humanheart, and the methods in which the Lord frequently deals with hispeople, we may learn useful lessons from this history, at which someneedlessly stumble, while others cavil and object. The peculiar time inwhich Samson lived may account for many things, which, if done in ourtime, and without the special appointment of Heaven, would be highlycriminal. And there might have been in him many exercises of piety,which, if recorded, would have reflected a different light upon hischaracter. Observe Samson's danger. Oh that all who indulge theirsensual appetites in drunkenness, or any fleshly lusts, would seethemselves thus surrounded, way-laid, and marked for ruin by theirspiritual enemies! The faster they sleep, the more secure they feel,the greater their danger. We hope it was with a pious resolution not toreturn to his sin, that he rose under a fear of the danger he was in.Can I be safe under this guilt? It was bad that he lay down withoutsuch checks; but it would have been worse, if he had laid still underthem.
Jdg 16:4-17	<br>Samson had been more than once brought into mischief and danger by thelove of women, yet he would not take warning, but is again taken in thesame snare, and this third time is fatal. Licentiousness is one of thethings that take away the heart. This is a deep pit into which manyhave fallen; but from which few have escaped, and those by a miracle ofmercy, with the loss of reputation and usefulness, of almost all,except their souls. The anguish of the suffering is ten thousand timesgreater than all the pleasures of the sin.
Jdg 16:18-21	<br>See the fatal effects of false security. Satan ruins men by flatteringthem into a good opinion of their own safety, and so bringing them tomind nothing, and fear nothing; and then he robs them of their strengthand honour, and leads them captive at his will. When we sleep ourspiritual enemies do not. Samson's eyes were the inlets of his sin,(
Jdg 16:1),) and now his punishment began there. Now the Philistinesblinded him, he had time to remember how his own lust had beforeblinded him. The best way to preserve the eyes, is, to turn them awayfrom beholding vanity. Take warning by his fall, carefully to watchagainst all fleshly lusts; for all our glory is gone, and our defencedeparted from us, when our separation to God, as spiritual Nazarites,is profaned.	
Jdg 16:22-24	<br>Samson's afflictions were the means of bringing him to deep repentance.By the loss of his bodily sight the eyes of his understanding wereopened; and by depriving him of bodily strength, the Lord was pleasedto renew his spiritual strength. The Lord permits some few to wanderwide and sink deep, yet he recovers them at last, and marking hisdispleasure at sin in their severe temporal sufferings, preserves themfrom sinking into the pit of destruction. Hypocrites may abuse theseexamples, and infidels mock at them, but true Christians will therebybe rendered more humble, watchful, and circumspect; more simple intheir dependence on the Lord, more fervent in prayer to be kept fromfalling, and in praise for being preserved; and, if they fall, theywill be kept from sinking into despair.
Jdg 16:25-31	<br>Nothing fills up the sins of any person or people faster than mockingand misusing the servants of God, even thought it is by their own follythat they are brought low. God put it into Samson's heart, as a publicperson, thus to avenge on them God's quarrel, Israel's, and his own.That strength which he had lost by sin, he recovers by prayer. That itwas not from passion or personal revenge, but from holy zeal for theglory of God and Israel, appears from God's accepting and answering theprayer. The house was pulled down, not by the natural strength ofSamson, but by the almighty power of God. In his case it was right heshould avenge the cause of God and Israel. Nor is he to be accused ofself-murder. He sought not his own death, but Israel's deliverance, andthe destruction of their enemies. Thus Samson died in bonds, and amongthe Philistines, as an awful rebuke for his sins; but he diedrepentant. The effects of his death typified those of the death ofChrist, who, of his own will, laid down his life among transgressors,and thus overturned the foundation of Satan's kingdom, and provided forthe deliverance of his people. Great as was the sin of Samson, andjustly as he deserved the judgments he brought upon himself, he foundmercy of the Lord at last; and every penitent shall obtain mercy, whoflees for refuge to that Saviour whose blood cleanses from all sin. Buthere is nothing to encourage any to indulge sin, from a hope they shallat last repent and be saved.
Jdg 17:1-6	<br>What is related in this, and the rest of the chapters to the end ofthis book, was done soon after the death of Joshua: see chap. Jud20:28. That it might appear how happy the nation was under the Judges,here is showed how unhappy they were when there was no Judge. The loveof money made Micah so undutiful to his mother as to rob her, and madeher so unkind to her son, as to curse him. Outward losses drive goodpeople to their prayers, but bad people to their curses. This woman'ssilver was her god, before it was made into a graven or a molten image.Micah and his mother agreed to turn their money into a god, and set upidol worship in their family. See the cause of this corruption. Everyman did that which was right in his own eyes, and then they soon didthat which was evil in the sight of the Lord.
Jdg 17:7-13	<br>Micah thought it was a sign of God's favour to him and his images, thata Levite should come to his door. Thus those who please themselves withtheir own delusions, if Providence unexpectedly bring any thing totheir hands that further them in their evil way, are apt from thence tothink that God is pleased with them.
Rth 1:1-5	<br>Elimelech's care to provide for his family, was not to be blamed; buthis removal into the country of Moab could not be justified. And theremoval ended in the wasting of his family. It is folly to think ofescaping that cross, which, being laid in our way, we ought to take up.Changing our place seldom is mending it. Those who bring young peopleinto bad acquaintance, and take them out of the way of publicordinances, thought they may think them well-principled, and armedagainst temptation, know not what will be the end. It does not appearthat the women the sons of Elimelech married, were proselyted to theJewish religion. Earthly trials or enjoyments are of short continuance.Death continually removes those of every age and situation, and marsall our outward comforts: we cannot too strongly prefer thoseadvantages which shall last for ever.
Rth 1:6-14	<br>Naomi began to think of returning, after the death of her two sons.When death comes into a family, it ought to reform what is amiss there.Earth is made bitter to us, that heaven may be made dear. Naomi seemsto have been a person of faith and piety. She dismissed herdaughters-in-law with prayer. It is very proper for friends, when theypart, to part with them thus part in love. Did Naomi do well, todiscourage her daughters from going with her, when she might save themfrom the idolatry of Moab, and bring them to the faith and worship ofthe God of Israel? Naomi, no doubt, desired to do that; but if theywent with her, she would not have them to go upon her account. Thosethat take upon them a profession of religion only to oblige theirfriends, or for the sake of company, will be converts of small value.If they did come with her, she would have them make it their deliberatechoice, and sit down first and count the cost, as it concerns those todo who make a profession of religion. And more desire "rest in thehouse of a husband," or some wordly settlement or earthly satisfaction,than the rest to which Christ invites our souls; therefore when triedthey will depart from Christ, though perhaps with some sorrow.
Rth 1:15-18	<br>See Ruth's resolution, and her good affection to Naomi. Orpah was lothto part from her; yet she did not love her well enough to leave Moabfor her sake. Thus, many have a value and affection for Christ, yetcome short of salvation by him, because they will not forsake otherthings for him. They love him, yet leave him, because they do not lovehim enough, but love other things better. Ruth is an example of thegrace of God, inclining the soul to choose the better part. Naomi coulddesire no more than the solemn declaration Ruth made. See the power ofresolution; it silences temptation. Those that go in religious wayswithout a stedfast mind, stand like a door half open, which invites athief; but resolution shuts and bolts the door, resists the devil andforces him to flee.
Rth 1:19-22	<br>Naomi and Ruth came to Bethlehem. Afflictions will make great andsurprising changes in a little time. May God, by his grace, fit us forall such changes, especially the great change!, Naomi signifies"pleasant," or "amiable;" Mara, "bitter," or "bitterness." She was nowa woman of a sorrowful spirit. She had come home empty, poor, a widowand childless. But there is a fulness for believers of which they nevercan be emptied; a good part which shall not be taken from those whohave it. The cup of affliction is a "bitter" cup, but she owns that theaffliction came from God. It well becomes us to have our hearts humbledunder humbling providences. It is not affliction itself, but afflictionrightly borne, that does us good.
Rth 2:1-3	<br>Observe Ruth's humility. When Providence had made her poor, shecheerfully stoops to her lot. High spirits will rather starve thanstoop; not so Ruth. Nay, it is her own proposal. She speaks humbly inher expectation of leave to glean. We may not demand kindness as adebt, but ask, and take it as a favour, though in a small matter. Ruthalso was an example of industry. She loved not to eat the bread ofidleness. This is an example to young people. Diligence promises well,both for this world and the other. We must not be shy of any honestemployment. No labour is a reproach. Sin is a thing below us, but wemust not think any thing else so, to which Providence call us. She wasan example of regard to her mother, and of trust in Providence. Godwisely orders what seem to us small events; and those that appearaltogether uncertain, still are directed to serve his own glory, andthe good of his people.
Rth 2:4-16	<br>The pious and kind language between Boaz and his reapers shows thatthere were godly persons in Israel. Such language as this is seldomheard in our field; too often, on the contrary, what is immoral andcorrupt. A stranger would form a very different opinion of our land,from that which Ruth would form of Israel from the converse and conductof Boaz and his reapers. But true religion will teach a man to behavearight in all states and conditions; it will form kind masters andfaithful servants, and cause harmony in families. True religion willcause mutual love and kindness among persons of different ranks. It hadthese effects on Boaz and his men. When he came to them he prayed forthem. They did not, as soon as he was out of hearing curse him, as someill-natured servants that hate their master's eye, but they returnedhis courtesy. Things are likely to go on well where there is suchgood-will as this between masters and servants. They expressed theirkindness to each other by praying one for another. Boaz inquiredconcerning the stranger he saw, and ordered her to be well treated.Masters must take care, not only that they do no hurt themselves, butthat they suffer not their servants and those under them to do wrong.Ruth humbly owned herself unworthy of favours, seeing she was born andbrought up a heathen. It well becomes us all to think humbly ofourselves, esteeming others better than ourselves. And let us, in thekindness of Boaz to Ruth, note the kindness of the Lord Jesus Christ topoor sinners.
Rth 2:17-23	<br>It encourages industry, that in all labour, even that of gleaning,there is profit. Ruth was pleased with what she gained by her ownindustry, and was careful to secure it. Let us thus take care that welose not those things which we have wrought, which we have gained forour souls' good, 2Jo 1:8. Parents should examine their children, asNaomi did, not to frighten or discourage them, so as to make them hatehome, or tempt them to tell a lie; but to commend them if they havedone well, and with mildness to reprove and caution them if they havedone otherwise. It is a good question for us to ask ourselves everynight, Where have I gleaned to-day? What improvement have I made inknowledge and grace? What have I done that will turn to a good account?When the Lord deals bountifully with us, let us not be found in anyother field, nor seeking for happiness and satisfaction in thecreature. We lose Divine favours, if we slight them. Ruth dutifullyobserved her mother's directions. And when the harvest was ended, shekept her aged mother company at home. Dinah went out to see thedaughters of the land; her vanity ended in disgrace, Ge 34. Ruth keptat home, and helped to maintain her mother, and went out on no othererrand than to get provision for her; her humility and industry endedin preferment.
Rth 3:1-5	<br>The married state should be a rest, as much as any thing upon earth canbe so, as it ought to fix the affections and form a connexion for life.Therefore it should be engaged in with great seriousness, with earnestprayers for direction, for the blessing of God, and with regard to hisprecepts. Parents should carefully advise their children in thisimportant concern, that it may be well with them as to their souls. Beit always remembered, That is best for us which is best for our souls.The course Naomi advised appears strange to us; but it was according tothe laws and usages of Israel. If the proposed measure had borne theappearance of evil, Naomi would not have advised it. Law and customgave Ruth, who was now proselyted to the true religion, a legal claimupon Boaz. It was customary for widows to assert this claim, De25:5-10. But this is not recorded for imitation in other times, and isnot to be judged by modern rules. And if there had been any evil in it,Ruth was a woman of too much virtue and too much sense to have listenedto it.
Rth 3:6-13	<br>What in one age or nation would be improper, is not always so inanother age or another nation. Being a judge of Israel, Boaz would tellRuth what she should do; also whether he had the right of redemption,and what methods must be taken, and what rites used, in order toaccomplishing her marriage with him or another person. The conduct ofBoaz calls for the highest praise. He attempted not to take advantageof Ruth; he did not disdain her as a poor, destitute stranger, norsuspect her of any ill intentions. He spoke honourably of her as avirtuous woman, made her a promise, and as soon as the morning arrived,sent her away with a present to her mother-in-law. Boaz made hispromise conditional, for there was a kinsman nearer than he, to whomthe right of redemption belonged.
Rth 3:14-18	<br>Ruth had done all that was fit for her to do, she must patiently waitthe event. Boaz, having undertaken this matter, would be sure to manageit well. Much more reason have true believers to cast their care onGod, because he has promised to care for them. Our strength is to sitstill, Isa 30:7. This narrative may encourage us to lay ourselves byfaith at the feet of Christ: He is our near Kinsman; having taken ournature upon him. He has the right to redeem. Let us seek to receivefrom him his directions: Lord, what wilt thou have me to do? Ac 9:6. Hewill never blame us as doing this unseasonably. And let us earnestlydesire and seek the same rest for our children and friends, that it maybe well with them also.
Rth 4:1-8	<br>This matter depended on the laws given by Moses about inheritances, anddoubtless the whole was settled in the regular and legal manner. Thiskinsman, when he heard the conditions of the bargain, refused it. Inlike manner many are shy of the great redemption; they are not willingto espouse religion; they have heard well of it, and have nothing tosay against it; they will give it their good word, but they are willingto part with it, and cannot be bound to it, for fear of marring theirown inheritance in this world. The right was resigned to Boaz. Fair andopen dealing in all matters of contract and trade, is what all mustmake conscience of, who would approve themselves true Israelites,without guile. Honesty will be found the best policy.
Rth 4:9-12	<br>Men are ready to seize opportunities for increasing their estates, butfew know the value of godliness. Such are the wise men of this world,whom the Lord charges with folly. They attend not to the concerns oftheir souls, but reject the salvation of Christ, for fear of marringtheir inheritance. But God did Boaz the honour to bring him into theline of the Messiah, while the kinsman, who was afraid of lesseninghimself, and marring his inheritance, has his name, family, andinheritance forgotten.
Rth 4:13-22	<br>Ruth bore a son, through whom thousands and myriads were born to God;and in being the lineal ancestor of Christ, she was instrumental in thehappiness of all that shall be saved by him; even of us Gentiles, aswell as those of Jewish descent. She was a witness for God to theGentile world, that he had not utterly forsaken them, but that in duetime they should become one with his chosen people, and partake of hissalvation. Prayer to God attended the marriage, and praise to himattended the birth of the child. What a pity it is that pious languageshould not be more used among Christians, or that it should be let fallinto formality! Here is the descent of David from Ruth. And the periodcame when Bethlehem-Judah displayed greater wonders than those in thehistory of Ruth, when the outcast babe of another forlorn female of thesame race appeared, controlling the counsels of the Roman master of theworld, and drawing princes and wise men from the east, with treasuresof gold, and frankincense, and myrrh to his feet. His name shall endurefor ever, and all nations shall call Him blessed. In that Seed shallall the nations of the earth be blessed.
1Sa 1:1-8	<br>Elkanah kept up his attendance at God's altar, notwithstanding theunhappy differences in his family. If the devotions of a family prevailnot to put an end to its divisions, yet let not the divisions put astop to the devotions. To abate our just love to any relation for thesake of any infirmity which they cannot help, and which is theiraffliction, is to make God's providence quarrel with his precept, andvery unkindly to add affliction to the afflicted. It is evidence of abase disposition, to delight in grieving those who are of a sorrowfulspirit, and in putting those out of humour who are apt to fret and beuneasy. We ought to bear one another's burdens, not add to them. Hannahcould not bear the provocation. Those who are of a fretful spirit, andare apt to lay provocations too much to heart, are enemies tothemselves, and strip themselves of many comforts both of life andgodliness. We ought to notice comforts, to keep us from grieving forcrosses. We should look at that which is for us, as well as what isagainst us.
1Sa 1:9-18	<br>Hannah mingled tears with her prayers; she considered the mercy of ourGod, who knows the troubled soul. God gives us leave, in prayer, notonly to ask good things in general, but to mention that special goodthing we most need and desire. She spoke softly, none could hear her.Hereby she testified her belief of God's knowledge of the heart and itsdesires. Eli was high priest, and judge in Israel. It ill becomes us tobe rash and hasty in censures of others, and to think people guilty ofbad things while the matter is doubtful and unproved. Hannah did notretort the charge, and upbraid Eli with the wicked conduct of his ownsons. When we are at any time unjustly censured, we have need to set adouble watch before the door of our lips, that we do not return censurefor censure. Hannah thought it enough to clear herself, and so must we.Eli was willing to acknowledge his mistake. Hannah went away withsatisfaction of mind. She had herself by prayer committed her case toGod, and Eli had prayed for her. Prayer is heart's ease to a gracioussoul. Prayer will smooth the countenance; it should do so. None willlong remain miserable, who use aright the privilege of going to themercy-seat of a reconciled God in Christ Jesus.
1Sa 1:19-28	<br>Elkanah and his family had a journey before them, and a family ofchildren to take with them, yet they would not move till they hadworshipped God together. Prayer and provender do not hinder a journey.When men are in such haste to set out upon journeys, or to engage inbusiness, that they have not time to worship God, they are likely toproceed without his presence and blessing. Hannah, though she felt awarm regard for the courts of God's house, begged to stay at home. Godwill have mercy, and not sacrifice. Those who are detained from publicordinances, by the nursing and tending of little children, may takecomfort from this instance, and believe, that if they do that duty in aright spirit, God will graciously accept them therein. Hannah presentedher child to the Lord with a grateful acknowledgment of his goodness inanswer to prayer. Whatever we give to God, it is what we have firstasked and received from him. All our gifts to him were first his giftsto us. The child Samuel early showed true piety. Little children shouldbe taught to worship God when very young. Their parents should teachthem in it, bring them to it, and put them on doing it as well as theycan; God will graciously accept them, and will teach them to do better.
1Sa 2:1-10	<br>Hannah's heart rejoiced, not in Samuel, but in the Lord. She looksbeyond the gift, and praises the Giver. She rejoiced in the salvationof the Lord, and in expectation of His coming, who is the wholesalvation of his people. The strong are soon weakened, and the weak aresoon strengthened, when God pleases. Are we poor? God made us poor,which is a good reason why we should be content, and make up our mindsto our condition. Are we rich? God made us rich, which is a good reasonwhy we should be thankful, and serve him cheerfully, and do good withthe abundance he gives us. He respects not man's wisdom or fanciedexcellences, but chooses those whom the world accounts foolish,teaching them to feel their guilt, and to value his free and precioussalvation. This prophecy looks to the kingdom of Christ, that kingdomof grace, of which Hannah speaks, after having spoken largely of thekingdom of providence. And here is the first time that we meet with thename MESSIAH, or his Anointed. The subjects of Christ's kingdom will besafe, and the enemies of it will be ruined; for the Anointed, the LordChrist, is able to save, and to destroy.
1Sa 2:11-26	<br>Samuel, being devoted to the Lord in a special manner, was from a childemployed about the sanctuary in the services he was capable of. As hedid this with a pious disposition of mind, it was called ministeringunto the Lord. He received a blessing from the Lord. Those young peoplewho serve God as well as they can, he will enable to improve, that theymay serve him better. Eli shunned trouble and exertion. This led him toindulge his children, without using parental authority to restrain andcorrect them when young. He winked at the abuses in the service of thesanctuary till they became customs, and led to abominations; and hissons, who should have taught those that engaged in the service of thesanctuary what was good, solicited them to wickedness. Their offencewas committed even in offering the sacrifices for sins, which typifiedthe atonement of the Saviour! Sins against the remedy, the atonementitself, are most dangerous, they tread under foot the blood of thecovenant. Eli's reproof was far too mild and gentle. In general, noneare more abandoned than the degenerate children of godly persons, whenthey break through restraints.
1Sa 2:27-36	<br>Those who allow their children in any evil way, and do not use theirauthority to restrain and punish them, in effect honour them more thanGod. Let Eli's example excite parents earnestly to strive against thebeginnings of wickedness, and to train up their children in the nurtureand admonition of the Lord. In the midst of the sentence against thehouse of Eli, mercy is promised to Israel. God's work shall never fallto the ground for want of hands to carry it on. Christ is that mercifuland faithful High Priest, whom God raised up when the Leviticalpriesthood was thrown off, who in all things did his Father's mind, andfor whom God will build a sure house, build it on a rock, so that hellcannot prevail against it.
1Sa 3:1-10	<br>The call which Divine grace designs shall be made effectual; will berepeated till it is so, till we come to the call. Eli, perceiving thatit was the voice of God that Samuel heard, instructed him what to say.Though it was a disgrace to Eli, for God's call to be directed toSamuel, yet he told him how to meet it. Thus the elder should do theirutmost to assist and improve the younger that are rising up. Let usnever fail to teach those who are coming after us, even such as willsoon be preferred before us, Joh 1:30. Good words should be put intochildren's mouths betimes, by which they may be prepared to learnDivine things, and be trained up to regard them.
1Sa 3:11-18	<br>What a great deal of guilt and corruption is there in us, concerningwhich we may say, It is the iniquity which our own heart knoweth; weare conscious to ourselves of it! Those who do not restrain the sins ofothers, when it is in their power to do it, make themselves partakersof the guilt, and will be charged as joining in it. In his remarkableanswer to this awful sentence, Eli acknowledged that the Lord had aright to do as he saw good, being assured that he would do nothingwrong. The meekness, patience, and humility contained in those words,show that he was truly repentant; he accepted the punishment of hissin.
1Sa 3:19-21	<br>All increase in wisdom and grace, is owing to the presence of God withus. God will graciously repeat his visits to those who receive themaright. Early piety will be the greatest honour of young people. Thosewho honour God he will honour. Let young people consider the piety ofSamuel, and from him they will learn to remember their Creator in thedays of their youth. Young children are capable of religion. Samuel isa proof that their waiting upon the Lord will be pleasing to him. He isa pattern of all those amiable tempers, which are the brightestornament of youth, and a sure source of happiness.
1Sa 4:1-9	<br>Israel is smitten before the Philistines. Sin, the accursed thing, wasin the camp, and gave their enemies all the advantage they could wishfor. They own the hand of God in their trouble; but, instead ofsubmitting, they speak angrily, as not aware of any just provocationthey had given him. The foolishness of man perverts his way, and thenhis heart frets against the Lord, Pr 19:3, and finds fault with him.They supposed that they could oblige God to appear for them, bybringing the ark into their camp. Those who have gone back in the lifeof religion, sometimes discover great fondness for the outwardobservances of it, as if those would save them; and as if the ark,God's throne, in the camp, would bring them to heaven, though the worldand the flesh are on the throne in the heart.
1Sa 4:10,11	<br>The taking of the ark was a great judgment upon Israel, and a certaintoken of God's displeasure. Let none think to shelter themselves fromthe wrath of God, under the cloak of outward profession.
1Sa 4:12-18	<br>The defeat of the army was very grievous to Eli as a judge; the tidingsof the death of his two sons, to whom he had been so indulgent, andwho, as he had reason to fear, died impenitent, touched him as afather; yet there was a greater concern on his spirit. And when themessenger concluded his story with, "The ark of God is taken," he isstruck to the heart, and died immediately. A man may die miserably, yetnot die eternally; may come to an untimely end, yet the end be peace.
1Sa 4:19-22	<br>The wife of Phinehas seems to have been a person of piety. Her dyingregret was for the loss of the ark, and the departure of the glory fromIsrael. What is any earthly joy to her that feels herself dying? No joybut that which is spiritual and divine, will stand in any stead then;death is too serious a thing to admit the relish of any earthly joy.What is it to one that is lamenting the loss of the ark? What pleasurecan we take in our creature comforts and enjoyments, if we want God'sword and ordinances; especially if we want the comfort of his graciouspresence, and the light of his countenance? If God go, the glory goes,and all good goes. Woe unto us if he depart! But though the glory iswithdrawn from one sinful nation, city, or village after another, yetit shall never depart altogether, but shines forth in one place wheneclipsed in another.
1Sa 5:1-5	<br>See the ark's triumph over Dagon. Thus the kingdom of Satan willcertainly fall before the kingdom of Christ, error before truth,profaneness before godliness, and corruption before grace in the heartsof the faithful. When the interests of religion seem to be ready tosink, even then we may be confident that the day of their triumph willcome. When Christ, the true Ark of the covenant, really enters theheart of fallen man, which is indeed Satan's temple, all idols willfall, every endeavour to set them up again will be vain, sin will beforsaken, and unrighteous gain restored; the Lord will claim andpossess the throne. But pride, self-love, and worldly lusts, thoughdethroned and crucified, still remain within us, like the stump ofDagon. Let us watch and pray that they may not prevail. Let us seek tohave them more entirely destroyed.
1Sa 5:6-12	<br>The hand of the Lord was heavy upon the Philistines; he not onlyconvinced them of their folly, but severely chastised their insolence.Yet they would not renounce Dagon; and instead of seeking God's mercy,they desired to get clear of his ark. Carnal hearts, when they smartunder the judgments of God, would rather, if it were possible, put himfar from them, than enter into covenant or communion with him, and seekhim for their friend. But their devices to escape the Divine judgmentsonly increase them. Those that fight against God will soon have enoughof it.
1Sa 6:1-9	<br>Seven months the Philistines were punished with the presence of theark; so long it was a plague to them, because they would not send ithome sooner. Sinners lengthen out their own miseries by refusing topart with their sins. The Israelites made no effort to recover the ark.Alas! where shall we find concern for religion prevail above all othermatters? In times of public calamity we fear for ourselves, for ourfamilies, and for our country; but who cares for the ark of God? We arefavoured with the gospel, but it is treated with neglect or contempt.We need not wonder if it should be taken from us; to many persons this,though the heavies of calamities, would occasion no grief. There aremultitudes whom any profession would please as well as that ofChristianity. But there are those who value the house, the word, andthe ministry of God above their richest possessions, who dread the lossof these blessings more than death. How willing bad men are to shiftoff their convictions, and when they are in trouble, to believe it is achance that happens; and that the rod has no voice which they shouldhear or heed!
1Sa 6:10-18	<br>These two kine knew their owner, their great Owner, whom Hophin andPhinehas knew not. God's providence takes notice even of brutecreatures, and serves its own purposes by them. When the reapers sawthe ark, they rejoiced; their joy for that was greater than the joy ofharvest. The return of the ark, and the revival of holy ordinances,after days of restraint and trouble, are matters of great joy.
1Sa 6:19-21	<br>It is a great affront to God, for vain men to pry into, and meddle withthe secret things which belong not to them, De 29:29; Col 2:18. Man wasruined by desiring forbidden knowledge. God will not suffer his ark tobe profaned. Be not deceived, God is not mocked. Those that will notfear his goodness, and reverently use the tokens of his grace, shall bemade to feel his justice. The number smitten is expressed in an unusualmanner in the original, and it is probable that it means 1170. Theydesire to be rid of the ark. Foolish men run from one extreme to theother. They should rather have asked, How may we have peace with God,and recover his favor? Mic 6:6,7. Thus, when the word of God workswith terror on sinners' consciences, they, instead of taking the blameand shame to themselves, quarrel with the word, and put that from them.Many stifle their convictions, and put salvation away from them.
1Sa 7:1-4	<br>God will find a resting-place for his ark; if some thrust it from them,the hearts of others shall be inclined to receive it. It is no newthing for God's ark to be in a private house. Christ and his apostlespreached from house to house, when they could not have public places.Twenty years passed before the house of Israel cared for the want ofthe ark. During this time the prophet Samuel laboured to revive truereligion. The few words used are very expressive; and this was one ofthe most effectual revivals of religion which ever took place inIsrael.
1Sa 7:5,6	<br>Israel drew water and poured it out before the Lord; signifying theirhumiliation and sorrow for sin. They pour out their hearts inrepentance before the Lord. They were free and full in theirconfession, and fixed in their resolution to cast away from them alltheir wrong doings. They made a public confession, We have sinnedagainst the Lord; thus giving glory to God, and taking shame tothemselves. And if we thus confess our sins, we shall find our Godfaithful and just to forgive us our sins.
1Sa 7:7-12	<br>The Philistines invaded Israel. When sinners begin to repent andreform, they must expect that Satan will muster all his force againstthem, and set his instruments at work to the utmost, to oppose anddiscourage them. The Israelites earnestly beg Samuel to pray for them.Oh what a comfort it is to all believers, that our great Intercessorabove never ceases, is never silent! for he always appears in thepresence of God for us. Samuel's sacrifice, without his prayer, hadbeen an empty shadow. God gave a gracious answer. And Samuel erected amemorial of this victory, to the glory of God, and to encourage Israel.Through successive generations, the church of God has had cause to setup Eben-ezers for renewed deliverances; neither outward persecutionsnor inward corruptions have prevailed against her, because "hithertothe Lord hath helped her:" and he will help, even to the end of theworld.
1Sa 7:13-17	<br>In this great revival of true religion, the ark was neither removed toShiloh, nor placed with the tabernacle any where else. This disregardto the Levitical institutions showed that their typical meaning formedtheir chief use; and when that was overlooked, they became a lifelessservice, not to be compared with repentance, faith, and the love of Godand man.
1Sa 8:1-3	<br>It does not appear that Samuel's sons were so profane and vicious asEli's sons; but they were corrupt judges, they turned aside afterlucre. Samuel took no bribes, but his sons did, and then they pervertedjudgment. What added to the grievance of the people was, that they werethreatened by an invasion from Nahash, king of the Ammonites.
1Sa 8:4-9	<br>Samuel was displeased; he could patiently bear what reflected onhimself, and his own family; but it displeased him when they said, Giveus a king to judge us, because that reflected upon God. It drove him tohis knees. When any thing disturbs us, it is our interest, as well asour duty, to show our trouble before God. Samuel is to tell them thatthey shall have a king. Not that God was pleased with their request,but as sometimes he opposes us from loving-kindness, so at other timeshe gratifies us in wrath; he did so here. God knows how to bring gloryto himself, and serves his own wise purposes, even by men's foolishcounsels.
1Sa 8:10-22	<br>If they would have a king to rule them, as the eastern kings ruledtheir subjects, they would find the yoke exceedingly heavy. Those thatsubmit to the government of the world and the flesh, are told plainly,what hard masters they are, and what tyranny the dominion of sin is.The law of God and the manner of men widely differ from each other; theformer should be our rule in the several relations of life; the lattershould be the measure of our expectations from others. These would betheir grievances, and, when they complained to God, he would not hearthem. When we bring ourselves into distress by our own wrong desiresand projects, we justly forfeit the comfort of prayer, and the benefitof Divine aid. The people were obstinate and urgent in their demand.Sudden resolves and hasty desires make work for long and leisurelyrepentance. Our wisdom is, to be thankful for the advantages, andpatient under the disadvantages of the government we may live under;and to pray continually for our rulers, that they may govern us in thefear of God, and that we may live under them in all godliness andhonesty. And it is a hopeful symptom when our desires of worldlyobjects can brook delay; and when we can refer the time and manner oftheir being granted to God's providence.
1Sa 9:1-10	<br>Saul readily went to seek his father's asses. His obedience to hisfather was praise-worthy. His servant proposed, that since they werenow at Ramah, they should call on Samuel, and take his advice. Whereverwe are, we should use our opportunities of acquainting ourselves withthose who are wise and good. Many will consult a man of God, if hecomes in their way, that would not go a step out of their way to getwisdom. We sensibly feel worldly losses, and bestow much pains to makethem up; but how little do we attempt, and how soon are we weary, inseeking the salvation of our souls! If ministers could tell men how tosecure their property, or to get wealth, they would be more consultedand honoured than they now are, though employed in teaching them how toescape eternal misery, and to obtain eternal life. Most people wouldrather be told their fortune than their duty. Samuel needed not theirmoney, nor would he have denied his advice, if they had not brought it;but they gave it to him as a token of respect, and of the value theyput upon his office, and according to the general usage of those times,always to bring a present to those in authority.
1Sa 9:11-17	<br>The very maid-servants of the city could direct to the prophet. Theyhad heard of the sacrifice, and could tell of the necessity forSamuel's presence. It is no small benefit to live in religious and holyplaces. And we should always be ready to help those who are seekingafter God's prophets. Though God had, in displeasure, granted Israel'srequest for a king, yet he sends them a man to be captain over them, tosave them out of the hand of the Philistines. He does it, listeninggraciously to their cry.
1Sa 9:18-27	<br>Samuel, that good prophet, was so far from envying Saul, or bearing himany ill-will, that he was the first and most forward to do him honour.Both that evening and early the next morning, Samuel communed with Saulupon the flat roof of the house. We may suppose Samuel now convincedSaul that he was the person God had fixed upon for the government, andof his own willingness to resign. How different are the purposes of theLord for us, from our intentions for ourselves! Perhaps Saul was theonly one who ever went out to seek asses, and literally found akingdom; but many have set out and moved their dwellings to seek richesand pleasures, who have been guided to places where they foundsalvation for their souls. Thus they have met with those who addressedthem as if aware of the secrets of their lives and hearts, and havebeen led seriously to regard the word of the Lord. If this has been ourcase, though our worldly plans have not prospered, let us not care forthat; the Lord has given us, or has prepared us for, what is farbetter.
1Sa 10:1-8	<br>The sacred anointing, then used, pointed at the great Messiah, orAnointed One, the King of the church, and High Priest of ourprofession, who was anointed with the oil of the Spirit, not bymeasure, but without measure, and above all the priests and princes ofthe Jewish church. For Saul's further satisfaction, Samuel gives himsome signs which should come to pass the same day. The first place hedirects him to, was the sepulchre of one of his ancestors; there hemust be reminded of his own mortality, and now that he had a crownbefore him, must think of his grave, in which all his honour would belaid in the dust. From the time of Samuel there appears to have beenschools, or places where pious young men were brought up in theknowledge of Divine things. Saul should find himself strongly moved tojoin with them, and should be turned into another man from what he hadbeen. The Spirit of God changes men, wonderfully transforms them. Saul,by praising God in the communion of saints, became another man, but itmay be questioned if he became a new man.
1Sa 10:9-16	<br>The signs Samuel had given Saul, came to pass punctually; he found thatGod had given him another heart, another disposition of mind. Yet letnot an outward show of devotion, and a sudden change for the present,be too much relied on; Saul among the prophets was Saul still. Hisbeing anointed was kept private. He leaves it to God to carry on hisown work by Samuel, and sits still, to see how the matter will fall.
1Sa 10:17-27	<br>Samuel tells the people, Ye have this day rejected your God. So littlefond was Saul now of that power, which soon after, when he possessedit, he could not think of parting with, that he hid himself. It is goodto be conscious of our unworthiness and insufficiency for the servicesto which we are called; but men should not go into the contraryextreme, by refusing the employments to which the Lord and the churchcall them. The greater part of the people treated the matter withindifference. Saul modestly went home to his own house, but wasattended by a band of men whose hearts God disposed to support hisauthority. If the heart bend at any time the right way, it is becauseHe has touched it. One touch is enough when it is Divine. Othersdespised him. Thus differently are men affected to our exaltedRedeemer. There is a remnant who submit to him, and follow him whereverhe goes; they are those whose hearts God has touched, whom he has madewilling. But there are others who despise him, who ask, How shall thisman save us? They are offended in him, and they will be punished.
1Sa 11:1-11	<br>The first fruit of Saul's government was the rescue of Jabesh-gileadfrom the Ammonites. To save their lives, men will part with liberty,and even consent to have their eyes put out; is it then no wisdom topart with that sin which is as dear to us as our right eye, rather thanto be cast into hell-fire? See the faith and confidence of Saul, and,grounded thereon, his courage and resolution. See also his activity inthis business. When the Spirit of the Lord comes upon men, it will makethem expert, even without experience. When zeal for the glory of God,and love for the brethren, urge men to earnest efforts, and when God ispleased to help, great effects may speedily be produced.
1Sa 11:12-15	<br>They now honoured Saul whom they had despised; and if an enemy be madea friend, that is more to our advantage than to have him slain. Theonce despised Saviour will at length be acknowledged by all as theLord's own anointed king. As yet, upon his mercy-seat, he receives thesubmission of rebels, and even pleads their cause; but shortly, fromhis righteous tribunal, he will condemn all who persist in opposinghim.
1Sa 12:1-5	<br>Samuel not only cleared his own character, but set an example beforeSaul, while he showed the people their ingratitude to God and tohimself. There is a just debt which all men to their own good name,especially men in public stations, which is, to guard it against unjustblame and suspicions, that they may finish their course with honour, aswell as with joy. And that we have in our places lived honestly, willbe our comfort, under any slights and contempt that may be put upon us.
1Sa 12:6-15	<br>The work of ministers is to reason with people; not only to exhort anddirect, but to persuade, to convince men's judgments, and so to gaintheir wills and affections. Samuel reasons of the righteous acts of theLord. Those who follow God faithfully, he will enable to continuefollowing him. Disobedience would certainly be the ruin of Israel. Wemistake if we think that we can escape God's justice, by trying toshake off his dominion. If we resolve that God shall not rule us, yethe will judge us.
1Sa 12:16-25	<br>At Samuel's word, God sent thunder and rain, at a season of the yearwhen, in that country, the like was not seen. This was to convince themthey had done wickedly in asking a king; not only by its coming at anunusual time, in wheat harvest, and on a clear day, but by theprophet's giving notice of it before. He showed their folly in desiringa king to save them, rather than God, or Samuel; promising themselvesmore from an arm of flesh, than from the arm of God, or from the powerof prayer. Could their prince command such forces as the prophet coulddo by his prayers? It startled them very much. Some will not be broughtto see their sins by any gentler methods than storms and thunders. Theyentreat Samuel to pray for them. Now they see their need of him whomshortly before they slighted. Thus many who will not have Christ toreign over them, would yet be glad to have him intercede for them, toturn away the wrath of God. Samuel aims to confirm the people in theirreligion. Whatever we make a god of, we shall find it deceive us.Creatures in their own places are good; but when put in God's place,they are vain things. We sin if we restrain prayer, and in particularif we cease praying for the church. They only asked him to pray forthem; but he promises to do more, to teach them. He urges that theywere bound in gratitude to serve God, considering what great things hehad done for them; and that they were bound in interest to serve him,considering what he would do against them, if they should still dowickedly. Thus, as a faithful watchman, he gave them warning, and sodelivered his own soul. If we consider what great things the Lord hathdone for us, especially in the great work of redemption, we can neitherwant motive, encouragement, nor assistance in serving him.
1Sa 13:1-7	<br>Saul reigned one year, and nothing particular happened; but in hissecond year the events recorded in this chapter took place. For above ayear he gave the Philistine time to prepare for war, and to weaken andto disarm the Israelites. When men are lifted up in self-sufficiency,they are often led into folly. The chief advantages of the enemies ofthe church are derived from the misconduct of its professed friends.When Saul at length sounded an alarm, the people, dissatisfied with hismanagement, or terrified by the power of the enemy, did not come tohim, or speedily deserted him.
1Sa 13:8-14	<br>Saul broke the order expressly given by Samuel, see ch. 1Sa 10:8, as towhat should be done in cases of extremity. Saul offered sacrificewithout Samuel, and did it himself, though he was neither priest norprophet. When charged with disobedience, he justified himself in whathe had done, and gave no sign of repentance for it. He would have thisact of disobedience pass for an instance of his prudence, and as aproof of his piety. Men destitute of inward piety, often lay greatstress on the outward performances of religion. Samuel charges Saulwith being an enemy to himself. Those that disobey the commandments ofGod, do foolishly for themselves. Sin is folly, and the greatestsinners are the greatest fools. Our disposition to obey or disobey God,will often be proved by our behaviour in things which appear small. Mensee nothing but Saul's outward act, which seems small; but God saw thathe did this with unbelief and distrust of his providence, with contemptof his authority and justice, and with rebellion against the light ofhis own conscience. Blessed Saviour, may we never, like Saul, bring ourpoor offerings, or fancied peace-offerings, without looking to thyprecious, thy all-sufficient sacrifice! Thou only, O Lord, canst make,or hast made, our peace in the blood of the cross.
1Sa 13:15-23	<br>See how politic the Philistines were when they had power; they not onlyprevented the people of Israel from making weapons of war, but obligedthem to depend upon their enemies, even for instruments of husbandry.How impolitic Saul was, who did not, in the beginning of his reign, sethimself to redress this. Want of true sense always accompanies want ofgrace. Sins which appear to us very little, have dangerousconsequences. Miserable is a guilty, defenceless nation; much morethose who are destitute of the whole armour of God.
1Sa 14:1-15	<br>Saul seems to have been quite at a loss, and unable to help himself.Those can never think themselves safe who see themselves out of God'sprotection. Now he sent for a priest and the ark. He hopes to make upmatters with the Almighty by a partial reformation, as many do whosehearts are unhumbled and unchanged. Many love to have ministers whoprophesy smooth things to them. Jonathan felt a Divine impulse andimpression, putting him upon this bold adventure. God will direct thesteps of those that acknowledge him in all their ways, and seek to himfor direction, with full purpose of heart to follow his guidance.Sometimes we find most comfort in that which is least our own doing,and into which we have been led by the unexpected but well-observedturns of Divine providence. There was trembling in the host. It iscalled a trembling of God, signifying, not only a great trembling theycould not resist, nor reason themselves out of, but that it came atonce from the hand of God. He that made the heart, knows how to make ittremble.
1Sa 14:16-23	<br>The Philistines were, by the power of God, set against one another. Themore evident it was that God did all, the more reason Saul had toinquire whether God would give him leave to do any thing. But he was insuch haste to fight a fallen enemy, that he would not stay to end hisdevotions, nor hear what answer God would give him. He that believeth,will not make such haste, nor reckon any business so urgent, as not toallow time to take God with him.
1Sa 14:24-35	<br>Saul's severe order was very unwise; if it gained time, it loststrength for the pursuit. Such is the nature of our bodies, that dailywork cannot be done without daily bread, which therefore our Father inheaven graciously gives. Saul was turning aside from God, and now hebegins to build altars, being then most zealous, as many are, for theform of godliness when he was denying the power of it.
1Sa 14:36-46	<br>If God turns away our prayer, we have reason to suspect it is for somesin harboured in our hearts, which we should find out, that we may putit away, and put it to death. We should always first suspect andexamine ourselves; but an unhumbled heart suspects every other person,and looks every where but at home for the sinful cause of calamity.Jonathan was discovered to be the offender. Those most indulgent totheir own sins are most severe upon others; those who most disregardGod's authority, are most impatient when their own commands areslighted. Such as cast abroad curses, endanger themselves and theirfamilies. What do we observe in the whole of Saul's behaviour on thisoccasion, but an impetuous, proud, malignant, impious disposition? Anddo we not in every instance perceive that man, left to himself, betraysthe depravity of his nature, and is enslaved to the basest tempers.
1Sa 14:47-52	<br>Here is a general account of Saul's court and camp. He had littlereason to be proud of his royal dignity, nor had any of his neighbourscause to envy him, for he had but little enjoyment after he took thekingdom. And often men's earthly glory makes a blaze just before thedark night of disgrace and woe comes on them.
1Sa 15:1-9	<br>The sentence of condemnation against the Amalekites had gone forth longbefore, Ex 17:14; De 25:19, but they had been spared till they filledup the measure of their sins. We are sure that the righteous Lord doesno injustice to any. The remembering the kindness of the ancestors ofthe Kenites, in favour to them, at the time God was punishing theinjuries done by the ancestors of the Amalekites, tended to clear therighteousness of God in this dispensation. It is dangerous to be foundin the company of God's enemies, and it is our duty and interest tocome out from among them, lest we share in their sins and plagues, Re18:4. As the commandment had been express, and a test of Saul'sobedience, his conduct evidently was the effect of a proud, rebelliousspirit. He destroyed only the refuse, that was good for little. Thatwhich was now destroyed was sacrificed to the justice of God.
1Sa 15:10-23	<br>Repentance in God is not a change of mind, as it is in us, but a changeof method. The change was in Saul; "He is turned back from followingme." Hereby he made God his enemy. Samuel spent a whole night inpleading for Saul. The rejection of sinners is the grief of believers:God delights not in their death, nor should we. Saul boasts to Samuelof his obedience. Thus sinners think, by justifying themselves, toescape being judged of the Lord. The noise the cattle made, like therust of the silver, Jas 5:3, witnessed against him. Many boast ofobedience to the command of God; but what means then their indulgenceof the flesh, their love of the world, their angry and unkind spirit,and their neglect of holy duties, which witness against them? See ofwhat evil covetousness is the root; and see what is the sinfulness ofsin, and notice that in it which above any thing else makes it evil inthe sight of the Lord; it is disobedience: "Thou didst not obey thevoice of the Lord." Carnal, deceitful hearts, like Saul, think toexcuse themselves from God's commandments by what pleases themselves.It is hard to convince the children of disobedience. But humble,sincere, and conscientious obedience to the will of God, is morepleasing and acceptable to him than all burnt-offering and sacrifices.God is more glorified and self more denied, by obedience than bysacrifice. It is much easier to bring a bullock or lamb to be burnedupon the altar, than to bring every high thought into obedience to God,and to make our will subject to his will. Those are unfit and unworthyto rule over men, who are not willing that God should rule over them.
1Sa 15:24-31	<br>There were several signs of hypocrisy in Saul's repentance. 1. Hebesought Samuel only, and seemed most anxious to stand right in hisopinion, and to gain his favour. 2. He excuses his fault, even whenconfessing it; that is never the way of a true penitent. 3. All hiscare was to save his credit, and preserve his interest in the people.Men are fickle and alter their minds, feeble and cannot effect theirpurposes; something happens they could not foresee, by which theirmeasures are broken; but with God it is not so. The Strength of Israelwill not lie.
1Sa 15:32-35	<br>Many think the bitterness of death is past when it is not gone by; theyput that evil day far from them, which is very near. Samuel calls Agagto account for his own sins. He followed the example of his ancestors'cruelty, justly therefore is all the righteous blood shed by Amalekrequired. Saul seems unconcerned at the token of God's displeasurewhich he lay under, yet Samuel mourns day and night for him. Jerusalemwas carnally secure while Christ wept over it. Do we desire to do thewhole will of God? Turn to him, not in form and appearance, but withsincerity.
1Sa 16:1-5	<br>It appears that Saul was grown very wicked. Of what would he not beguilty, who durst think to kill Samuel? The elders of Bethlehemtrembled at Samuel's coming. It becomes us to stand in awe of God'smessengers, and to tremble at his word. His answer was, I comepeaceably, for I come to sacrifice. When our Lord Jesus came into theworld, though men had reason to fear that his errand was to condemn theworld, yet he gave full assurance that he came peaceably, for he cameto sacrifice, and he brought his offering with him; A body hast thouprepared me. Let us sanctify ourselves, and depend upon His sacrifice.
1Sa 16:6-13	<br>It was strange that Samuel, who had been so disappointed in Saul, whosecountenance and stature recommended him, should judge of another man bythat rule. We can tell how men look, but God can tell what they are. Hejudges of men by the heart. We often form a mistaken judgment ofcharacters; but the Lord values only the faith, fear, and love, whichare planted in the heart, beyond human discernment. And God does notfavour our children according to our fond partiality, but often mosthonours and blesses those who have been least regarded. David at lengthwas pitched upon. He was the youngest of the sons of Jesse; his namesignifies Beloved; he was a type of God's beloved Son. It should seem,David was least set by of all the sons of Jesse. But the Spirit of theLord came upon David from that day forward. His anointing was not anempty ceremony, a Divine power went with that instituted sign; he foundhimself advanced in wisdom and courage, with all the qualifications ofa prince, though not advanced in his outward circumstances. This wouldsatisfy him that his election was of God. The best evidence of ourbeing predestinated to the kingdom of glory, is, our being sealed withthe Spirit of promise, and experience of a work of grace in our hearts.
1Sa 16:14-23	<br>Saul is made a terror to himself. The Spirit of the Lord departed fromhim. If God and his grace do not rule us, sin and Satan will havepossession of us. The devil, by the Divine permission, troubled andterrified Saul, by the corrupt humours of his body, and passions of hismind. He grew fretful, peevish, and discontented, and at times amadman. It is a pity that music, which may be serviceable to the goodtemper of the mind, should ever be abused, to support vanity andluxury, and made an occasion of drawing the heart from God and seriousthings. That is driving away the good Spirit, not the evil spirit.Music, diversions, company, or business, have for a time often beenemployed to quiet the wounded conscience; but nothing can effect a realcure but the blood of Christ, applied in faith, and the sanctifyingSpirit sealing the pardon, by his holy comforts. All other plans todispel religious melancholy are sure to add to distress, either in thisworld or the next.
1Sa 17:1-11	<br>Men so entirely depend upon God in all things, that when he withdrawshis help, the most valiant and resolute cannot find their hearts orhands, as daily experience shows.
1Sa 17:12-30	<br>Jesse little thought of sending his son to the army at that criticaljuncture; but the wise God orders actions and affairs, so as to servehis designs. In times of general formality and lukewarmness, everydegree of zeal which implies readiness to go further, or to venturemore in the cause of God than others, will be blamed as pride andambition, and by none more than by near relations, like Eliab, ornegligent superiors. It was a trial of David's meekness, patience, andconstancy. He had right and reason on his side, and did not renderrailing for railing; with a soft answer he turned away his brother'swrath. This conquest of his own passion was more honourable than thatof Goliath. Those who undertake great and public services, must notthink it strange if they are spoken ill of, and opposed by those fromwhom they expect support and assistance. They must humbly go on withtheir work, in the face not only of enemies' threats, but of friends'slights and suspicions.
1Sa 17:31-39	<br>A shepherd lad, come the same morning from keeping sheep, had morecourage than all the mighty men of Israel. Thus God often sends goodwords to his Israel, and does great things for them, by the weak andfoolish things of the world. As he had answered his brother's passionwith meekness, so David answered Saul's fear with faith. When Davidkept sheep, he proved himself very careful and tender of his flock.This reminds us of Christ, the good Shepherd, who not only ventured,but laid down his life for the sheep. Our experience ought to encourageus to trust in God, and be bold in the way of duty. He that hasdelivered, does and will continue to do so. David gained leave to fightthe Philistine. Not being used to such armour as Saul put upon him, hewas not satisfied to go in that manner; this was from the Lord, that itmight more plainly appear he fought and conquered in faith, and thatthe victory was from Him who works by the feeblest and most despisedmeans and instruments. It is not to be inquired how excellent any thingis, but how proper. Let Saul's coat be ever so rich, and his armourever so strong, what is David the better if they fit him not? Butfaith, prayer, truth, and righteousness; the whole armour of God, andthe mind that was in Christ; are equally needful for all the servantsof the Lord, whatever may be their work.
1Sa 17:40-47	<br>The security and presumption of fools destroy them. Nothing can excelthe humility, faith, and piety which appear in David's words. Heexpressed his assured expectation of success; he gloried in his meanappearance and arms, that the victory might be ascribed to the Lordalone.
1Sa 17:48-58	<br>See how frail and uncertain life is, even when a man thinks himselfbest fortified; how quickly, how easily, and by how small a matter, thepassage may be opened for life to go out, and death to enter! Let notthe strong man glory in his strength, nor the armed man in his armour.God resists the proud, and pours contempt on those who defy him and hispeople. No one ever hardened his heart against God and prospered. Thehistory is recorded, that all may exert themselves for the honour ofGod, and the support of his cause, with bold and unshaken reliance onhim. There is one conflict in which all the followers of the Lamb are,and must be engaged; one enemy, more formidable than Goliath, stillchallenges the armies of Israel. But "resist the devil, and he willflee from you." Go forth to battle with the faith of David, and thepowers of darkness shall not stand against you. But how often is theChristian foiled through an evil heart of unbelief!
1Sa 18:1-5	<br>The friendship of David and Jonathan was the effect of Divine grace,which produces in true believers one heart and one soul, and causesthem to love each other. This union of souls is from partaking in theSpirit of Christ. Where God unites hearts, carnal matters are too weakto separate them. Those who love Christ as their own souls, will bewilling to join themselves to him in an everlasting covenant. It wascertainly a great proof of the power of God's grace in David, that hewas able to bear all this respect and honour, without being lifted upabove measure.
1Sa 18:6-11	<br>David's troubles not only immediately follow his triumphs, but arisefrom them; such is the vanity of that which seems greatest in thisworld. It is a sign that the Spirit of God is departed from men, if,like Saul, they are peevish, envious, suspicious, and ill-natured.Compare David, with his harp in his hand, aiming to serve Saul, andSaul, with his javelin in his hand, aiming to slay David; and observethe sweetness and usefulness of God's persecuted people, and thebarbarity of their persecutors. But David's safety must be ascribed toGod's providence.
1Sa 18:12-30	<br>For a long time David was kept in continual apprehension of falling bythe hand of Saul, yet he persevered in meek and respectful behaviourtowards his persecutor. How uncommon is such prudence and discretion,especially under insults and provocations! Let us inquire if we imitatethis part of the exemplary character before us. Are we behaving wiselyin all our ways? Is there no sinful omission, no rashness of spirit,nothing wrong in our conduct? Opposition and perverseness in others,will not excuse wrong tempers in us, but should increase our care, andattention to the duties of our station. Consider Him that enduredcontradiction of sinners against himself, lest ye be weary and faint inyour minds, Heb 12:3. If David magnified the honour of being son-in-lawto king Saul, how should we magnify the honour of being sons to theKing of kings!
1Sa 19:1-10	<br>How forcible are right words! Saul was, for a time, convinced of theunreasonableness of his enmity to David; but he continued his maliceagainst David. So incurable is the hatred of the seed of the serpentagainst that of the woman; so deceitful and desperately wicked is theheart of man without the grace of God, Jer 17:9.
1Sa 19:11-24	<br>Michal's stratagem to gain time till David got to a distance wasallowable, but her falsehood had not even the plea of necessity toexcuse it, and manifests that she was not influenced by the same spiritof piety which had dictated Jonathan's language to Saul. In flying toSamuel, David made God his refuge. Samuel, as a prophet, was best ableto advise him what to do in this day of distress. He met with littlerest or satisfaction in Saul's court, therefore went to seek it inSamuel's church. What little pleasure is to be had in this world, thosehave who live a life of communion with God; to that David returned inthe time of trouble. So impatient was Saul after David's blood, sorestless against him, that although baffled by one providence afteranother, he could not see that David was under the special protectionof God. And when God will take this way to protect David, even Saulprophesies. Many have great gifts, yet no grace; they may prophesy inChrist's name, yet are disowned by him. Let us daily seek for renewinggrace, which shall be in us as a well of water springing up intoeverlasting life. Let us cleave to truth and holiness with full purposeof heart. In every danger and trouble, let us seek protection, comfort,and direction in God's ordinances.
1Sa 20:1-10	<br>The trials David met with, prepared him for future advancement. Thusthe Lord deals with those whom he prepares unto glory. He does not putthem into immediate possession of the kingdom, but leads them to itthrough much tribulation, which he makes the means of fitting them forit. Let them not murmur at his gracious appointment, nor distrust hiscare; but let them look forward with joyful expectation to the crownwhich is laid up for them. Sometimes it appears to us that there is buta step between us and death; at all times it may be so, and we shouldprepare for the event. But though dangers appear most threatening, wecannot die till the purpose of God concerning us is accomplished; nortill we have served our generation according to his will, if we arebelievers. Jonathan generously offers David his services. This is truefriendship. Thus Christ testifies his love to us, Ask, and it shall bedone for you; and we must testify our love to him, by keeping hiscommandments.
1Sa 20:11-23	<br>Jonathan faithfully promises that he would let David know how he foundhis father affected towards him. It will be kindness to ourselves andto ours, to secure an interest in those whom God favours, and to makehis friends ours. True friendship rests on a firm basis, and is able tosilence ambition, self-love, and undue regard for others. But who canfully understand the love of Jesus, who gave himself as a sacrifice forrebellious, polluted sinners! how great then ought to be the force andeffects of our love to him, to his cause, and his people!
1Sa 20:24-34	<br>None were more constant than David in attending holy duties; nor had hebeen absent, but self-preservation obliged him to withdraw. In greatperil present opportunities for Divine ordinances may be waved. But itis bad for us, except in case of necessity, to omit any opportunity ofstatedly attending on them. Jonathan did wisely and well for himselfand family, to secure an interest in David, yet for this he is blamed.It is good to take God's people for our people. It will prove to ouradvantage at last, however it may now be thought against our interest.Saul was outrageous. What savage beasts, and worse, does anger makemen!
1Sa 20:35-42	<br>The separation of two such faithful friends was grievous to both, butDavid's case was the more deplorable, for David was leaving all hiscomforts, even those of God's sanctuary. Christians need not sorrow, asmen without hope; but being one with Christ, they are one with eachother, and will meet in his presence ere long, to part no more; to meetwhere all tears shall be wiped from their eyes.
1Sa 21:1-9	<br>David, in distress, fled to the tabernacle of God. It is great comfortin a day of trouble, that we have a God to go to, to whom we may openour cases, and from whom we may ask and expect direction. David toldAhimelech a gross untruth. What shall we say to this? The Scripturedoes not conceal it, and we dare not justify it; it was ill done, andproved of bad consequence; for it occasioned the death of the priestsof the Lord. David thought upon it afterward with regret. David hadgreat faith and courage, yet both failed him; he fell thus foullythrough fear and cowardice, and owing to the weakness of his faith. Hadhe trusted God aright, he would not have used such a sorry, sinfulshift for his own preservation. It is written, not for us to do thelike, no, not in the greatest straits, but for our warning. David askedof Ahimelech bread and a sword. Ahimelech supposed they might eat theshew-bread. The Son of David taught from it, that mercy is to bepreferred to sacrifice; that ritual observances must give way to moralduties. Doeg set his foot as far within the tabernacle as David did. Welittle know with what hearts people come to the house of God, nor whatuse they will make of pretended devotion. If many come in simplicity ofheart to serve their God, others come to observe their teachers and toprove accusers. Only God and the event can distinguish between a Davidand a Doeg, when both are in the tabernacle. (1Sa 21:10-15)
1Sa 21:10-15	<br>God's persecuted people have often found better usage from Philistinesthan from Israelites. David had reason to put confidence in Achish, yethe began to be afraid. His conduct was degrading, and discoveredwavering in his faith and courage. The more simply we depend on God,and obey him, the more comfortably and surely we shall walk throughthis troublesome world.
1Sa 22:1-5	<br>See what weak instruments God sometimes uses, to bring about his ownpurposes. The Son of David is ready to receive distressed souls, whowill be commanded by him. He receives all who come unto Him, howevervile and miserable; he changes them into a holy people, and employsthem in his service: those who would reign with him must be contentedfirst to suffer with and for him. Observe with what tender concernDavid provided for his aged parents. The first thing he does is to findthem a quiet habitation, whatever became of himself. Let children learnto honour their parents, in every thing consulting their ease andsatisfaction. Though highly preferred, and much employed, let them notforget their aged parents. The steps of a good man are ordered by theLord. And the Lord will preserve his people for their appointed work,however they may be hated and exposed.
1Sa 22:6-19	<br>See the nature of jealous malice and its pitiful arts. Saul looks uponall about him as his enemies, because they do not just say as he says.In Ahimelech's answer to Saul we have the language of consciousinnocence. But what wickedness will not the evil spirit hurry men towhen he gets the dominion! Saul alleges that which was utterly falseand unproved. But the most bloody tyrants have found instruments oftheir cruelty as barbarous as themselves. Doeg, having murdered thepriests, went to the city, Nob, and put all to the sword there. Nothingso vile but those may do it, who have provoked God to give them up totheir hearts' lusts. Yet this was the accomplishment of thethreatenings against the house of Eli. Though Saul was unrighteous indoing this, yet God was righteous in permitting it. No word of Godshall fall to the ground.
1Sa 22:20-23	<br>David greatly lamented the calamity. It is great trouble to a good manto find himself any way the cause of evil to others. He must have beenmuch pained, when he considered that his falsehood was one cause ofthis fatal event. David speaks with assurance of his own safety, andpromises that Abiathar should have his protection. With the Son ofDavid, all who are his may be sure they shall be in safeguard, Ps 91:1.In the hurry and distraction David was continually in, he found timefor communion with God, and found comfort in it.
1Sa 23:1-6	<br>When princes persecute God's people, let them expect vexation on allsides. The way for any country to be quiet, is to let God's church bequiet in it: if Saul fight against David, the Philistines fight againsthis country. David considered himself the protector of the land. Thusdid the Saviour Jesus, and left us an example. Those are unlike David,who sullenly decline to do good, if they are not rewarded for services.
1Sa 23:7-13	<br>Well might David complain of his enemies, that they rewarded him evilfor good, and that for his love they were his adversaries. Christ wasused thus basely. David applied to his great Protector for direction.No sooner was the ephod brought him than he made use of it. We have theScriptures in our hands, let us take advice from them in doubtfulcases. Say, Bring hither the Bible. David's address to God is verysolemn, also very particular. God allows us to be so in our addressesto him; Lord, direct me in this matter, about which I am now at a loss.God knows not only what will be, but what would be, if it were nothindered; therefore he knows how to deliver the godly out oftemptation, and how to render to every man according to his works.
1Sa 23:14-18	<br>David made no attempt against Saul; he kept God's way, waited God'stime, and was content to secure himself in woods and wildernesses. Letit make us think the worse of this world, which often gives such badtreatment to its best men: let it make us long for that kingdom wheregoodness shall for ever be in glory, and holiness in honour. We findJonathan comforting David. As a pious friend, he directed him to God,the Foundation of his comfort. As a self-denying friend, he takespleasure in the prospect of David's advancement to the throne. As aconstant friend, he renewed his friendship with him. Our covenant withGod should be often renewed, and therein our communion with him keptup. If the converse of one friend, at one meeting, gives comfort andstrengthens our hearts, what may not be expected from the continualsupports and powerful love of the Saviour of sinners, the covenantedFriend of believers!
1Sa 23:19-29	<br>In the midst of his wickedness, Saul affected to speak the language ofpiety. Such expressions, without suitable effects, can only amuse ordeceive those who hear, and those who use them. This mountain was anemblem of the Divine Providence coming between David and the destroyer.Let us not be dismayed at the prospect of future difficulties, but stayourselves upon Him who is wonderful in counsel and excellent inworking. Sooner than his promise shall fail, he will commissionPhilistines to effect our escape, at the very moment when our caseappears most desperate. God requires entire dependence on him, If yewill not believe, surely ye shall not be established, Isa 7:9.
1Sa 24:1-7	<br>God delivered Saul into David's hand. It was an opportunity given toDavid to exercise faith and patience. He had a promise of the kingdom,but no command to slay the king. He reasons strongly, both with himselfand with his men, against doing Saul any hurt. Sin is a thing which itbecomes us to startle at, and to resist temptations thereto. He notonly would not do this bad thing himself, but he would not suffer thoseabout him to do it. Thus he rendered good for evil, to him from whom hereceived evil for good; and was herein an example to all who are calledChristians, not to be overcome of evil, but to overcome evil with good.
1Sa 24:8-15	<br>David was falsely charged with seeking Saul's hurt; he shows Saul thatGod's providence had given him opportunity to do it. And it was upon agood principle that he refused to do it. He declares his fixedresolution never to be his own avenger. If men wrong us, God will rightus, at farthest, in the judgment of the great day.
1Sa 24:16-22	<br>Saul speaks as quite overcome with David's kindness. Many mourn fortheir sins, who do not truly repent of them; weep bitterly for them,yet continue in love and in league with them. Now God made good toDavid that word on which he had caused him to hope, that he would bringforth his righteousness as the light, Ps 37:6. Those who take care tokeep a good conscience, may leave it to God to secure them the creditof it. Sooner or later, God will force even those who are of thesynagogue of Satan to know and to own those whom he has loved. Theyparted in peace. Saul went home convinced, but not converted; ashamedof his envy to David, yet retaining in his breast that root ofbitterness; vexed that when at last he had found David, he could notfind in his heart to destroy him, as he had designed. Malice oftenseems dead when it is only asleep, and will revive with double force.Yet, whether the Lord bind men's hands, or affect their hearts, so thatthey do not hurt us, the deliverance is equally from him; it is anevidence of his love, and an earnest of our salvation, and should makeus thankful.
1Sa 25:2-11	<br>We should not have heard of Nabal, if nothing had passed between himand David. Observe his name, Nabal, "A fool;" so it signifies. Richesmake men look great in the eye of the world; but to one that takesright views, Nabal looked very mean. He had no honour or honesty; hewas churlish, cross, and ill-humoured; evil in his doings, hard andoppressive; a man that cared not what fraud and violence he used ingetting and saving. What little reason have we to value the wealth ofthis world, when so great a churl as Nabal abounds, and so good a manas David suffers want!, David pleaded the kindness Nabal's shepherdshad received. Considering that David's men were in distress and debt,and discontented, and the scarcity of provisions, it was by goodmanagement that they were kept from plundering. Nabal went into apassion, as covetous men are apt to do, when asked for any thing,thinking thus to cover one sin with another; and, by abusing the poor,to excuse themselves from relieving them. But God will not thus bemocked. Let this help us to bear reproaches and misrepresentations withpatience and cheerfulness, and make us easy under them; it has oftenbeen the lot of the excellent ones of the earth. Nabal insists much onthe property he had in the provisions of his table. May he not do whathe will with his own? We mistake, if we think we are absolute lords ofwhat we have, and may do what we please with it. No; we are butstewards, and must use it as we are directed, remembering it is not ourown, but His who intrusted us with it.
1Sa 25:12-17	<br>God is kind to the evil and unthankful, and why may not we be so? Daviddetermined to destroy Nabal, and all that belonged to him. Is this thyvoice, O David? Has he been so long in the school of affliction, wherehe should have learned patience, and yet is so passionate? He at othertimes was calm and considerate, but is put into such a heat by a fewhard words, that he seeks to destroy a whole family. What are the bestof men, when God leaves them to themselves, that they may know what isin their hearts? What need to pray, Lord, lead us not into temptation!
1Sa 25:18-31	<br>By a present Abigail atoned for Nabal's denial of David's request. Herbehaviour was very submissive. Yielding pacifies great offences. Sheputs herself in the place of a penitent, and of a petitioner. She couldnot excuse her husband's conduct. She depends not upon her ownreasonings, but on God's grace, to soften David, and expects that gracewould work powerfully. She says that it was below him to take vengeanceon so weak and despicable an enemy as Nabal, who, as he would do him nokindness, so he could do him no hurt. She foretells the glorious end ofDavid's present troubles. God will preserve thy life; therefore itbecomes not thee unjustly and unnecessarily to take away the lives ofany, especially of the people of thy God and Saviour. Abigail keepsthis argument for the last, as very powerful with so good a man; thatthe less he indulged his passion, the more he consulted his peace andthe repose of his own conscience. Many have done that in a heat, whichthey have a thousand times wished undone again. The sweetness ofrevenge is soon turned into bitterness. When tempted to sin, we shouldconsider how it will appear when we think upon it afterwards.
1Sa 25:32-39	<br>David gives God thanks for sending him this happy check in a sinfulway. Whoever meet us with counsel, direction, comfort, caution, orseasonable reproof, we must see God sending them. We ought to be verythankful for those happy providences which are the means of keeping usfrom sinning. Most people think it enough, if they take reproofpatiently; but few will take it thankfully, and commend those who giveit, and accept it as a favour. The nearer we are to committing sin, thegreater is the mercy of a seasonable restraint. Sinners are often mostsecure when most in danger. He was very drunk. A sign he was Nabal, afool, that could not use plenty without abusing it; who could not bepleasant with his friends without making a beast of himself. There isnot a surer sign that a man has but little wisdom, nor a surer way todestroy the little he has, than drinking to excess. Next morning, howhe is changed! His heart overnight merry with wine, next morning heavyas a stone; so deceitful are carnal pleasures, so soon passes thelaughter of the fool; the end of that mirth is heaviness. Drunkards aresad, when they reflect upon their own folly. About ten days after, theLord smote Nabal, that he died. David blessed God that he had been keptfrom killing Nabal. Worldly sorrow, mortified pride, and an affrightedconscience, sometimes end the joys of the sensualist, and separate thecovetous man from his wealth; but, whatever the weapon, the Lord smitesmen with death when it pleases him.
1Sa 25:39-44	<br>Abigail believed that David would be king over Israel, and greatlyesteemed his pious and excellent character. She deemed his proposal ofmarriage honourable, and advantageous to her, notwithstanding hispresent difficulties. With great humility, and doubtless agreeably tothe customs of those times, she consented, being willing to share histrails. Thus those who join themselves to Christ, must be willing nowto suffer with him, believing that hereafter they shall reign with him.
1Sa 26:1-12	<br>How soon do unholy hearts lose the good impressions convictions havemade upon them! How helpless were Saul and all his men! All as thoughdisarmed and chained, yet nothing is done to them; they are onlyasleep. How easily can God weaken the strongest, befool the wisest, andbaffle the most watchful! David still resolved to wait till God thoughtfit to avenge him on Saul. He will by no means force his way to thepromised crown by any wrong methods. The temptation was very strong;but if he yielded, he would sin against God, therefore he resisted thetemptation, and trusted God with the event.
1Sa 26:13-20	<br>David reasoned seriously and affectionately with Saul. Those who forbidour attendance on God's ordinances, do what they can to estrange usfrom God, and to make us heathens. We are to reckon that which exposesus to sin the greatest injury that can be done us. If the Lord stirredthee up against me, either in displeasure to me, taking this way topunish me for my sins against him, or in displeasure to thee, if it bethe effect of that evil spirit from the Lord which troubles thee; letHim accept an offering from us both. Let us join in seeking peace, andto be reconciled with God by sacrifice.
1Sa 26:21-25	<br>Saul repeated his good words and good wishes. But he showed no evidenceof true repentance towards God. David and Saul parted to meet no more.No reconciliation among men is firm, which is not founded in ancemented by peace with God through Jesus Christ. In sinning againstGod, men play the fool, and err exceedingly. Many obtain a passing viewof these truths, who hate and close their eyes against the light. Fairprofessions do not entitle those to confidence who have long sinnedagainst the light, yet the confessions of obstinate sinners may satisfyus that we are in the right way, and encourage us to persevere,expecting our recompence from the Lord alone.
1Sa 27:1-7	<br>Unbelief is a sin that easily besets even good men, when without arefightings, and within are fears; and it is a hard matter to get overthem. Lord, increase our faith! We may blush to think that the word ofa Philistine should go further than the word of an Israelite, and thatthe city of Gath should be a place of refuge for a good man, when thecities of Israel refuse him a safe abode. David gained a comfortablesettlement, not only at a distance from Gath, but bordering uponIsrael, where he might keep up a correspondence with his owncountrymen.
1Sa 27:8-12	<br>While David was in the land of the Philistines, he attacked someremains of the devoted nations. The people whom he cut off were longbefore doomed to destruction. It is often wisdom to shun public notice,but we must in no situation be idle. We must always try to do somewhatin the cause of God. This expedition David hid from Achish. But anequivocation which serves the purpose of a lie, is as like to it as ahypocrite is to a profane person, it is only better in appearance,therefore more dangerous. Yet, though believers often manifestimperfections, they can never be prevailed upon to renounce the serviceof God, and to unite interests with his enemies, or finally to becomethe servants of sin and Satan. But what a train of evils follow fromunbelief! When we forget the Lord's past mercies, and his graciousassurances, we shall be overwhelmed with desponding fears, and probablybe led to adopt some dishonourable method to get rid of our troubles.Nothing can so effectually establish us in holy tempers and practices,and preserve us from perplexities, as firm, unshaken dependence uponthe promises of God in Christ Jesus.
1Sa 28:1-6	<br>David could not refuse Achish without danger. If he promisedassistance, and then stood neuter, or went over to the Israelites, hewould behave with ingratitude and treachery. If he fought againstIsrael, he would sin greatly. It seemed impossible that he should getout of this difficulty with a clear conscience; but his evasive answer,intended to gain time, was not consistent with the character of anIsraelite indeed. Troubles are terrors to the children of disobedience.In his distress, Saul inquired of the Lord. He did not seek in faith,but with a double, unstable mind. Saul had put the law in force againstthose that had familiar spirits, Ex 22:18. Many seem zealous against,sin, when they are any way hurt by it, who have no concern for theglory of God, nor any dislike of sin as sin. Many seem enemies to sinin others, while they indulge it in themselves. Saul will drive thedevil out of his kingdom, yet harbours him in his heart by envy andmalice. How foolish to consult those whom, according to God's law, hehad endeavoured to root out!
1Sa 28:7-19	<br>When we go from the plain path of duty, every thing draws us furtheraside, and increases our perplexity and temptation. Saul desires thewoman to bring one from the dead, with whom he wished to speak; thiswas expressly forbidden, De 18:11. All real or pretended witchcraft orconjuration, is a malicious or an ignorant attempt to gain knowledge orhelp from some creature, when it cannot be had from the Lord in thepath of duty. While Samuel was living, we never read of Saul's going toadvise with him in any difficulties; it had been well for him if hehad. But now he is dead, "Bring me up Samuel." Many who despise andpersecute God's saints and ministers when living, would be glad to havethem again, when they are gone. The whole shows that it was no humanfraud or trick. Though the woman could not cause Samuel's being sent,yet Saul's inquiry might be the occasion of it. The woman's surpriseand terror proved that it was an unusual and unexpected appearance.Saul had despised Samuel's solemn warnings in his lifetime, yet nowthat he hoped, as in defiance of God, to obtain some counsel andencouragement from him, might not God permit the soul of his departedprophet to appear to Saul, to confirm his former sentence, and denouncehis doom? The expression, "Thou and thy sons shall be with me," meansno more than that they shall be in the eternal world. There appearsmuch solemnity in God's permitting the soul of a departed prophet tocome as a witness from heaven, to confirm the word he had spoken onearth.
1Sa 28:20-25	<br>Those that expect any good counsel or comfort, otherwise than from God,and in the way of his institutions, will be as wretchedly disappointedas Saul. Though terrified even to despair, he was not humbled. Heconfessed not his sins, offered no sacrifices, and presented nosupplications. He does not seem to have cared about his sons or hispeople, or to have attempted any escape; but in sullen despair herushed upon his doom. God sets up a few such beacons, to warn men notto stifle convictions, or despise his word. But while one repentingthought remains, let no sinner suppose himself in this case. Let himhumble himself before God, determined to live and die beseeching hisfavour, and he will succeed.
1Sa 29:1-5	<br>David waited with a secret hope that the Lord would help him out of hisdifficulty. But he seems to have been influenced too much by the fearof man, in consenting to attend Achish. It is hard to come near to thebrink of sin, and not to fall in. God inclined the princes of thePhilistines to oppose David's being employed in the battle. Thus theirdislike befriended him, when no friend could do him such a kindness.
1Sa 29:6-11	<br>David scarcely ever had a greater deliverance than when dismissed fromsuch insnaring service. God's people should always behave themselvesso, as, if possible, to get the good word of all they have dealingswith: and it is due to those who have acted well, to speak well ofthem.
1Sa 30:1-6	<br>When we go abroad in the way of our duty, we may comfortably hope thatGod will take care of our families in our absence, but not otherwise.If, when we come off a journey, we find our abode in peace, and notlaid waste, as David here found his, let the Lord be praised for it.David's men murmured against him. Great faith must expect such severetrials. But, observe, that David was brought thus low, only just beforehe was raised to the throne. When things are at the worst with thechurch and people of God, then they begin to mend. David encouragedhimself in the Lord his God. His men fretted at their loss, the soul ofthe people was bitter; their own discontent and impatience added to theaffliction and misery. But David bore it better, though he had morereason than any of them to lament it. They gave liberty to theirpassions, but he set his graces to work; and while they dispirited eachother, he, by encouraging himself in God, kept his spirit calm. Thosewho have taken the Lord for their God, may take encouragement from himin the worst times.
1Sa 30:7-15	<br>If in all our ways, even when, as in this case, there can be no doubtthey are just, we acknowledge God, we may expect that he will directour steps, as he did those of David. David, in tenderness to his men,would by no means urge them beyond their strength. The Son of Davidthus considers the frames of his followers, who are not all alikestrong and vigorous in their spiritual pursuits and conflicts; but,where we are weak, there he is kind; nay more, there he is strong, 2Co12:9,10. A poor Egyptian lad, scarcely alive, is made the means of agreat deal of good to David. Justly did Providence make this poorservant, who was basely used by his master, an instrument in thedestruction of the Amalekites; for God hears the cry of the oppressed.Those are unworthy the name of true Israelites, who shut up theircompassion from persons in distress. We should neither do an injury nordeny a kindness to any man; some time or other it may be in the powerof the lowest to return a kindness or an injury.
1Sa 30:16-20	<br>Sinners are nearest to ruin, when they cry, Peace and safety, and putthe evil day far from them. Nor does any thing give our spiritualenemies more advantage than sensuality and indulgence. Eating anddrinking, and dancing, have been the soft and pleasant way in whichmany have gone down to the congregation of the dead. The spoil wasrecovered, and brought off; nothing was lost, but a great deal gained.
1Sa 30:21-31	<br>What God gives us, he designs we should do good with. In distributingthe spoil, David was just and kind. Those are men of Belial indeed, whodelight in putting hardships upon their brethren, and care not who isstarved, so that they may be fed to the full. David was generous andkind to all his friends. Those who consider the Lord as the Giver oftheir abundance, will dispose of it with fairness and liberality.
1Sa 31:1-7	<br>We cannot judge of the spiritual or eternal state of any by the mannerof their death; for in that, there is one event to the righteous and tothe wicked. Saul, when sorely wounded, and unable to resist or to flee,expressed no concern about his never-dying soul; but only desired thatthe Philistines might not insult over him, or put him to pain, and hebecame his own murderer. As it is the grand deceit of the devil, topersuade sinners, under great difficulties, to fly to this last act ofdesperation, it is well to fortify the mind against it, by a seriousconsideration of its sinfulness before God, and its miserableconsequences in society. But our security is not in ourselves. Let usseek protection from Him who keepeth Israel. Let us watch and pray; andtake unto us the whole armour of God, that we may be able to withstandin the evil day, and having done all, to stand.
1Sa 31:8-13	<br>The Scripture makes no mention what became of the souls of Saul and hissons, after they were dead; but of their bodies only: secret thingsbelong not to us. It is of little consequence by what means we die, orwhat is done with our dead bodies. If our souls are saved, our bodieswill be raised incorruptible and glorious; but not to fear His wrath,who is able to destroy both body and soul in hell, is the extreme offolly and wickedness. How useless is the respect of fellow-creatures tothose who are suffering the wrath of God! While pompous funerals, grandmonuments, and he praises of men, honour the memory of the deceased,the soul may be suffering in the regions of darkness and despair! Letus seek that honour which cometh from God only.
2Sa 1:1-10	<br>The blow which opened David's way to the throne was given about thetime he had been sorely distressed. Those who commit their concerns tothe Lord, will quietly abide his will. It shows that he desired notSaul's death, and he was not impatient to come to the throne.
2Sa 1:11-16	<br>David was sincere in his mourning for Saul; and all with him humbledthemselves under the hand of God, laid so heavily upon Israel by thisdefeat. The man who brought the tidings, David put to death, as amurderer of his prince. David herein did not do unjustly; the Amalekiteconfessed the crime. If he did as he said, he deserved to die fortreason; and his lying to David, if indeed it were a lie, proved, assooner or later that sin will prove, lying against himself. HerebyDavid showed himself zealous for public justice, without regard to hisown private interest.
2Sa 1:17-27	<br>Kasheth, or "the bow," probably was the title of this mournful, funeralsong. David does not commend Saul for what he was not; and says nothingof his piety or goodness. Jonathan was a dutiful son, Saul anaffectionate father, therefore dear to each other. David had reason tosay, that Jonathan's love to him was wonderful. Next to the lovebetween Christ and his people, that affection which springs form it,produces the strongest friendship. The trouble of the Lord's people,and triumphs of his enemies, will always grieve true believers,whatever advantages they may obtain by them.
2Sa 2:1-7	<br>After the death of Saul, many went to David at Ziklag, 1Ch 12:22, buthe trusted in God who promised him the kingdom, to give it in his owntime and manner. Yet assurance of hope in God's promise, will quickenpious endeavours. If I be chosen to the crown of life, it does notfollow, Then I will do nothing; but, Then I will do all that Goddirects me. This good use David made of his election, and so will allwhom God has chosen. In all our journeys and removes, it is comfortableto see God going before us; and we may do so, if by faith and prayer weset Him before us. God, according to the promise, directed David'spath. David rose gradually: thus the kingdom of the Messiah, the Son ofDavid, is set up by degrees; he is Lord of all, but we see not yet allthings put under him.
2Sa 2:8-17	<br>The nation in general refused David. By this the Lord trained up hisservant for future honour and usefulness; and the tendency of truegodliness was shown in his behaviour while passing through variousdifficulties. David was herein a type of Christ, whom Israel would notsubmit to, though anointed of the Father to be a Prince and a Saviourto them. Abner meant, Let the young men fight before us, when he said,Let them play before us: fools thus make a mock at sin. But he isunworthy the name of a man, that can thus trifle with human blood.
2Sa 2:18-24	<br>Death often comes by ways we least suspect. We are often betrayed bythe accomplishments we are proud of! Asahel's swiftness, which hepresumed so much upon, did him no service, but hastened his end.
2Sa 2:25-32	<br>Abner appeals to Joab concerning the miserable consequences of a civilwar. Those who make light of such unnatural contests, will find thatthey are bitterness to all concerned. How easy it is for men to usereason, when it makes for them, who would not use it, if it madeagainst them! See how the issue of things alter men's minds! The samething which looked pleasant in the morning, at night looked dismal.Those who are most forward to enter into contention, will repent beforethey have done with it, and had better leave it off before it bemeddled with, as Solomon advises. This is true of every sin, oh thatmen would consider it in time, that it will be bitterness in the latterend! Asahel's funeral is here mentioned. Distinctions are made betweenthe dust of some and that of others; but in the resurrection nodifference will be made, but between the godly and ungodly, which willremain for ever.
2Sa 3:1-6	<br>The length of this war tried the faith and patience of David, and madehis settlement at last the more welcome. The contest between grace andcorruption in the hearts of believers, may fitly be compared to thiswarfare. There is a long war between them, the flesh lusting againstthe spirit, and the spirit against the flesh; but as the work ofholiness is carried on, corruption, like the house of Saul, growsweaker and weaker; while grace, like the house of David, grows strongerand stronger.
2Sa 3:7-21	<br>Many, like Abner, are not above committing base crimes, who are tooproud to bear reproof, or even the suspicion of being guilty. While mengo on in sin, and apparently without concern, they are often consciousthat they are fighting against God. Many mean to serve their ownpurposes; and will betray those who trust them, when they can get anyadvantage. Yet the Lord serves his own designs, even by those who arethus actuated by revenge, ambition, or lust; but as they intend not tohonour him, in the end they will be thrown aside with contempt. Therewas real generosity both to Michal and to the memory of Saul, inDavid's receiving the former, remembering probably how once he owed hislife to her affection, and knowing that she was separated from himpartly by her father's authority. Let no man set his heart on thatwhich he is not entitled to. If any disagreement has separated husbandand wife, as they expect the blessing of God, let them be reconciled,and live together in love.
2Sa 3:22-39	<br>Judgments are prepared for such scorners as Abner; but Joab, in what hedid, acted wickedly. David laid Abner's murder deeply to heart, and inmany ways expressed his detestation of it. The guilt of blood brings acurse upon families: if men do not avenge it, God will. It is a sadthing to die like a fool, as they do that any way shorten their owndays, and those who make no provision for another world. Who would befond of power, when a man may have the name of it, and must beaccountable for it, yet is hampered in the use of it? David ought tohave done his duty, and then trusted God with the issue. Carnal policyspared Joab. The Son of David may long delay, but never fails to punishimpenitent sinners. He who now reigns upon the throne of David, has akingdom of a nobler kind. Whatever He doeth, is noticed by all hiswilling people, and is pleasing to them.
2Sa 4:1-7	<br>See how Ishbosheth was murdered! When those difficulties dispirit us,which should sharpen our endeavours, we betray both our heavenly crownsand our earthly lives. Love not sleep, lest thou come to poverty andruin. The idle soul is an easy prey to the destroyer. We know not whenand where death will meet us. When we lie down to sleep, we are notsure that we may not sleep the sleep of death before we awake; nor dowe know from what hand the death-blow may come.
2Sa 4:8-12	<br>A person may be glad to obtain his just wishes, and yet really regretthe means by which he receives them. He may be sorry for the death of aperson by which he is a gainer. These men shed innocent blood, from thebasest motives. David justly executed vengeance upon them. He would notbe beholden to any to help him by unlawful practices. God had helpedhim over many a difficulty, and through many a danger, therefore hedepended upon him to crown and complete his own work. He speaks of hisredemption from all adversity, as a thing done; though he had manystorms yet before him, he knew that He who had delivered, woulddeliver.
2Sa 5:1-5	<br>David was anointed king a third time. His advances were gradual, thathis faith might be tried, and that he might gain experience. Thus hiskingdom typified that of the Messiah, which was to come to its heightby degrees. Thus Jesus became our Brother, took upon him our nature,dwelt in it that he might become our Prince and Saviour: thus thehumbled sinner takes encouragement from the endearing relation, appliesfor his salvation, submits to his authority, and craves his protection.
2Sa 5:6-10	<br>The enemies of God's people are often very confident of their ownstrength, and most secure when their day to fall draws nigh. But thepride and insolence of the Jebusites animated David, and the Lord Godof hosts was with him. Thus in the day of God's power, Satan'sstrong-hold, the human heart, is changed into a habitation of Godthrough the Spirit, and into a throne on which the Son of David rules,and brings every thought into obedience to himself. May He thus come,and claim, and cleanse, each of our hearts; and, destroying every idol,may he reign there for ever!
2Sa 5:11-16	<br>David's house was not the worse, nor the less fit to be dedicated toGod, for being built by the sons of the stranger. It is prophesied ofthe gospel church, The sons of strangers shall build up thy walls, andtheir kings shall minister unto thee, Isa 60:10. David's government wasrooted and built up. David was established king; so is the Son ofDavid, and all who, through him, are made to our God kings and priests.Never had the nation of Israel appeared so great as it began now to be.Many have the favour and love of God, yet do not perceive it, and sowant the comfort of it; but to be exalted to that, and to perceive it,is happiness. David owned it was for his people's sake God had donegreat things for him; that he might be a blessing to them, and thatthey might be happy under him.
2Sa 5:17-25	<br>The Philistines considered not that David had the presence of God withhim, which Saul had forfeited and lost. The kingdom of the Messiah, assoon as it was set up in the world, was thus attacked by the powers ofdarkness. The heathen raged, and the kings of the earth set themselvesto oppose it; but all in vain, Ps 2:1, &c. The destruction will turn,as this did, upon Satan's own kingdom. David owns dependence on God forvictory; and refers himself to the good pleasure of God, Wilt thou doit? The assurance God has given us of victory over our spiritualenemies, should encourage us in our spiritual conflicts. David waitedtill God moved; he stirred then, but not till then. He was trained upin dependence on God and his providence. God performed his promise, andDavid failed not to improve his advantages. When the kingdom of theMessiah was to be set up, the apostles, who were to beat down thedevil's kingdom, must not attempt any thing till they received thepromise of the Spirit; who came with a sound from heaven, as of arushing, mighty wind, Ac 2:2.
2Sa 6:1-5	<br>God is present with the souls of his people, when they want the outwardtokens of his presence; but now David is settled in the throne, thehonour of the ark begins to revive. Let us learn hence, to think and tospeak highly of God; and to think and speak honourably of holyordinances, which are to us as the ark was unto Israel, the tokens ofGod's presence, Mt 28:20. Christ is our Ark; in and by him Godmanifests his favour, and accepts our prayers and praises. The arkespecially typified Christ and his mediation, in which the name ofJehovah and all his glories are displayed. The priests should havecarried the ark upon their shoulders. Philistines may carry the ark ina cart without suffering for it; but if Israelites do so, it is attheir peril, because this was not what God appointed.
2Sa 6:6-11	<br>Uzzah was struck dead for touching the ark. God saw presumption andirreverence in Uzzah's heart. Familiarity, even with that which is mostawful, is apt to breed contempt. If it were so great a crime for one tolay hold on the ark of the covenant who had no right to do so, what isit for those to lay claim to the privileges of the covenant that comenot up to the terms of it? Obed-edom opened his doors without fear,knowing the ark was a savour of death unto death to those only whotreated it wrong. The same hand that punished Uzzah's proudpresumption, rewarded Obed-edom's humble boldness. Let none think theworse of the gospel for the judgments on those that reject it, butconsider the blessings it brings to all who receive it. Let masters offamilies be encouraged to keep up religion in their families. It isgood to live in a family that entertains the ark, for all about it willfare the better.
2Sa 6:12-19	<br>It became evident, that happy was the man who had the ark near him.Christ is indeed a Stone of stumbling, and a Rock of offence, to thosethat are disobedient; but to those that believe, he is a Corner-stone,elect, precious, 1Pe 2:6-8. Let us be religious. Is the ark a blessingto others' houses? We may have it, and the blessing of it, withoutfetching it away from our neighbours. David, at first setting out,offered sacrifices to God. We are likely to speed in our enterprises,when we begin with God, and give diligence to seek peace with him. Andwe are so unworthy, and our services are so defiled, that all our joyin God must be connected with repentance and faith in the Redeemer'satoning blood. David attended with high expressions of joy. We ought toserve God with our whole body and soul, and with every endowment andpower we possess. On this occasion David laid aside his royal robes,and put on a plain linen dress. David prayed with and for the people,and as a prophet, solemnly blessed them in the name of the Lord.
2Sa 6:20-23	<br>David returned to bless his household, to pray with them, and for them,and to offer up family thanksgiving for this national mercy. It isangels' work to worship God, surely that cannot lower the greatest ofmen. But even the palaces of princes are not free from family troubles.Exercises of religion appear mean in the eyes of those who have littleor no religion themselves. If we can approve ourselves to God in whatwe do in religion, and do it as before the Lord, we need not heedreproach. Piety will have its praise: let us not be indifferent in it,nor afraid or ashamed to own it. David was contented to justifyhimself, and he did not further reprove or blame Michal's insolence;but God punished her. Those that honour God, he will honour; but thosethat despise him, and his servants and service, shall be lightlyesteemed.
2Sa 7:1-3	<br>David being at rest in his palace, considered how he might best employhis leisure and prosperity in the service of God. He formed a design tobuild a temple for the ark. Nathan here did not speak as a prophet, butas a godly man, encouraging David by his private judgment. We ought todo all we can to encourage and promote the good purposes and designs ofothers, and, as we have opportunity, to forward a good work.
2Sa 7:4-17	<br>Blessings are promised to the family and posterity of David. Thesepromises relate to Solomon, David's immediate successor, and the royalline of Judah. But they also relate to Christ, who is often calledDavid and the Son of David. To him God gave all power in heaven andearth, with authority to execute judgment. He was to build the gospeltemple, a house for God's name; the spiritual temple of true believers,to be a habitation of God through the Spirit. The establishing of hishouse, his throne, and his kingdom for ever, can be applied to no otherthan to Christ and his kingdom: David's house and kingdom long sincecame to an end. The committing iniquity cannot be applied to theMessiah himself, but to his spiritual seed; true believers haveinfirmities, for which they must expect to be corrected, though theyare not cast off.
2Sa 7:18-29	<br>David's prayer is full of the breathings of devout affection towardGod. He had low thoughts of his own merits. All we have, must be lookedupon as Divine gifts. He speaks very highly and honourably of theLord's favours to him. Considering what the character and condition ofman is, we may be amazed that God should deal with him as he does. Thepromise of Christ includes all; if the Lord God be ours, what more canwe ask, or think of? Eph 3:20. He knows us better than we knowourselves; therefore let us be satisfied with what he has done for us.What can we say more for ourselves in our prayers, than God has saidfor us in his promises? David ascribes all to the free grace of God.Both the great things He had done for him, and the great things He hadmade known to him. All was for his word's sake, that is, for the sakeof Christ the eternal Word. Many, when they go to pray, have theirhearts to seek, but David's heart was found, that is, it was fixed;gathered in from its wanderings, entirely engaged to the duty, andemployed in it. That prayer which is from the tongue only, will notplease God; it must be found in the heart; that must be lifted up andpoured out before God. He builds his faith, and hopes to speed, uponthe sureness of God's promise. David prays for the performance of thepromise. With God, saying and doing are not two things, as they oftenare with men; God will do as he hath said. The promises of God are notmade to us by name, as to David, but they belong to all who believe inJesus Christ, and plead them in his name.
2Sa 8:1-8	<br>David subdued the Philistines. They had long been troublesome toIsrael. And after the long and frequent struggles the saints have withthe powers of darkness, like Israel with the Philistines, the Son ofDavid shall tread them all under foot, and make the saints more thanconquerors. He smote the Moabites, and made them tributaries to Israel.Two parts he destroyed, the third part he spared. The line that was tokeep alive, though it was but one, is ordered to be a full line. Letthe line of mercy be stretched to the utmost. He smote the Syrians. Inall these wars David was protected, for this in his psalms he oftengives glory to God.
2Sa 8:9-14	<br>All the precious things David was master of, were dedicated things;they were designed for building the temple. The idols of gold Daviddestroyed, 2Sa 5:21, but the vessels of gold he dedicated. Thus, in theconquest of a soul by the grace of the Son of David, what stands inopposition to God must be destroyed, every lust must be mortified andcrucified, but what may glorify him must be dedicated; thus theproperty of it is altered. God employs his servants in various ways;some, as David, in spiritual battles; others, as Solomon, in spiritualbuildings; and one prepares work for the other, that God may have theglory of all.
2Sa 8:15-18	<br>David neither did wrong, nor denied or delayed right to any. Thisspeaks his close application to business; also his readiness to admitall addresses and appeals made to him. He had no respect of persons injudgment. Herein he was a type of Christ. To Him let us submit, hisfriendship let us seek, his service let us count our pleasure,diligently attending to the work he assigns to each of us. David madehis sons chief rulers; but all believers, Christ's spiritual seed, arebetter preferred, for they are made kings and priests to our God, Re1:6.
2Sa 9:1-8	<br>Amidst numerous affairs we are apt to forget the gratitude we owe, andthe engagements we are under, not only to our friends, but to Godhimself. Yet persons of real godliness will have no rest till they havedischarged them. And the most proper objects of kindness and charity,frequently will not be found without inquiry. Jonathan was David'ssworn friend, therefore he shows kindness to his son Mephibosheth. Godis faithful to us; let us not be unfaithful to one another. IfProvidence has raised us, and our friends and their families arebrought low, we must look upon that as giving us the fairer opportunityof being kind to them.
2Sa 9:9-13	<br>As David was a type of Christ, his Lord and Son, his Root andOffspring, let his kindness to Mephibosheth remind us of the kindnessand love of God our Saviour to fallen man, to whom he was under noobligation, as David was to Jonathan. The Son of God seeks this lostand ruined race, who sought not after him. He comes to seek and to savethem!
2Sa 10:1-5	<br>Nahash had been an enemy to Israel, yet had showed kindness to David.David therefore resolves gratefully to return it. If a Pharisee givesalms in pride, though God will not reward it, yet he that receives thealms ought to return thanks for it. Those who bear ill-will to theirneighbours, are resolved not to believe that their neighbours bear anygood-will to them. There is nothing so well meant, but it may be illinterpreted, and is wont to be so, by men who love nobody butthemselves. The best men must not think it strange if they are thusmisrepresented. Charity thinketh no evil. According to the usages ofthose days and countries, Hanun treated David's ambassadors in the mostcontemptuous manner. David showed much concern for his servants. Let uslearn not to lay unjust reproaches to heart; they will wear off, andturn only to the shame of those who utter or do them; while thereputation wrongfully hurt in a little time grows again, as thesebeards did. God will bring forth thy righteousness as the light,therefore wait patiently for him, Ps 37:6,7.
2Sa 10:6-14	<br>They that are at war with the Son of David, not only give theprovocation, but begin the war. God has forces to send against thosethat set his wrath at defiance, Isa 5:19, which will convince them thatnone ever hardened his heart against God, and prospered. Christ'ssoldiers should strengthen one another's hands in their spiritualwarfare. Let nothing be wanting in us, whatever the success be. When wemake conscience of doing our duty, we may, with satisfaction, leave theevent with God, assuredly hoping for his salvation in his own way andtime.
2Sa 10:15-19	<br>Here is a new attempt of the Syrians. Even the baffled cause will makehead as long as there is any life in it; the enemies of the Son ofDavid do so. But now the promise made to Abraham, Ge 15:18, andrepeated to Joshua, Jos 1:4, that the borders of Israel should extendto the river Euphrates, was performed. Learn hence, that it isdangerous to help those who have God against them; for when they fall,their helpers will fall with them.
2Sa 11:1-5	<br>Observe the occasions of David's sin; what led to it. 1. Neglect of hisbusiness. He tarried at Jerusalem. When we are out of the way of ourduty, we are in temptation. 2. Love of ease: idleness gives greatadvantage to the tempter. 3. A wandering eye. He had not, like Job,made a covenant with his eyes, or, at this time, he had forgotten it.And observe the steps of the sin. See how the way of sin is down-hill;when men begin to do evil, they cannot soon stop. Observe theaggravations of the sin. How could David rebuke or punish that inothers, of which he was conscious that he himself was guilty?
2Sa 11:6-13	<br>Giving way to sin hardens the heart, and provokes the departure of theHoly Spirit. Robbing a man of his reason, is worse than robbing him ofhis money; and drawing him into sin, is worse than drawing him into anywordly trouble whatever.
2Sa 11:14-27	<br>Adulteries often occasion murders, and one wickedness is sought to becovered by another. The beginnings of sin are much to be dreaded; forwho knows where they will end? Can a real believer ever tread thispath? Can such a person be indeed a child of God? Though grace be notlost in such an awful case, the assurance and consolation of it must besuspended. All David's life, spirituality, and comfort in religion, wemay be sure were lost. No man in such a case can have evidence to besatisfied that he is a believer. The higher a man's confidence is, whohas sunk in wickedness, the greater his presumption and hypocrisy. Letnot any one who resembles David in nothing but his transgressions,bolster up his confidence with this example. Let him follow David inhis humiliation, repentance, and his other eminent graces, before hethinks himself only a backslider, and not a hypocrite. Let no opposerof the truth say, These are the fruits of faith! No; they are theeffects of corrupt nature. Let us all watch against the beginnings ofself-indulgence, and keep at the utmost distance from all evil. Butwith the Lord there is mercy and plenteous redemption. He will cast outno humble, penitent believer; nor will he suffer Satan to pluck hissheep out of his hand. Yet the Lord will recover his people, in such away as will mark his abhorrence of their crimes, to hinder all whoregard his word from abusing the encouragements of his mercy.
2Sa 12:1-14	<br>God will not suffer his people to lie still in sin. By this parableNathan drew from David a sentence against himself. Great need there isof prudence in giving reproofs. In his application, he was faithful. Hesays in plain terms, Thou art the man. God shows how much he hates sin,even in his own people; and wherever he finds it, he will not let it gounpunished. David says not a word to excuse himself or make light ofhis sin, but freely owns it. When David said, I have sinned, and Nathanperceived that he was a true penitent, he assured him his sin wasforgiven. Thou shalt not die: that is, not die eternally, nor be forever put away from God, as thou wouldest have been, if thou hadst notput away the sin. Though thou shalt all thy days be chastened of theLord, yet thou shalt not be condemned with the world. There is thisgreat evil in the sins of those who profess religion and relation toGod, that they furnish the enemies of God and religion with matter forreproach and blasphemy. And it appears from David's case, that evenwhere pardon is obtained, the Lord will visit the transgression of hispeople with the rod, and their iniquity with stripes. For one momentarygratification of a vile lust, David had to endure many days and yearsof extreme distress.
2Sa 12:15-25	<br>David now penned the 51st Psalm, in which, though he had been assuredthat his sin was pardoned, he prays earnestly for pardon, and greatlylaments his sin. He was willing to bear the shame of it, to have itever before him, to be continually upbraided with it. God gives usleave to be earnest with him in prayer for particular blessings, fromtrust in his power and general mercy, though we have no particularpromise to build upon. David patiently submitted to the will of God inthe death of one child, and God made up the loss to his advantage, inthe birth of another. The way to have creature comforts continued orrestored, or the loss made up some other way, is cheerfully to resignthem to God. God, by his grace, particularly owned and favoured thatson, and ordered him to be called Jedidiah, Beloved of the Lord. Ourprayers for our children are graciously and as fully answered when someof them die in their infancy, for they are well taken care of, and whenothers live, "beloved of the Lord."
2Sa 12:26-31	<br>To be thus severe in putting the children of Ammon to slavery was asign that David's heart was not yet made soft by repentance, at thetime when this took place. We shall be most compassionate, kind, andforgiving to others, when we most feel our need of the Lord's forgivinglove, and taste the sweetness of it in our own souls.
2Sa 13:1-20	<br>From henceforward David was followed with one trouble after another.Adultery and murder were David's sins, the like sins among his childrenwere the beginnings of his punishment: he was too indulgent to hischildren. Thus David might trace the sins of his children to his ownmisconduct, which must have made the anguish of the chastisement worse.Let no one ever expect good treatment from those who are capable ofattempting their seduction; but it is better to suffer the greatestwrong than to commit the least sin.
2Sa 13:21-29	<br>Observe the aggravations of Absalom's sin: he would have Ammon slain,when least fit to go out of the world. He engaged his servants in theguilt. Those servants are ill-taught who obey wicked masters, againstGod's commands. Indulged children always prove crosses to godlyparents, whose foolish love leads them to neglect their duty to God.
2Sa 13:30-39	<br>Jonadab was as guilty of Ammon's death, as of his sin; such falsefriends do they prove, who counsel us to do wickedly. Instead ofloathing Absalom as a murderer, David, after a time, longed to go forthto him. This was David's infirmity: God saw something in his heart thatmade a difference, else we should have thought that he, as much as Eli,honoured his sons more than God.
2Sa 14:1-20	<br>We may notice here, how this widow pleads God's mercy, and his clemencytoward poor guilty sinners. The state of sinners is a state ofbanishment from God. God pardons none to the dishonour of his law andjustice, nor any who are impenitent; nor to the encouragement ofcrimes, or the hurt of others.
2Sa 14:21-24	<br>David was inclined to favour Absalom, yet, for the honour of hisjustice, he could not do it but upon application made for him, whichmay show the methods of Divine grace. It is true that God has thoughtsof compassion toward poor sinners, not willing that any should perish;yet he is only reconciled to them through a Mediator, who pleads ontheir behalf. God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself, andChrist came to this land of our banishment, to bring us to God.
2Sa 14:25-27	<br>Nothing is said of Absalom's wisdom and piety. All here said of him is,that he was very handsome. A poor commendation for a man that hadnothing else in him valuable. Many a polluted, deformed soul dwells ina fair and comely body. And we read that he had a very fine head ofhair. It was a burden to him, but he would not cut it as long as hecould bear the weight. That which feeds and gratifies pride, is notcomplained of, though uneasy. May the Lord grant us the beauty ofholiness, and the adorning of a meek and quiet spirit! Only those whofear God are truly happy.
2Sa 14:28-33	<br>By his insolent carriage toward Joab, Absalom brought Joab to plead forhim. By his insolent message to the king, he gained his wishes. Whenparents and rulers countenance such characters, they will soon sufferthe most fatal effects. But did the compassion of a father prevail toreconcile him to an impenitent son, and shall penitent sinners questionthe compassion of Him who is the Father of mercies?
2Sa 15:1-6	<br>David allows Absalom's pomp. Those parents know not what they do, whoindulge a proud humour in their children: many young people are ruinedby pride. And those commonly are most eager for authority who leastunderstand its duties.
2Sa 15:7-12	<br>See how willing tender parents are to believe the best concerning theirchildren. But how easy and how wicked is it, for children to takeadvantage of good parents, and to deceive them with the show ofreligion! The principal men of Jerusalem joined Absalom's feast uponhis sacrifice. Pious persons are glad to see others appear religious,and this gives occasion for deceptions. The policy of wicked men, andthe subtlety of Satan, are exerted to draw good persons to countenancebase designs.
2Sa 15:13-23	<br>David determined to quit Jerusalem. He took this resolve, as a penitentsubmitting to the rod. Before unrighteous Absalom he could justifyhimself, and stand out; but before the righteous God he must condemnhimself, and yield to his judgments. Thus he accepts the punishment ofhis sin. And good men, when they themselves suffer, are anxious thatothers should not be led to suffer with them. He compelled none; thosewhose hearts were with Absalom, to Absalom let them go, and so shalltheir doom be. Thus Christ enlists none but willing followers. Davidcannot bear to think that Ittai, a stranger and an exile, a proselyteand a new convert, who ought to be encouraged and made easy, shouldmeet with hard usage. But such value has Ittai for David's wisdom andgoodness, that he will not leave him. He is a friend indeed, who lovesat all times, and will adhere to us in adversity. Let us cleave to theSon of David, with full purpose of heart, and neither life nor deathshall separate us from his love.
2Sa 15:24-30	<br>David is very careful for the safety of the ark. It is right to be moreconcerned for the church's prosperity than our own; to prefer thesuccess of the gospel above our own wealth, credit, ease, and safety.Observe with what satisfaction and submission David speaks of theDivine disposal. It is our interest, as well as our duty, cheerfully toacquiesce in the will of God, whatever befalls us. Let us see God'shand in all events; and that we may not be afraid of what shall be, letus see all events in God's hand. David's sin was ever before him, Ps51:3; but never so plain, nor ever appearing so black as now. He neverwept thus when Saul hunted him, but a wounded conscience makes troubleslie heavy, Ps 38:4.
2Sa 15:31-37	<br>David prays not against Ahithophel's person, but against his counsel.He prayed this, in firm belief that God has all hearts in his hand, andtongues also. But we must second our prayers with endeavours, and Daviddid so, else we tempt God. But we do not find wisdom and simplicity sounited in any mere man, that we can perceive nothing which needsforgiveness. Yet, when the Son of David was treated with all possibletreachery and cruelty, his wisdom, meekness, candour, and patience,were perfect. Him let us follow, cleave to, and serve, in life and indeath.
2Sa 16:1-4	<br>Ziba belied Mephibosheth. Great men ought always to be jealous offlatterers, and to be careful that they hear both sides.
2Sa 16:5-14	<br>David bore Shimei's curses much better than Ziba's flatteries; by thesehe was brought to pass a wrong judgment on another, by those to pass aright judgment on himself: the world's smiles are more dangerous thanits frowns. Once and again David spared Saul's life, while Saul soughthis. But innocence is no defence against malice and falsehood; nor arewe to think it strange, if we are charged with that which we have beenmost careful to keep ourselves from. It is well for us, that men arenot to be our judges, but He whose judgment is according to truth. Seehow patient David was under this abuse. Let this remind us of Christ,who prayed for those who reviled and crucified him. A humble spiritwill turn reproaches into reproofs, and get good from them, instead ofbeing provoked by them. David the hand of God in it, and comfortshimself that God would bring good out of his affliction. We may dependupon God to repay, not only our services, but our sufferings.
2Sa 16:15-23	<br>The wisest counsellors of that age were Ahithophel and Hushai: Absalomthinks himself sure of success, when he has both; on them he relies,and consults not the ark, though he had that with him. But miserablecounsellors were they both. Hushai would never counsel him to dowisely. Ahithophel counselled him to do wickedly; and so did aseffectually betray him, as he did, who was designedly false to him: forthey that advise men to sin, certainly advise them to their hurt. Afterall, honesty is the best policy, and will be found so in the long run.Ahithophel gave wicked counsel to Absalom; to render himself so hatefulto his father, that he would never be reconciled to him; this cursedpolicy was of the devil. How desperately wicked is the human heart!
2Sa 17:1-21	<br>Here was a wonderful effect of Divine Providence blinding Absalom'smind and influencing his heart, that he could not rest in Ahithophel'scounsel, and that he should desire Hushai's advice. But there is nocontending with that God who can arm a man against himself, and destroyhim by his own mistakes and passions. Ahithophel's former counsel wasfollowed, for God intended to correct David; but his latter counsel wasnot followed, for God meant not to destroy him. He can overrule allcounsels. Whatever wisdom or help any man employs or affords, thesuccess is from God alone, who will not let his people perish.
2Sa 17:22-29	<br>Ahithophel hanged himself for vexation that his counsel was notfollowed. That will break a proud man's heart which will not break ahumble man's sleep. He thought himself in danger, concluding, that,because his counsel was not followed, Absalom's cause would fail; andto prevent a possible public execution, he does justice upon himself.Thus the breath is stopped, and the head laid low, from which nothingcould be expected but mischief. Absalom chased his father. But observehow God sometimes makes up to his people that comfort from strangers,which they are disappointed of in their own families. Our King needsnot our help; but he assures us, that what we do for the least of hisbrethren, who are sick, poor, and destitute, shall be accepted andrecompensed as if done to himself
2Sa 18:1-8	<br>How does David render good for evil! Absalom would have only Davidsmitten; David would have only Absalom spared. This seems to be aresemblance of man's wickedness towards God, and God's mercy to man, ofwhich it is hard to say which is most amazing. Now the Israelites seewhat it is to take counsel against the Lord and his anointed.
2Sa 18:9-18	<br>Let young people look upon Absalom, hanging on a tree, accursed,forsaken of heaven and earth; there let them read the Lord's abhorrenceof rebellion against parents. Nothing can preserve men from misery andcontempt, but heavenly wisdom and the grace of God.
2Sa 18:19-33	<br>By directing David to give God thanks for his victory, Ahimaaz preparedhim for the news of his son's death. The more our hearts are fixed andenlarged, in thanksgiving to God for our mercies, the better disposedwe shall be to bear with patience the afflictions mixed with them. Somethink David's wish arose from concern about Absalom's everlastingstate; but he rather seems to have spoken without due thought. He is tobe blamed for showing so great fondness for a graceless son. Also forquarrelling with Divine justice. And for opposing the justice of thenation, which, as king, he had to administer, and which ought to bepreferred before natural affection. The best men are not always in agood frame; we are apt to over-grieve for what we over-loved. But whilewe learn from this example to watch and pray against sinful indulgence,or neglect of our children, may we not, in David, perceive a shadow ofthe Saviour's love, who wept over, prayed for, and even suffered deathfor mankind, though vile rebels and enemies.
2Sa 19:1-8	<br>To continue to lament for so bad a son as Absalom, was very unwise, andvery unworthy. Joab censures David, but not with proper respect anddeference to his sovereign. A plain case may be fairly pleaded withthose above us, and they may be reproved for what they do amiss, but itmust not be with rudeness and insolence. Yet David took the reproof andthe counsel, prudently and mildly. Timely giving way, usually preventsthe ill effects of mistaken measures.
2Sa 19:9-15	<br>God's providence, by the priests' persuasions and Amasa's interest,brought the people to resolve the recall of the king. David stirred nottill he received this invitation. Our Lord Jesus will rule in thosethat invite him to the throne in their hearts, and not till he isinvited. He first bows the heart, and makes it willing in the day ofhis power, then rules in the midst of his enemies, Ps 110:2,3.
2Sa 19:16-23	<br>Those who now slight and abuse the Son of David, would be glad to maketheir peace when he shall come in his glory; but it will be too late.Shimei lost no time. His abuse had been personal, and with the usualright feeling of good men, David could more easily forgive it.
2Sa 19:24-30	<br>David recalls the forfeiture of Mephibosheth's estate; and he expressedjoy for the king's return. A good man contentedly bears his own losses,while he sees Israel in peace, and the Son of David exalted.
2Sa 19:31-39	<br>Barzillai thought he had done himself honour in doing the king anyservice. Thus, when the saints shall be called to inherit the kingdom,they will be amazed at the recompence being so very far beyond theservice, Mt 25:37. A good man would not go any where to be burdensome;or, will rather be so to his own house than to another's. It is goodfor all, but especially becomes old people, to think and speak much ofdying. The grave is ready for me, let me go and get ready for it.
2Sa 19:40-43	<br>The men of Israel though themselves despised, and the fiercer words ofthe men of Judah produced very bad effects. Much evil might be avoided,if men would watch against pride, and remember that a soft answerturneth away wrath. Though we have right and reason on our side, if wespeak it with fierceness, God is displeased.
2Sa 20:1-3	<br>One trial arises after another for our good, till we reach the placewhere sin and sorrow are for ever done away. Angry disputersmisunderstand or misconstrue one another's words; proud men will haveevery thing their own way, or wholly refuse their assistance. Thefavour of the many is not to be depended upon; and what have others toexpect, when Hosanna to the Son of David was soon changed to Crucifyhim, crucify him?
2Sa 20:4-13	<br>Joab barbarously murdered Amasa. The more plot there is in a sin, theworse it is. Joab contentedly sacrificed the interest both of the kingand the kingdom to his personal revenge. But one would wonder with whatface a murderer could pursue a traitor; and how, under such a load ofguilt, he had courage to enter upon danger: his conscience was seared.
2Sa 20:14-22	<br>Justly is that place attacked, which dares to harbour a traitor; norwill the heart fare better which indulges rebellious lusts, that willnot have Christ to reign over them. A discreet woman, by her prudentmanagement, satisfied Joab, and yet saved the city. Wisdom is notconfined to rank or sex; it consists not in deep knowledge; but inunderstanding how to act as matters arise, that troubles may be turnedaway and benefits secured. A great deal of mischief would be prevented,if contending parties would understand one another. Let both sides beundeceived. The single condition of peace is, the surrender of thetraitor. It is so in God's dealing with the soul, when besieged byconviction and distress; sin is the traitor; the beloved lust is therebel: part with that, cast away the transgression, and all shall bewell. There is no peace on any other terms.
2Sa 20:23-26	<br>Here is the state of David's court, after his restoration. It is wellwhen able men are appointed to discharge public duties; let all seek toperform those duties, as faithful servants to the Son of David.
2Sa 21:1-9	<br>Every affliction arises from sin, and should lead us to repent andhumble ourselves before God; but some troubles especially show thatthey are sent to bring sin to remembrance. God's judgments often look agreat way back, which requires us to do so, when we are under hisrebukes. It is not for us to object against the people's smarting forthe sin of their king; perhaps they helped him. Nor against thisgeneration suffering for the sin of the last. God often visits the sinsof the fathers upon the children, and he gives no account of anymatters. Time does not wear out the guilt of sin; nor can we buildhopes of escape upon the delay of judgments. If we cannot understandall the reasons of Providence in this matter, still we have no right todemand that God should acquaint us with those reasons. It must beright, because it is the will of God, and in the end it will be provedto be so. Money is no satisfaction for blood. It should seem, Saul'sposterity trod in his steps, for it is called a bloody house. It wasthe spirit of the family, therefore they are justly reckoned with forhis sin, as well as for their own. The Gibeonites did not require thisout of malice against Saul or his family. It was not to gratify anyrevenge, but for the public good. They were put to death at thebeginning of harvest; they were thus sacrificed to turn away the wrathof Almighty God, who had withheld the harvest-mercies for some yearspast, and to obtain his favour in the present harvest. In vain do weexpect mercy from God, unless we do justice upon our sins. Executionsmust not be thought cruel, which are for the public welfare.
2Sa 21:10-14	<br>That a guilty land should enjoy many years of plenty, calls forgratitude; and we need not wonder misused abundance should be punishedwith scarcity; yet how few are disposed to ask of the Lord concerningthe sinful cause, while numbers search for the second causes by whichhe is pleased to work! But the Lord will plead the cause of those whocannot or will not avenge themselves; and the prayers of the poor areof great power. When God sent rain to water the earth, these bodieswere buried, for then it appeared that God was entreated for the land.When justice is done on earth, vengeance from heaven ceases. God ispacified, and is entreated for us through Christ, who was hanged on atree, and so made a curse for us, to do away our guilt, though he washimself guiltless.
2Sa 21:15-22	<br>These events seem to have taken place towards the end of David's reign.David fainted, but he did not flee, and God sent help in the time ofneed. In spiritual conflicts, even strong saints sometimes wax faint;then Satan attacks them furiously; but those who stand their ground andresist him, shall be relieved and made more than conquerors. Death is aChristian's last enemy, and a son of Anak; but through Him thattriumphed for us, believers shall be more than conquerors at last, evenover that enemy.
2Sa 23:1-7	<br>These words of David are very worthy of regard. Let those who have hadlong experience of God's goodness, and the pleasantness of heavenlywisdom, when they come to finish their course, bear their testimony tothe truth of the promise. David avows his Divine inspiration, that theSpirit of God spake by him. He, and other holy men, spake and wrote asthey were moved by the Holy Ghost. In many things he had his ownneglect and wrong conduct to blame. But David comforted himself thatthe Lord had made with him an everlasting covenant. By this heprincipally intended the covenant of mercy and peace, which the Lordmade with him as a sinner, who believed in the promised Saviour, whoembraced the promised blessing, who yielded up himself to the Lord, tobe his redeemed servant. Believers shall for ever enjoy covenantblessings; and God the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, shall be for everglorified in their salvation. Thus pardon, righteousness, grace, andeternal life, are secured as the gift of God through Jesus Christ.There is an infinite fulness of grace and all blessings treasured up inChrist, for those who seek his salvation. This covenant was all David'ssalvation, he so well knew the holy law of God and the extent of hisown sinfulness, that he perceived what was needful for his own case inthis salvation. It was therefore all his desire. In comparison, allearthly objects lost their attractions; he was willing to give them up,or to die and leave them, that he might enjoy full happiness, Ps73:24-28. Still the power of evil, and the weakness of his faith, hope,and love, were his grief and burden. Doubtless he would have allowedthat his own slackness and want of care were the cause; but the hopethat he should soon be made perfect in glory, encouraged him in hisdying moments.
2Sa 23:8-39	<br>David once earnestly longed for the water at the well of Bethlehem. Itseems to be an instance of weakness. He was thirsty; with the water ofthat well he had often refreshed himself when a youth, and it waswithout due thought that he desired it. Were his valiant men so forwardto expose themselves, upon the least hint of their prince's mind, andso eager to please him, and shall not we long to approve ourselves toour Lord Jesus, by ready compliance with his will, as shown us by hisword, Spirit, and providence? But David poured out the water as adrink-offering to the Lord. Thus he would cross his own foolish fancy,and punish himself for indulging it, and show that he had soberthoughts to correct his rash ones, and knew how to deny himself. DidDavid look upon that water as very precious which was got at the hazardof these men's blood, and shall not we much more value those benefitsfor purchasing which our blessed Saviour shed his blood? Let all bewareof neglecting so great salvation.
2Sa 24:1-9	<br>For the people's sin David was left to act wrong, and in hischastisement they received punishment. This example throws light uponGod's government of the world, and furnishes a useful lesson. The prideof David's heart, was his sin in numbering of the people. He thoughtthereby to appear the more formidable, trusting in an arm of flesh morethan he should have done, and though he had written so much of trustingin God only. God judges not of sin as we do. What appears to usharmless, or, at least, but a small offence, may be a great sin in theeye of God, who discerns the thoughts and intents of the heart. Evenungodly men can discern evil tempers and wrong conduct in believers, ofwhich they themselves often remain unconscious. But God seldom allowsthose whom he loves the pleasures they sinfully covet.
2Sa 24:10-15	<br>It is well, when a man has sinned, if he has a heart within to smitehim for it. If we confess our sins, we may pray in faith that God wouldforgive them, and take away, by pardoning mercy, that sin which we castaway by sincere repentance. What we make the matter of our pride, it isjust in God to take from us, or make bitter to us, and make it ourpunishment. This must be such a punishment as the people have a largeshare in, for though it was David's sin that opened the sluice, thesins of the people all contributed to the flood. In this difficulty,David chose a judgment which came immediately from God, whose mercieshe knew to be very great, rather than from men, who would havetriumphed in the miseries of Israel, and have been thereby hardened intheir idolatry. He chose the pestilence; he and his family would be asmuch exposed to it as the poorest Israelite; and he would continue fora shorter time under the Divine rebuke, however severe it was. Therapid destruction by the pestilence shows how easily God can bring downthe proudest sinners, and how much we owe daily to the Divine patience.
2Sa 24:16,17	<br>Perhaps there was more wickedness, especially more pride, and that wasthe sin now chastised, in Jerusalem than elsewhere, therefore the handof the destroyer is stretched out upon that city; but the Lord repentedhim of the evil, changed not his mind, but his way. In the very placewhere Abraham was stayed from slaying his son, this angel, by a likecountermand, was stayed from destroying Jerusalem. It is for the sakeof the great Sacrifice, that our forfeited lives are preserved from thedestroying angel. And in David is the spirit of a true shepherd of thepeople, offering himself as a sacrifice to God, for the salvation ofhis subjects.
2Sa 24:18-25	<br>God's encouraging us to offer to him spiritual sacrifices, is anevidence of his reconciling us to himself. David purchased the groundto build the altar. God hates robbery for burnt-offering. Those knownot what religion is, who chiefly care to make it cheap and easy tothemselves, and who are best pleased with that which costs them leastpains or money. For what have we our substance, but to honour God withit; and how can it be better bestowed? See the building of the altar,and the offering proper sacrifices upon it. Burnt-offerings to theglory of God's justice; peace-offerings to the glory of his mercy.Christ is our Altar, our Sacrifice; in him alone we may expect toescape his wrath, and to find favour with God. Death is destroying allaround, in so many forms, and so suddenly, that it is madness not toexpect and prepare for the close of life.
1Ki 1:1-4	<br>We have David sinking under infirmities. He was chastised for hisrecent sins, and felt the effects of his former toils and hardships.
1Ki 1:5-10	<br>Indulgent parents are often chastised with disobedient children, whoare anxious to possess their estates. No worldly wisdom, norexperience, nor sacredness of character, can insure the continuance inany former course of those who remain under the power of self-love. Butwe may well wonder by what arts Joab and Abiathar could be drawn aside.
1Ki 1:11-31	<br>Observe Nathan's address to Bathsheba. Let me give thee counsel how tosave thy own life, and the life of thy son. Such as this is the counselChrist's ministers give us in his name, to give all diligence, not onlythat no man take our crown, Re 3:11, but that we save our lives, eventhe lives of our souls. David made a solemn declaration of his firmcleaving to his former resolution, that Solomon should be hissuccessor. Even the recollection of the distresses from which the Lordredeemed him, increased his comfort, inspired his hopes, and animatedhim to his duty, under the decays of nature and the approach of death.
1Ki 1:32-53	<br>The people expressed great joy and satisfaction in the elevation ofSolomon. Every true Israelite rejoices in the exaltation of the Son ofDavid. Combinations formed upon evil principles will soon be dissolved,when self-interest calls another way. How can those who do evil deedsexpect to have good tidings? Adonijah had despised Solomon, but soondreaded him. We see here, as in a glass, Jesus, the Son of David andthe Son of God, exalted to the throne of glory, notwithstanding all hisenemies. His kingdom is far greater than that of his father David, andtherein all the true people of God cordially rejoice. The prosperity ofhis cause is vexation and terror to his enemies. No horns of the altar,nor forms of godliness, nor pretences to religion, can profit those whowill not submit to His authority, and accept of his salvation; and iftheir submission be hypocritical, they shall perish without remedy.
1Ki 2:1-4	<br>David's charge to Solomon is, to keep the charge of the Lord. Theauthority of a dying father is much, but nothing to that of a livingGod. God promised David that the Messiah should come from hisdescendants, and that promise was absolute; but the promise, that thereshould not fail of them a man on the throne of Israel, was conditional;if he walks before God in sincerity, with zeal and resolution: in orderhereunto, he must take heed to his way. (1Ki 2:5-11)
1Ki 2:5-11	<br>These dying counsels concerning Joab and Shimei, did not come frompersonal anger, but for the security of Solomon's throne, which was themurders he had committed, but would readily repeat them to carry anypurpose; though long reprieved, he shall be reckoned with at last. Timedoes not wear out the guilt of any sin, particularly of murder.Concerning Shimei, Hold him not guiltless; do not think him any truefriend to thee, or thy government, or fit to be trusted; he has no lessmalice now than he had then. David's dying sentiments are recorded, asdelivered under the influence of the Holy Ghost, 2Sa 23:1-7. The Lorddiscovered to him the offices and the salvation of that gloriouspersonage, the Messiah, whose coming he then foretold, and from whom hederived all his comforts and expectations. That passage gives a decidedproof that David died under the influence of the Holy Ghost, in theexercise of faith and hope.
1Ki 2:12-25	<br>Solomon received Bathsheba with all the respect that was owing to amother; but let none be asked for that which they ought not to grant.It ill becomes a good man to prefer a bad request, or to appear in abad cause. According to eastern customs it was plain that Adonijahsought to be king, by his asking for Abishag as his wife, and Solomoncould not be safe while he lived. Ambitious, turbulent spirits commonlyprepare death for themselves. Many a head has been lost by catching ata crown.
1Ki 2:26-34	<br>Solomon's words to Abiathar, and his silence, imply that some recentconspiracies had been entered into. Those that show kindness to God'speople shall have it remembered to their advantage. For this reasonSolomon spares Abiathar's life, but dismisses him from his offices. Incase of such sins as the blood of beasts would atone for, the altar wasa refuge, but not in Joab's case. Solomon looks upward to God as theAuthor of peace, and forward to eternity as the perfection of it. TheLord of peace himself gives us that peace which is everlasting.
1Ki 2:35-46	<br>The old malignity remains in the unconverted heart, and a watchful eyeshould be kept on those who, like Shimei, have manifested their enmity,but have given no evidence of repentance. No engagements or dangerswill restrain worldly men; they go on, though they forfeit their livesand souls. Let us remember, God will not accommodate his judgment tous. His eye is over us; and let us strive to walk as in his presence.Let our every act, word, and thought, be governed by this great truth,that the hour is quickly coming when the smallest circumstances of ourlives shall be brought to light, and our eternal state be fixed by arighteous and unerring God. Thus Solomon's throne was established inpeace, as the type of the Redeemer's kingdom of peace andrighteousness. And it is a comfort, in reference to the enmity of thechurch's enemies, that, how much soever they rage, it is a vain thingthey imagine. Christ's throne is established, and they cannot shake it.
1Ki 3:1-4	<br>He that loved the Lord, should, for his sake, have fixed his love uponone of the Lord's people. Solomon was a wise man, a rich man, a greatman; yet the brightest praise of him, is that which is the character ofall the saints, even the poorest, "He loved the Lord." Where God sowsplentifully, he expects to reap accordingly; and those that truly loveGod and his worship, will not grudge the expenses of their religion. Wemust never think that wasted which is laid out in the service of God.
1Ki 3:5-15	<br>Solomon's dream was not a common one. While his bodily powers werelocked up in sleep, the powers of his soul were strengthened; he wasenabled to receive the Divine vision, and to make a suitable choice.God, in like manner, puts us in the ready way to be happy, by assuringus we shall have what we need, and pray for. Solomon's making such achoice when asleep, and the powers of reason least active, showed itcame from the grace of God. Having a humble sense of his own wants andweakness, he pleads, Lord, I am but a little child. The more wise andconsiderate men are, the better acquainted they are with their ownweakness, and the more jealous of themselves. Solomon begs of God togive him wisdom. We must pray for it, Jas 1:5, that it may help us inour particular calling, and the various occasions we have. Those areaccepted of God, who prefer spiritual blessings to earthly good. It wasa prevailing prayer, and prevailed for more than he asked. God gave himwisdom, such as no other prince was ever blessed with; and also gavehim riches and honour. If we make sure of wisdom and grace, these willbring outward prosperity with them, or sweeten the want of it. The wayto get spiritual blessings, is to wrestle with God in prayer for them.The way to get earthly blessings, is to refer ourselves to Godconcerning them. Solomon has wisdom given him, because he did ask it,and wealth, because he did not.
1Ki 3:16-28	<br>An instance of Solomon's wisdom is given. Notice the difficulty of thecase. To find out the true mother, he could not try which the childloved best, and therefore tried which loved the child best: themother's sincerity will be tried, when the child is in danger. Letparents show their love to their children, especially by taking care oftheir souls, and snatching them as brands out of the burning. By thisand other instances of the wisdom with which God endued him, Solomonhad great reputation among his people. This was better to him thanweapons of war; for this he was both feared and loved.
1Ki 4:1-19	<br>In the choice of the great officers of Solomon's court, no doubt, hiswisdom appeared. Several are the same that were in his father's time. Aplan was settled by which no part of the country was exhausted tosupply his court, though each sent its portion.
1Ki 4:20-28	<br>Never did the crown of Israel shine so bright, as when Solomon wore it.He had peace on all sides. Herein, his kingdom was a type of theMessiah's; for to Him it is promised that he shall have the heathen forhis inheritance, and that princes shall worship him. The spiritualpeace, and joy, and holy security, of all the faithful subjects of theLord Jesus, were typified by that of Israel. The kingdom of God is not,as Solomon's was, meat and drink, but, what is infinitely better,righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost. The vast number ofhis attendants, and the great resort to him, are shown by the provisiondaily made. Herein Christ far outdoes Solomon, that he feeds all hissubjects, not with the bread that perishes, but with that which enduresto eternal life.
1Ki 4:29-34	<br>Solomon's wisdom was more his glory than his wealth. He had what ishere called largeness of heart, for the heart is often put for thepowers of the mind. He had the gift of utterance, as well as wisdom. Itis very desirable, that those who have large gifts of any kind, shouldhave large hearts to use them for the good of others. What treasures ofwisdom and knowledge are lost! But every sort of knowledge that isneedful for salvation is to be found in the holy Scriptures. There camepersons from all parts, who were more eager after knowledge than theirneighbours, to hear the wisdom of Solomon. Solomon was herein a type ofChrist, in whom are hid all treasures of wisdom and knowledge; and hidfor us, for he is made of God to us, wisdom. Christ's fame shall spreadthrough all the earth, and men of all nations shall come to him, learnof him, and take upon them his easy yoke, and find rest for theirsouls.
1Ki 5:1-9	<br>Here is Solomon's design to build a temple. There is no adversary, noSatan, so the word is; no instrument of Satan to oppose it, or todivert from it. Satan does all he can, to hinder temple work. Whenthere is no evil abroad, then let us be ready and active in that whichis good, and get forward. Let God's promises quicken our endeavours.And all outward skill and advantages should be made serviceable to theinterests of Christ's kingdom.--If Tyre supplies Israel with craftsmen,Israel will supply Tyre with corn, Eze 27:17. Thus, by the wisedisposal of Providence, one country has need of another, and isbenefitted by another, that there may be dependence on one another, tothe glory of God.
1Ki 5:10-18	<br>The temple was chiefly built by the riches and labour of Gentiles,which typified their being called into the church. Solomon commanded,and they brought costly stones for the foundation. Christ, who is laidfor a Foundation, is a chosen and precious Stone. We should lay ourfoundation firm, and bestow most pains on that part of our religionwhich lies out of the sight of men. And happy those who, as livelystones, are built up a spiritual house, for a habitation of God throughthe Spirit. Who among us will build in the house of the Lord?
1Ki 6:1-10	<br>The temple is called the house of the Lord, because it was directed andmodelled by him, and was to be employed in his service. This gave itthe beauty of holiness, that it was the house of the Lord, which wasfar beyond all other beauties. It was to be the temple of the God ofpeace, therefore no iron tool must be heard; quietness and silence suitand help religious exercises. God's work should be done with much careand little noise. Clamour and violence often hinder, but never furtherthe work of God. Thus the kingdom of God in the heart of man grows upin silence, Mr 5:27.
1Ki 6:11-14	<br>None employ themselves for God, without having his eye upon them. ButGod plainly let Solomon know that all the charge for building thistemple, would neither excuse from obedience to the law of God, norshelter from his judgments, in case of disobedience.
1Ki 6:15-38	<br>See what was typified by this temple. 1. Christ is the true Temple. Inhim dwells all the fulness of the Godhead; in him meet all God'sspiritual Israel; through him we have access with confidence to God. 2.Every believer is a living temple, in whom the Spirit of God dwells,1Co 3:16. This living temple is built upon Christ as its Foundation,and will be perfect in due time. 3. The gospel church is the mysticaltemple. It grows to a holy temple in the Lord, enriched and beautifiedwith the gifts and graces of the Spirit. This temple is built firm,upon a Rock. 4. Heaven is the everlasting temple. There the church willbe fixed. All that shall be stones in that building, must, in thepresent state of preparation, be fitted and made ready for it. Letsinners come to Jesus as the living Foundation, that they may be builton him, a part of this spiritual house, consecrated in body and soul tothe glory of God.
1Ki 7:1-12	<br>All Solomon's buildings, though beautiful, were intended for use.Solomon began with the temple; he built for God first, and then hisother buildings. The surest foundations of lasting prosperity are laidin early piety. He was thirteen years building his house, yet he builtthe temple in little more than seven years; not that he was more exact,but less eager in building his own house, than in building God's. Weought to prefer God's honour before our own ease and satisfaction.
1Ki 7:13-47	<br>The two brazen pillars in the porch of the temple, some think, were toteach those that came to worship, to depend upon God only, for strengthand establishment in all their religious exercises. "Jachin," God willfix this roving mind. It is good that the heart be established withgrace. "Boaz," In him is our strength, who works in us both to will andto do. Spiritual strength and stability are found at the door of God'stemple, where we must wait for the gifts of grace, in use of the meansof grace. Spiritual priests and spiritual sacrifices must be washed inthe laver of Christ's blood, and of regeneration. We must wash often,for we daily contract pollution. There are full means provided for ourcleansing; so that if we have our lot for ever among the unclean itwill be our own fault. Let us bless God for the fountain opened by thesacrifice of Christ for sin and for uncleanness.
1Ki 7:48-51	<br>Christ is now the Temple and the Builder; the Altar and the Sacrifice;the Light of our souls, and the Bread of life; able to supply all thewants of all that have applied or shall apply to him. Outward imagescannot represent, words cannot express, the heart cannot conceive, hispreciousness or his love. Let us come to him, and wash away our sins inhis blood; let us seek for the purifying grace of his Spirit; let usmaintain communion with the Father through his intercession, and yieldup ourselves and all we have to his service. Being strengthened by him,we shall be accepted, useful, and happy.
1Ki 8:1-11	<br>The bringing in the ark, is the end which must crown the work: this wasdone with great solemnity. The ark was fixed in the place appointed forits rest in the inner part of the house, whence they expected God tospeak to them, even in the most holy place. The staves of the ark weredrawn out, so as to direct the high priest to the mercy-seat over theark, when he went in, once a year, to sprinkle the blood there; so thatthey continued of use, though there was no longer occasion to carry itby them. The glory of God appearing in a cloud may signify, 1. Thedarkness of that dispensation, in comparison with the light of thegospel, by which, with open face, we behold, as in a glass, the gloryof the Lord. 2. The darkness of our present state, in comparison withthe sight of God, which will be the happiness of heaven, where theDivine glory is unveiled.
1Ki 8:12-21	<br>Solomon encouraged the priests, who were much astonished at the darkcloud. The dark dispensations of Providence should quicken us infleeing for refuge to the hope of the gospel. Nothing can morereconcile us to them, than to consider what God has said, and tocompare his word and works together. Whatever good we do, we must lookon it as the performance of God's promise to us, not of our promises tohim.
1Ki 8:22-53	<br>In this excellent prayer, Solomon does as we should do in every prayer;he gives glory to God. Fresh experiences of the truth of God's promisescall for larger praises. He sues for grace and favour from God. Theexperiences we have of God's performing his promises, should encourageus to depend upon them, and to plead them with him; and those whoexpect further mercies, must be thankful for former mercies. God'spromises must be the guide of our desires, and the ground of our hopesand expectations in prayer. The sacrifices, the incense, and the wholeservice of the temple, were all typical of the Redeemer's offices,oblation, and intercession. The temple, therefore, was continually tobe remembered. Under one word, "forgive," Solomon expressed all that hecould ask in behalf of his people. For, as all misery springs from sin,forgiveness of sin prepares the way for the removal of every evil, andthe receiving of every good. Without it, no deliverance can prove ablessing. In addition to the teaching of the word of God, Solomonentreated the Lord himself to teach the people to profit by all, evenby their chastisements. They shall know every man the plague of his ownheart, what it is that pains him; and shall spread their hands inprayer toward this house; whether the trouble be of body or mind, theyshall represent it before God. Inward burdens seem especially meant.Sin is the plague of our own hearts; our in-dwelling corruptions areour spiritual diseases: every true Israelite endeavours to know these,that he may mortify them, and watch against the risings of them. Thesedrive him to his knees; lamenting these, he spreads forth his hands inprayer. After many particulars, Solomon concludes with the generalrequest, that God would hearken to his praying people. No place, now,under the gospel, can add to the prayers made in or towards it. Thesubstance is Christ; whatever we ask in his name, it shall be given us.In this manner the Israel of God is established and sanctified, thebackslider is recovered and healed. In this manner the stranger isbrought nigh, the mourner is comforted, the name of God is glorified.Sin is the cause of all our troubles; repentance and forgiveness leadto all human happiness.
1Ki 8:54-61	<br>Never was a congregation dismissed with what was more likely to affectthem, and to abide with them. What Solomon asks for in this prayer, isstill granted in the intercession of Christ, of which his supplicationwas a type. We shall receive grace sufficient, suitable, andseasonable, in every time of need. No human heart is of itself willingto obey the gospel call to repentance, faith, and newness of life,walking in all the commandments of the Lord, yet Solomon exhorts thepeople to be perfect. This is the scriptural method, it is our duty toobey the command of the law and the call of the gospel, seeing we havebroken the law. When our hearts are inclined thereto, feeling oursinfulness and weakness, we pray for Divine assistance; thus are wemade able to serve God through Jesus Christ.
1Ki 8:62-66	<br>Solomon offered a great sacrifice. He kept the feast of tabernacles, asit seems, after the feast of dedication. Thus should we go home,rejoicing, from holy ordinances, thankful for God's Goodness
1Ki 9:1-9	<br>God warned Solomon, now he had newly built and dedicated the temple,that he and his people might not be high-minded, but fear. After allthe services we can perform, we stand upon the same terms with the Lordas before. Nothing can purchase for us liberty to sin, nor would thetrue believer desire such a licence. He would rather be chastened ofthe Lord, than be allowed to go on with ease and prosperity in sin.
1Ki 9:10-14	<br>Solomon gave Hiram twenty cities. Hiram did not like them. If Solomonwould gratify him, let it be in his own element, by becoming hispartner in trade, as he did. See how the providence of God suits thisearth to the various tempers of men, and the dispositions of men to theearth, and all for the good of mankind in general.
1Ki 9:15-28	<br>Here is a further account of Solomon's greatness. He began at the rightend, for he built God's house first, and finished that before he beganhis own; then God blessed him, and he prospered in all his otherbuildings. Let piety begin, and profit follow; leave pleasure to thelast. Whatever pains we take for the glory of God, and to profitothers, we are likely to have the advantage. Canaan, the holy land, theglory of all lands, had no gold in it; which shows that the bestproduce is that which is for the present support of life, our own andothers; such things did Canaan produce. Solomon got much by hismerchandise, and yet has directed us to a better trade, within reach ofthe poorest. Wisdom is better than the merchandise of silver, and thegain thereof than fine gold, Pr 3:14.
1Ki 10:1-13	<br>The queen of Sheba came to Solomon to hear his wisdom, thereby toimprove her own. Our Saviour mentions her inquiries after God, bySolomon, as showing the stupidity of those who inquire not after God,by our Lord Jesus Christ. By waiting and prayer, by diligentlysearching the Scriptures, by consulting wise and experiencedChristians, and by practising what we have learned, we shall bedelivered from difficulties. Solomon's wisdom made more impression uponthe queen of Sheba than all his prosperity and grandeur. There is aspiritual excellence in heavenly things, and in consistent Christians,to which no reports can do justice. Here the truth exceeded; and allwho, through grace, are brought to commune with God, will say the onehalf was not told them of the pleasures and the advantages of wisdom'sways. Glorified saints, much more, will say of heaven, that thethousandth part was not told them, 1Co 2:9. She pronounced them happythat constantly attended Solomon. With much more reason may we say ofChrist's servants, Blessed are they that dwell in his house; they willbe still praising him. She made a noble present to Solomon. What wepresent to Christ, he needs not, but will have us do so to express ourgratitude. The believer who has been with Jesus, will return to hisstation, discharge his duties with readiness, and from better motives;looking forward to the day when, being absent from the body, he shallbe present with the Lord.
1Ki 10:14-29	<br>Solomon increased his wealth. Silver was nothing accounted of. Such isthe nature of worldly wealth, plenty of it makes it the less valuable;much more should the enjoyment of spiritual riches lessen our esteem ofall earthly possessions. If gold in abundance makes silver to bedespised, shall not wisdom, and grace, and the foretastes of heaven,which are far better than gold, make gold to be lightly esteemed? Seein Solomon's greatness the performance of God's promise, and let itencourage us to seek first the righteousness of God's kingdom. This washe, who, having tasted all earthly enjoyments, wrote a book, to showthe vanity of all worldly things, the vexation of spirit that attendsthem, and the folly of setting our hearts upon them: and to recommendserious godliness, as that which will do unspeakably more to make ushappy, that all the wealth and power he was master of; and, through thegrace of God, it is within our reach.
1Ki 11:1-8	<br>There is not a more melancholy and astonishing instance of humandepravity in the sacred Scriptures, than that here recorded. Solomonbecame a public worshipper of abominable idols! Probably he by degreesgave way to pride and luxury, and thus lost his relish for true wisdom.Nothing forms in itself a security against the deceitfulness anddepravity of the human heart. Nor will old age cure the heart of anyevil propensity. If our sinful passions are not crucified and mortifiedby the grace of God, they never will die of themselves, but will lasteven when opportunities to gratify them are taken away. Let him thatthinks he stands, take heed lest he fall. We see how weak we are ofourselves, without the grace of God; let us therefore live in constantdependence on that grace. Let us watch and be sober: ours is adangerous warfare, and in an enemy's country, while our worst foes arethe traitors in our own hearts. (1Ki 11:9-13)
1Ki 11:9-13	<br>The Lord told Solomon, it is likely by a prophet, what he must expectfor his apostacy. Though we have reason to hope that he repented, andfound mercy, yet the Holy Ghost did not expressly record it, but leftit doubtful, as a warning to others not to sin. The guilt may be takenaway, but not the reproach; that will remain. Thus it must remainuncertain to us till the day of judgment, whether or not Solomon wasleft to suffer the everlasting displeasure of an offended God.
1Ki 11:14-25	<br>While Solomon kept close to God and to his duty, there was no enemy togive him uneasiness; but here we have an account of two. If against us,he can make us fear even the least, and the very grasshopper shall be aburden. Though they were moved by principles of ambition or revenge,God used them to correct Solomon.
1Ki 11:26-40	<br>In telling the reason why God rent the kingdom from the house ofSolomon, Ahijah warned Jeroboam to take heed of sinning away hispreferment. Yet the house of David must be supported; out of it theMessiah would arise. Solomon sought to kill his successor. Had not hetaught others, that whatever devices are in men's hearts, the counselof the Lord shall stand? Yet he himself thinks to defeat that counsel.Jeroboam withdrew into Egypt, and was content to live in exile andobscurity for awhile, being sure of a kingdom at last. Shall not we becontent, who have a better kingdom in reserve?
1Ki 11:41-43	<br>Solomon's reign was as long as his father's, but his life was not so.Sin shortened his days. If the world, with all its advantages, couldsatisfy the soul, and afford real joy, Solomon would have found it so.But he was disappointed in all, and to warn us, has left this record ofall earthly enjoyments, "Vanity and vexation of spirit." The NewTestament declares that one greater than Solomon is come to reign overus, and to possess the throne of his father David. May we not seesomething of Christ's excellency faintly represented to us in thisfigure?
1Ki 12:1-15	<br>The tribes complained not to Rehoboam of his father's idolatry, andrevolt from God. That which was the greatest grievance, was none tothem; so careless were they in matters of religion, if they might liveat ease, and pay no taxes. Factious spirits will never want somethingto complain of. And when we see the Scripture account of Solomon'sreign; the peace, wealth, and prosperity Israel then enjoyed; we cannotdoubt but that their charges were false, or far beyond the truth.Rehoboam answered the people according to the counsel of the young men.Never was man more blinded by pride, and desire of arbitrary power,than which nothing is more fatal. God's counsels were hereby fulfilled.He left Rehoboam to his own folly, and hid from his eyes the thingswhich belonged to his peace, that the kingdom might be rent from him.God serves his own wise and righteous purposes by the imprudences andsins of men. Those that lose the kingdom of heaven, throw it away, asRehoboam, by wilfulness and folly.
1Ki 12:16-24	<br>The people speak unbecomingly of David. How soon are good men, andtheir good services to the public, forgotten ! These considerationsshould reconcile us to our losses and troubles, that God is the Authorof them, and our brethren the instruments: let us not meditate revenge.Rehoboam and his people hearkened to the word of the Lord. When we knowGod's mind, we must submit, how much soever it crosses our own mind. Ifwe secure the favour of God, not all the universe can hurt us.
1Ki 12:25-33	<br>Jeroboam distrusted the providence of God; he would contrive ways andmeans, and sinful ones too, for his own safety. A practical disbeliefof God's all-sufficiency is at the bottom of all our departures fromhim. Though it is probable he meant his worship for Jehovah the God ofIsrael, it was contrary to the Divine law, and dishonourable to theDivine majesty to be thus represented. The people might be less shockedat worshipping the God of Israel under an image, than if they had atonce been asked to worship Baal; but it made way for that idolatry.Blessed Lord, give us grace to reverence thy temple, thine ordinances,thine house of prayer, thy sabbaths, and never more, like Jeroboam, toset up in our hearts any idol of abomination. Be thou to us every thingprecious; do thou reign and rule in our hearts, the hope of glory.
1Ki 13:1-10	<br>In threatening the altar, the prophet threatens the founder andworshippers. Idolatrous worship will not continue, but the word of theLord will endure for ever. The prediction plainly declared that thefamily of David would continue, and support true religion, when the tentribes would not be able to resist them. If God, in justice, harden thehearts of sinners, so that the hand they have stretched out in sin theycannot pull in again by repentance, that is a spiritual judgment,represented by this, and much more dreadful. Jeroboam looked for help,not from his calves, but from God only, from his power, and his favour.The time may come when those that hate the preaching, would be glad ofthe prayers of faithful ministers. Jeroboam does not desire the prophetto pray that his sin might be pardoned, and his heart changed, but onlythat his hand might be restored. He seemed affected for the presentwith both the judgment and the mercy, but the impression wore off. Godforbade his messenger to eat or drink in Bethel, to show hisdetestation of their idolatry and apostacy from God, and to teach usnot to have fellowship with the works of darkness. Those have notlearned self-denial, who cannot forbear one forbidden meal.
1Ki 13:11-22	<br>The old prophet's conduct proves that he was not really a godly man.When the change took place under Jeroboam, he preferred his ease andinterest to his religion. He took a very bad method to bring the goodprophet back. It was all a lie. Believers are most in danger of beingdrawn from their duty by plausible pretences of holiness. We may wonderthat the wicked prophet went unpunished, while the holy man of God wassuddenly and severely punished. What shall we make of this? Thejudgments of God are beyond our power to fathom; and there is ajudgment to come. Nothing can excuse any act of wilful disobedience.This shows what they must expect who hearken to the great deceiver.They that yield to him as a tempter, will be terrified by him as atormentor. Those whom he now fawns upon, he will afterwards fly upon;and whom he draws into sin, he will try to drive to despair.
1Ki 13:23-34	<br>God is displeased at the sins of his own people; and no man shall beprotected in disobedience, by his office, his nearness to God, or anyservices he has done for him. God warns all whom he employs, strictlyto observe their orders. We cannot judge of men by their sufferings,nor of sins by present punishments; with some, the flesh is destroyed,that the spirit may be saved; with others, the flesh is pampered, thatthe soul may ripen for hell. Jeroboam returned not from his evil way.He promised himself that the calves would secure the crown to hisfamily, but they lost it, and sunk his family. Those betray themselveswho think to support themselves by any sin whatever. Let us dreadprospering in sinful ways; pray to be kept from every delusion andtemptation, and to be enabled to walk with self-denying perseverance inthe way of God's commands.
1Ki 14:1-6	<br>"At that time," when Jeroboam did evil, his child sickened. Whensickness comes into our families, we should inquire whether there maynot be some particular sin harboured in our houses, which theaffliction is sent to convince us of, and reclaim us from. It had beenmore pious if he had desired to know wherefore God contended with him;had begged the prophet's prayers, and cast away his idols from him; butmost people would rather be told their fortune, than their faults ortheir duty. He sent to Ahijah, because he had told him he should beking. Those who by sin disqualify themselves for comfort, yet expectthat their ministers, because they are good men, should speak peace andcomfort to them, greatly wrong themselves and their ministers. He senthis wife in disguise, that the prophet might only answer her questionconcerning her son. Thus some people would limit their ministers tosmooth things, and care not for having the whole counsel of Goddeclared to them, lest it should prophesy no good concerning them, butevil. But she shall know, at the first word, what she has to trust to.Tidings of a portion with hypocrites will be heavy tidings. God willjudge men according to what they are, not by what they seem to be.
1Ki 14:7-20	<br>Whether we keep an account of God's mercies to us or not, he does; andhe will set them in order before us, if we are ungrateful, to ourgreater confusion. Ahijah foretells the speedy death of the child thensick, in mercy to him. He only in the house of Jeroboam had affectionfor the true worship of God, and disliked the worship of the calves. Toshow the power and sovereignty of his grace, God saves some out of theworst families, in whom there is some good thing towards the Lord Godof Israel. The righteous are removed from the evil to come in thisworld, to the good to come in a better world. It is often a bad signfor a family, when the best in it are buried out of it. Yet their deathnever can be a loss to themselves. It was a present affliction to thefamily and kingdom, by which both ought to have been instructed. Godalso tells the judgments which should come upon the people of Israel,for conforming to the worship Jeroboam established. After they left thehouse of David, the government never continued long in one family, butone undermined and destroyed another. Families and kingdoms are ruinedby sin. If great men do wickedly, they draw many others, both into theguilt and punishment. The condemnation of those will be severest, whomust answer, not only for their own sins, but for sins others have beendrawn into, and kept in, by them.
1Ki 14:21-31	<br>Here is no good said of Rehoboam, and much said to the disadvantage ofhis subjects. The abounding of the worst crimes, of the worst of theheathen, in Jerusalem, the city the Lord had chosen for his temple andhis worship, shows that nothing can mend the hearts of fallen men butthe sanctifying grace of the Holy Spirit. On this alone may we depend;for this let us daily pray, in behalf of ourselves and all around us.The splendour of their temple, the pomp of their priesthood, and allthe advantages with which their religion was attended, could notprevail to keep them close to it; nothing less than the pouring out theSpirit will keep God's Israel in their allegiance to him. Sin exposes,makes poor, and weakens any people. Shishak, king of Egypt, came andtook away the treasures. Sin makes the gold become dim, changes themost fine gold, and turns it into brass.
1Ki 15:1-8	<br>Abijam's heart was not perfect with the Lord his God; he wantedsincerity; he began well, but he fell off, and walked in all the sinsof his father, following his bad example, though he had seen the badconsequences of it. David's family was continued as a lamp inJerusalem, to maintain the true worship of God there, when the light ofDivine truth was extinguished in all other places. The Lord has stilltaken care of his cause, while those who ought to have been serviceablethereto have lived and perished in their sins. The Son of David willstill continue a light to his church, to establish it in truth andrighteousness to the end of time. There are two kinds of fulfilling thelaw, one legal, the other by the gospel. Legal is, when men do allthings required in the law, and that by themselves. None ever thusfulfilled the law but Christ, and Adam before his fall. The gospelmanner of fulfilling the law is, to believe in Christ who fulfilled thelaw for us, and to endeavour in the whole man to obey God in all hisprecepts. And this is accepted of God, as to all those that are inChrist. Thus David and others are said to fulfil the law.
1Ki 15:9-24	<br>Asa did what was right in the eyes of the Lord. That is right indeedwhich is so in God's eyes. Asa's times were times of reformation. Heremoved that which was evil; there reformation begins, and a great dealhe found to do. When Asa found idolatry in the court, he rooted it outthence. Reformation must begin at home. Asa honours and respects hismother; he loves her well, but he loves God better. Those that havepower are happy when thus they have hearts to use it well. We must notonly cease to do evil, but learn to do well; not only cast away theidols of our iniquity, but dedicate ourselves and our all to God'shonour and glory. Asa was cordially devoted to the service of God, hissins not arising from presumption. But his league with Benhadad arosefrom unbelief. Even true believers find it hard, in times of urgentdanger, to trust in the Lord with all their heart. Unbelief makes wayfor carnal policy, and thus for one sin after another. Unbelief hasoften led Christians to call in the help of the Lord's enemies in theircontests with their brethren; and some who once shone brightly, havethus been covered with a dark cloud towards the end of their days.
1Ki 15:25-34	<br>During the single reign of Asa in Judah, the government of Israel wasin six or seven different hands. Observe the ruin of the family ofJeroboam; no word of God shall fall to the ground. Divine threateningsare not designed merely to terrify. Ungodly men execute the justjudgments of God upon each other. But in the midst of dreadful sins andthis apparent confusion, the Lord carries on his own plan: when it isfully completed, the glorious justice, wisdom, truth, and mercy thereindisplayed, shall be admired and adored through all the ages ofeternity.
1Ki 16:1-14	<br>This chapter relates wholly to the kingdom of Israel, and therevolutions of that kingdom. God calls Israel his people still, thoughwretchedly corrupted. Jehu foretells the same destruction to come uponBaasha's family, which that king had been employed to bring upon thefamily of Jeroboam. Those who resemble others in their sins, may expectto resemble them in the plagues they suffer, especially those who seemzealous against such sins in others as they allow in themselves. Baashahimself dies in peace, and is buried with honour. Herein plainlyappears that there are punishments after death, which are most to bedreaded. Let Elah be a warning to drunkards, who know not but death maysurprise them. Death easily comes upon men when they are drunk. Besidesthe diseases which men bring themselves into by drinking, when in thatstate, men are easily overcome by an enemy, and liable to badaccidents. Death comes terribly upon men in such a state, finding themin the act of sin, and unfitted for any act of devotion; that day comesupon them unawares. The word of God was fulfilled, and the sins ofBaasha and Elah were reckoned for, with which they provoked God. Theiridols are called their vanities, for idols cannot profit nor help;miserable are those whose gods are vanities.
1Ki 16:15-28	<br>When men forsake God, they will be left to plague one another. Proudaspiring men ruin one another. Omri struggled with Tibni some years.Though we do not always understand the rules by which God governsnations and individuals in his providence, we may learn useful lessonsfrom the history before us. When tyrants succeed each other, andmassacres, conspiracies, and civil wars, we may be sure the Lord has acontroversy with the people for their sins; they are loudly called torepent and reform. Omri made himself infamous by his wickedness. Manywicked men have been men of might and renown; have built cities, andtheir names are found in history; but they have no name in the book oflife.
1Ki 16:29-34	<br>Ahab did evil above all that reigned before him, and did it with aparticular enmity both against Jehovah and Israel. He was not satisfiedwith breaking the second commandment by image-worship, he broke thefirst by worshipping other gods: making light of lesser sins makes wayfor greater. Marriages with daring offenders also imbolden inwickedness, and hurry men on to the greatest excesses. One of Ahab'ssubjects, following the example of his presumption, ventured to buildJericho. Like Achan, he meddled with the accursed thing; turned that tohis own use, which was devoted to God's honour: he began to build, indefiance of the curse well devoted to God's honour: he began to build,in defiance of the curse well known in Israel; but none ever hardenedhis heart against God, and prospered. Let the reading of this chaptercause us to mark the dreadful end of all the workers of iniquity. Andwhat does the history of all ungodly men furnish, what ever rank orsituation they move in, but sad examples of the same?
1Ki 17:1-7	<br>God wonderfully suits men to the work he designs them for. The timeswere fit for an Elijah; an Elijah was fit for them. The Spirit of theLord knows how to fit men for the occasions. Elijah let Ahab know thatGod was displeased with the idolaters, and would chastise them by thewant of rain, which it was not in the power of the gods they served tobestow. Elijah was commanded to hide himself. If Providence calls us tosolitude and retirement, it becomes us to go: when we cannot be useful,we must be patient; and when we cannot work for God, we must sit stillquietly for him. The ravens were appointed to bring him meat, and didso. Let those who have but from hand to mouth, learn to live uponProvidence, and trust it for the bread of the day, in the day. Godcould have sent angels to minister to him; but he chose to show that hecan serve his own purposes by the meanest creatures, as effectually asby the mightiest. Elijah seems to have continued thus above a year. Thenatural supply of water, which came by common providence, failed; butthe miraculous supply of food, made sure to him by promise, failed not.If the heavens fail, the earth fails of course; such are all ourcreature-comforts: we lose them when we most need them, like brooks insummer. But there is a river which makes glad the city of God, thatnever runs dry, a well of water that springs up to eternal life. Lord,give us that living water! (1Ki 17:8-16)
1Ki 17:8-16	<br>Many widows were in Israel in the days of Elias, and some, it islikely, would have bidden him welcome to their houses; yet he is sentto honour and bless with his presence a city of Sidon, a Gentile city,and so becomes the first prophet of the Gentiles. Jezebel was Elijah'sgreatest enemy; yet, to show her how powerless was her malice, God willfind a hiding-place for him even in her own country. The personappointed to entertain Elijah is not one of the rich or great men ofSidon; but a poor widow woman, in want, and desolate, is made both ableand willing to sustain him. It is God's way, and it is his glory, tomake use of, and put honour upon, the weak and foolish things of theworld. O woman, great was thy faith; one has not found the like, no notin Israel. She took the prophet's word, that she should not lose by it.Those who can venture upon the promise of God, will make no difficultyto expose and empty themselves in his service, by giving him his partfirst. Surely the increase of this widow's faith, so as to enable herthus readily to deny herself, and to depend upon the Divine promise,was as great a miracle in the kingdom of grace, as the increase of hermeal and oil in the kingdom of providence. Happy are all who can thus,against hope, believe and obey in hope. One poor meal's meat this poorwidow gave the prophet; in recompence of it, she and her son did eatabove two years, in a time of famine. To have food from God's specialfavour, and in such good company as Elijah, made it more than doublysweet. It is promised to those who trust in God, that they shall not beashamed in evil time; in days of famine they shall be satisfied.
1Ki 17:17-24	<br>Neither faith nor obedience shut out afflictions and death. The childbeing dead, the mother spake to the prophet, rather to give vent to hersorrow, than in hope of relief. When God removes our comforts from us,he remembers our sins against us, perhaps the sins of our youth, thoughlong since past. When God remembers our sins against us, he designs toteach us to remember them against ourselves, and to repent of them.Elijah's prayer was doubtless directed by the Holy Spirit. The childrevived. See the power of prayer, and the power of Him who hearsprayer.
1Ki 18:1-16	<br>The severest judgments, of themselves, will not humble or change thehearts of sinners; nothing, except the blood of Jesus Christ, can atonefor the guilt of sin; nothing, except the sanctifying Spirit of God,can purge away its pollution. The priests and the Levites were gone toJudah and Jerusalem, 2Ch 11:13,14, but instead of them God raised upprophets, who read and expounded the word. They probably were from theschools of the prophets, first set up by Samuel. They had not thespirit of prophecy as Elijah, but taught the people to keep close tothe God of Israel. These Jezebel sought to destroy. The few thatescaped death were forced to hide themselves. God has his remnant amongall sorts, high and low; and that faith, fear, and love of his name,which are the fruits of the Holy Spirit, will be accepted through theRedeemer. See how wonderfully God raises up friends for his ministersand people, for their shelter in difficult times. Bread and water werenow scarce, yet Obadiah will find enough for God's prophets, to keepthem alive. Ahab's care was not to lose all the beasts; but he took nocare about his soul, not to lose that. He took pains to seek grass, butnone to seek the favour of God; fencing against the effect, but notinquiring how to remove the cause. But it bodes well with a people,when God calls his ministers to stand forth, and show themselves. Andwe may the better endure the bread of affliction, while our eyes seeour teachers.
1Ki 18:17-20	<br>One may guess how people stand affected to God, by observing how theystand affected to his people and ministers. It has been the lot of thebest and most useful men, like Elijah, to be called and counted thetroublers of the land. But those who cause God's judgments do themischief, not he that foretells them, and warns the nation to repent.
1Ki 18:21-40	<br>Many of the people wavered in their judgment, and varied in theirpractice. Elijah called upon them to determine whether Jehovah or Baalwas the self-existent, supreme God, the Creator, Governor, and Judge ofthe world, and to follow him alone. It is dangerous to halt between theservice of God and the service of sin, the dominion of Christ and thedominion of our lusts. If Jesus be the only Saviour, let us cleave tohim alone for every thing; if the Bible be the world of God, let usreverence and receive the whole of it, and submit our understanding tothe Divine teaching it contains. Elijah proposed to bring the matter toa trial. Baal had all the outward advantages, but the event encouragesall God's witnesses and advocates never to fear the face of man. TheGod that answers by fire, let him be God: the atonement was to be madeby sacrifice, before the judgment could be removed in mercy. The Godtherefore that has power to pardon sin, and to signify it by consumingthe sin-offering, must needs be the God that can relieve from thecalamity. God never required his worshippers to honour him in themanner of the worshippers of Baal; but the service of the devil, thoughsometimes it pleases and pampers the body, yet, in other things, reallyis cruel to it, as in envy and drunkenness. God requires that wemortify our lusts and corruptions; but bodily penances and severitiesare no pleasure to him. Who has required these things at your hands? Afew words uttered in assured faith, and with fervent affection for theglory of God, and love to the souls of men, or thirstings after theLord's image and his favour, form the effectual, fervent prayer of therighteous man, which availeth much. Elijah sought not his own glory,but that of God, for the good of the people. The people are all agreed,convinced, and satisfied; Jehovah, he is the God. Some, we hope, hadtheir hearts turned, but most of them were convinced only, notconverted. Blessed are they that have not seen what these saw, yet havebelieved, and have been wrought upon by it, more than they that saw it.
1Ki 18:41-46	<br>Israel, being so far reformed as to acknowledge the Lord to be God, andto consent to the execution of Baal's prophets, was so far accepted,that God poured out blessing upon the land. Elijah long continuedpraying. Though the answer of our fervent and believing supplicationsdoes not come quickly, we must continue earnest in prayer, and notfaint or give over. A little cloud at length appeared, which soonoverspread the heavens, and watered the earth. Great blessings oftenarise from small beginnings, showers of plenty from a cloud of spanlong. Let us never despise the day of small things, but hope and waitfor great things from it. From what small beginnings have great mattersarisen! It is thus in all the gracious proceedings of God with thesoul. Scarcely to be perceived are the first workings of his Spirit inthe heart, which grow up at last to the wonder of men, and applause ofangels. Elijah hastened Ahab home, and attended him. God willstrengthen his people for every service to which his commandments andprovidence call them. The awful displays of Divine justice and holinessdismay the sinner, extort confessions, and dispose to outward obediencewhile the impression lasts; but the view of these, with mercy, love,and truth in Christ Jesus, is needful to draw the soul toself-abasement, trust, and love. The Holy Spirit employs both in theconversion of sinners; when sinners are impressed with Divine truths,they should be exhorted to set about the duties to which the Saviourcalls his disciples.
1Ki 19:1-8	<br>Jezebel sent Elijah a threatening message. Carnal hearts are hardenedand enraged against God, by that which should convince and conquerthem. Great faith is not always alike strong. He might be serviceableto Israel at this time, and had all reason to depend upon God'sprotection, while doing God's work; yet he flees. His was not thedeliberate desire of grace, as Paul's, to depart and be with Christ.God thus left Elijah to himself, to show that when he was bold andstrong, it was in the Lord, and the power of his might; but of himselfhe was no better than his fathers. God knows what he designs us for,though we do not, what services, what trials, and he will take carethat we are furnished with grace sufficient.
1Ki 19:9-13	<br>The question God put, What doest thou here, Elijah? is a reproof. Itconcerns us often to ask whether we are in our place, and in the way ofour duty. Am I where I should be? whither God calls me, where mybusiness lies, and where I may be useful? He complained of the people,and their obstinacy in sin; I only am left. Despair of success hindersmany a good enterprise. Did Elijah come hither to meet with God? heshall find that God will meet him. The wind, and earthquake, and fire,did not make him cover his face, but the still voice did. Gracioussouls are more affected by the tender mercies of the Lord, than by histerrors. The mild voice of Him who speaks from the cross, or themercy-seat, is accompanied with peculiar power in taking possession ofthe heart.
1Ki 19:14-18	<br>God repeated the question, What doest thou here? Then he complained ofhis discouragement; and whither should God's prophets go with theircomplaints of that kind, but to their Master? The Lord gave him ananswer. He declares that the wicked house of Ahab shall be rooted out,that the people of Israel shall be punished for their sins; and heshows that Elijah was not left alone as he had supposed, and also thata helper should at once be raised up for him. Thus all his complaintsare answered and provided for. God's faithful ones are often his hiddenones, Ps 83:3, and the visible church is scarcely to be seen: the wheatis lost in chaff, and the gold in dross, till the sifting, refining,separating day comes. The Lord knows them that are his, though we donot; he sees in secret. When we come to heaven we shall miss many whomwe thought to have met there; we shall meet many whom we little thoughtto have met there. God's love often proves larger than man's charity,and far more extended.
1Ki 19:19-21	<br>Elijah found Elisha by Divine direction, not in the schools of theprophets, but in the field; not reading, or praying, or sacrificing,but ploughing. Idleness is no man's honour, nor is husbandry any man'sdisgrace. An honest calling in the world, does not put us out of theway of our heavenly calling, any more than it did Elisha. His heart wastouched by the Holy Spirit, and he was ready to leave all to attendElijah. It is in a day of power that Christ's subjects are madewilling; nor would any come to Christ unless they were thus drawn. Itwas a discouraging time for prophets to set out in. A man that hadconsulted with flesh and blood, would not be fond of Elijah's mantle;yet Elisha cheerfully leaves all to accompany him. When the Savioursaid to one and to another, Follow me, the dearest friends and mostprofitable occupations were cheerfully left, and the most arduousduties done from love to his name. May we, in like manner, feel theenergy of his grace working in us mightily, and by unreservedsubmission at once, may we make our calling and election sure.
1Ki 20:1-11	<br>Benhadad sent Ahab a very insolent demand. Ahab sent a very disgracefulsubmission; sin brings men into such straits, by putting them out ofthe Divine protection. If God do not rule us, our enemies shall: guiltdispirits men, and makes them cowards. Ahab became desperate. Men willpart with their most pleasant things, those they most love, to savetheir lives; yet they lose their souls rather than part with anypleasure or interest to prevent it. Here is one of the wisest sayingsthat ever Ahab spake, and it is a good lesson to all. It is folly toboast of any day to come, since we know not what it may bring forth.Apply it to our spiritual conflicts. Peter fell by self-confidence.Happy is the man who is never off his watch.
1Ki 20:12-21	<br>The proud Syrians were beaten, and the despised Israelites wereconquerors. The orders of the proud, drunken king disordered histroops, and prevented them from attacking the Israelites. Those thatare most secure, are commonly least courageous. Ahab slew the Syrianswith a great slaughter. God often makes one wicked man a scourge toanother.
1Ki 20:22-30	<br>Those about Benhadad advised him to change his ground. They take it forgranted that it was not Israel, but Israel's gods, that beat them; butthey speak very ignorantly of Jehovah. They supposed that Israel hadmany gods, to whom they ascribed limited power within a certaindistrict; thus vain were the Gentiles in their imaginations concerningGod. The greatest wisdom in worldly concerns is often united with themost contemptible folly in the things of God.
1Ki 20:31-43	<br>This encouragement sinners have to repent and humble themselves beforeGod; Have we not heard, that the God of Israel is a merciful God? Havewe not found him so? That is gospel repentance, which flows from anapprehension of the mercy of God, in Christ; there is forgiveness withhim. What a change is here! The most haughty in prosperity often aremost abject in adversity; an evil spirit will thus affect a man in boththese conditions. There are those on whom, like Ahab, success is illbestowed; they know not how to serve either God or their generation, oreven their own true interests with their prosperity: Let favour beshowed to the wicked, yet will he not learn righteousness. The prophetdesigned to reprove Ahab by a parable. If a good prophet were punishedfor sparing his friend and God's when God said, Smite, of much sorerpunishment should a wicked king be thought worthy, who spared his enemyand God's, when God said, Smite. Ahab went to his house, heavy anddispleased, not truly penitent, or seeking to undo what he had doneamiss; every way out of humour, notwithstanding his victory. Alas! manythat hear the glad tidings of Christ, are busy and there till the dayof salvation is gone.
1Ki 21:1-4	<br>Naboth, perhaps, had been pleased that he had a vineyard situated sonear the palace, but the situation proved fatal to him; many a man'spossessions have been his snare, and his neighbourhood to greatness, ofbad consequence. Discontent is a sin that is its own punishment, andmakes men torment themselves. It is a sin that is its own parent; itarises not from the condition, but from the mind: as we find Paulcontented in a prison, so Ahab was discontented in a palace. He had allthe delights of Canaan, that pleasant land, at command; the wealth of akingdom, the pleasures of a court, and the honours and powers of athrone; yet all avails him nothing without Naboth's vineyard. Wrongdesires expose men to continual vexations, and those that are disposedto fret, however well off, may always find something or other to fretat.
1Ki 21:5-16	<br>When, instead of a help meet, a man has an agent for Satan, in the formof an artful, unprincipled, yet beloved wife, fatal effects may beexpected. Never were more wicked orders given by any prince, than thoseJezebel sent to the rulers of Jezreel. Naboth must be murdered undercolour of religion. There is no wickedness so vile, so horrid, butreligion has sometimes been made a cover for it. Also, it must be doneunder colour of justice, and with the formalities of legal process. Letus, from this sad story, be amazed at the wickedness of the wicked, andthe power of Satan in the children of disobedience. Let us commit thekeeping of our lives and comforts to God, for innocence will not alwaysbe our security; and let us rejoice in the knowledge that all will beset to rights in the great day.
1Ki 21:17-29	<br>Blessed Paul complains that he was sold under sin, Ro 7:14, as a poorcaptive against his will; but Ahab was willing, he sold himself to sin;of choice, and as his own act and deed, he loved the dominion of sin.Jezebel his wife stirred him up to do wickedly. Ahab is reproved, andhis sin set before his eyes, by Elijah. That man's condition is verymiserable, who has made the word of God his enemy; and very desperate,who reckons the ministers of that word his enemies, because they tellhim the truth. Ahab put on the garb and guise of a penitent, yet hisheart was unhumbled and unchanged. Ahab's repentance was only whatmight be seen of men; it was outward only. Let this encourage all thattruly repent, and unfeignedly believe the holy gospel, that if apretending partial penitent shall go to his house reprieved, doubtless,a sincere believing penitent shall go to his house justified.
1Ki 22:1-14	<br>The same easiness of temper, which betrays some godly persons intofriendship with the declared enemies of religion, renders it verydangerous to them. They will be drawn to wink at and countenance suchconduct and conversation as they ought to protest against withabhorrence. Whithersoever a good man goes, he ought to take hisreligion with him, and not be ashamed to own it when he is with thosewho have no regard for it. Jehoshaphat had not left behind him, atJerusalem, his affection and reverence for the word of the Lord, butavowed it, and endeavoured to bring it into Ahab's court. And Ahab'sprophets, to please Jehoshaphat, made use of the name of Jehovah: toplease Ahab, they said, Go up. But the false prophets cannot so mimicthe true, but that he who has spiritual senses exercised, can discernthe fallacy. One faithful prophet of the Lord was worth them all.Wordly men have in all ages been alike absurd in their views ofreligion. They would have the preacher fit his doctrine to the fashionof the times, and the taste of the hearers, and yet to add, Thus saiththe Lord, to words that men would put into their mouths. They are readyto cry out against a man as rude and foolish, who scruples thus to tryto secure his own interests, and to deceive others.
1Ki 22:15-28	<br>The greatest kindness we can do to one that is going in a dangerousway, is, to tell him of his danger. To leave the hardened criminalwithout excuse, and to give a useful lesson to others, Micaiah relatedhis vision. This matter is represented after the manner of men: we arenot to imagine that God is ever put upon new counsels; or that he needsto consult with angels, or any creature, about the methods he shouldtake; or that he is the author of sin, or the cause of any man'stelling or believing a lie. Micaiah returned not the blow of Zedekiah,yet, since he boasted of the Spirit, as those commonly do that knowleast of the Holy Spirit's operations, the true prophet left him to beconvinced of his error by the event. Those that will not have theirmistakes set right in time, by the word of God, will be undeceived,when it is too late, by the judgments of God. We should be ashamed ofwhat we call trials, were we to consider what the servants of God haveendured. Yet it will be well, if freedom from trouble prove not morehurtful to us; we are more easily allured and bribed intounfaithfulness and conformity to the world, than driven to them.
1Ki 22:29-40	<br>Ahab basely intended to betray Johoshaphat to danger, that he mightsecure himself. See what they get that join with wicked men. How can itbe expected that he should be true to his friend, who has been false tohis God! He had said in compliment to Ahab, I am as thou art, and nowhe was indeed taken for him. Those that associate with evil-doers, arein danger of sharing in their plagues. By Jehoshaphat's deliverance,God let him know, that though he was displeased with him, yet he hadnot deserted him. God is a friend that will not fail us when otherfriends do. Let no man think to hide himself from God's judgment. Goddirected the arrow to hit Ahab; those cannot escape with life, whom Godhas doomed to death. Ahab lived long enough to see part of Micaiah'sprophecy accomplished. He had time to feel himself die; with whathorror must he have thought upon the wickedness he had committed!
1Ki 22:41-50	<br>Jehoshaphat's reign appears to have been one of the best, both as topiety and prosperity. He pleased God, and God blessed him.
1Ki 22:51-53	<br>Ahaziah's reign was very short, not two years; some sinners God makesquick work with. A very bad character is given of him; he listened notto instruction, took no warning, but followed the example of his wickedfather, and the counsel of his more wicked mother, Jezebel, who wasstill living. Miserable are the children who not only derive a sinfulnature from their parents, but are taught by them to increase it; andmost unhappy parents are they, that help to damn their children'ssouls. Hardened sinners rush forward, unawed and unmoved, in the waysfrom which others before them have been driven into everlasting misery.
2Ki 1:1-8	<br>When Ahaziah rebelled against the Lord, Moab revolted from him. Sinweakens and impoverishes us. Man's revolt from God is often punished bythe rebellion of those who owe subjection to him. Ahaziah fell througha lattice, or railing. Wherever we go, there is but a step between usand death. A man's house is his castle, but not to secure him againstGod's judgments. The whole creation, which groans under the burden ofman's sin, will, at length, sink and break under the weight like thislattice. He is never safe that has God for his enemy. Those that willnot inquire of the word of God for their comfort, shall hear it totheir terror, whether they will or no.
2Ki 1:9-18	<br>Elijah called for fire from heaven, to consume the haughty, daringsinners; not to secure himself, but to prove his mission, and to revealthe wrath of God from heaven, against the ungodliness andunrighteousness of men. Elijah did this by a Divine impulse, yet ourSaviour would not allow the disciples to do the like, Lu 9:54. Thedispensation of the Spirit and of grace by no means allowed it. Elijahwas concerned for God's glory, those for their own reputation. The Lordjudges men's practices by their principles, and his judgment isaccording to truth. The third captain humbled himself, and cast himselfupon the mercy of God and Elijah. There is nothing to be got bycontending with God; and those are wise for themselves, who learnsubmission from the fatal end of obstinacy in others. The courage offaith has often struck terror into the heart of the proudest sinner. Sothunderstruck is Ahaziah with the prophet's words, that neither he, norany about him, offer him violence. Who can harm those whom Godshelters? Many who think to prosper in sin, are called hence likeAhaziah, when they do not expect it. All warns us to seek the Lordwhile he may be found.
2Ki 2:1-8	<br>The Lord had let Elijah know that his time was at hand. He thereforewent to the different schools of the prophets to give them his lastexhortations and blessing. The removal of Elijah was a type and figureof the ascension of Christ, and the opening of the kingdom of heaven toall believers. Elisha had long followed Elijah, and he would not leavehim now when he hoped for the parting blessing. Let not those whofollow Christ come short by tiring at last. The waters of Jordan, ofold, yielded to the ark; now, to the prophet's mantle, as a token ofGod's presence. When God will take up his faithful ones to heaven,death is the Jordan which they must pass through, and they find a waythrough it. The death of Christ has divided those waters, that theransomed of the Lord may pass over. O death, where is thy sting, thyhurt, thy terror!
2Ki 2:9-12	<br>That fulness, from whence prophets and apostles had all their supply,still exists as of old, and we are told to ask large supplies from it.Diligent attendance upon Elijah, particularly in his last hours, wouldbe proper means for Elisha to obtain much of his spirit. The comfortsof departing saints, and their experiences, help both to gild ourcomforts and to strengthen our resolutions. Elijah is carried to heavenin a fiery chariot. Many questions might be asked about this, whichcould not be answered. Let it suffice that we are told, what his Lord,when he came, found him doing. He was engaged in serious discourse,encouraging and directing Elisha about the kingdom of God among men. Wemistake, if we think preparation for heaven is carried on only bycontemplation and acts of devotion. The chariot and horses appearedlike fire, something very glorious, not for burning, but brightness. Bythe manner in which Elijah and Enoch were taken from this world, Godgave a glimpse of the eternal life brought to light by the gospel, ofthe glory reserved for the bodies of the saints, and of the opening ofthe kingdom of heaven to all believers. It was also a figure ofChrist's ascension. Though Elijah was gone triumphantly to heaven, yetthis world could ill spare him. Surely their hearts are hard, who feelnot, when God, by taking away faithful, useful men, calls for weepingand mourning. Elijah was to Israel, by his counsels, reproofs, andprayers, better than the strongest force of chariot and horse, and keptoff the judgments of God. Christ bequeathed to his disciples hisprecious gospel, like Elijah's mantle; the token of the Divine powerbeing exerted to overturn the empire of Satan, and to set up thekingdom of God in the world. The same gospel remains with us, thoughthe miraculous powers are withdrawn, and it has Divine strength for theconversion and salvation of sinners.
2Ki 2:13-18	<br>Elijah left his mantle to Elisha; as a token of the descent of theSpirit upon him; it was more than if he had left him thousands of goldand silver. Elisha took it up, not as a sacred relic to be worshipped,but as a significant garment to be worn. Now that Elijah was taken toheaven, Elisha inquired, 1. After God; when our creature-comforts areremoved, we have a God to go to, who lives for ever. 2. After the Godthat Elijah served, and honoured, and pleaded for. The Lord God of theholy prophets is the same yesterday, to-day, and for ever; but whatwill it avail us to have the mantles of those that are gone, theirplaces, their books, if we have not their spirit, their God? SeeElisha's dividing the river; God's people need not fear at last passingthrough the Jordan of death as on dry ground. The sons of the prophetsmade a needless search for Elijah. Wise men may yield to that, for thesake of peace, and the good opinion of others, which yet their judgmentis against, as needless and fruitless. Traversing hills and valleyswill never bring us to Elijah, but following the example of his holyfaith and zeal will, in due time.
2Ki 2:19-25	<br>Observe the miracle of healing the waters. Prophets should make everyplace to which they come better for them, endeavouring to sweetenbitter spirits, and to make barren souls fruitful, by the word of God,which is like the salt cast into the water by Elisha. It was an aptemblem of the effect produced by the grace of God on the sinful heartof man. Whole families, towns, and cities, sometimes have a newappearance through the preaching of the gospel; wickedness and evilhave been changed into fruitfulness in the works of righteousness,which are, through Christ, to the praise and glory of God. Here is acurse on the youths of Bethel, enough to destroy them; it was not acurse causeless, for it was Elisha's character, as God's prophet, thatthey abused. They bade him "go up," reflecting on the taking up ofElijah into heaven. The prophet acted by Divine impulse. If the HolySpirit had not directed Elisha's solemn curse, the providence of Godwould not have followed it with judgment. The Lord must be glorified asa righteous God who hates sin, and will reckon for it. Let youngpersons be afraid of speaking wicked words, for God notices what theysay. Let them not mock at any for defects in mind or body; especiallyit is at their peril, if they scoff at any for well doing. Let parentsthat would have comfort in their children, train them up well, and dotheir utmost betimes to drive out the foolishness that is bound up intheir hearts. And what will be the anguish of those parents, at the dayof judgment, who witness the everlasting condemnation of theiroffspring, occasioned by their own bad example, carelessness, or wickedteaching!
2Ki 3:1-5	<br>Jehoram took warning by God's judgment, and put away the image of Baal,yet he maintained the worship of the calves. Those do not truly repentor reform, who only part with the sins they lose by, but continue tolove the sins that they think to gain by.
2Ki 3:6-19	<br>The king of Israel laments their distress, and the danger they were in.He called these kings together, yet he charges it upon Providence. Thusthe foolishness of man perverteth his way, and then his heart frettethagainst the Lord, Pr 19:3. It was well that Jehoshaphat inquired of theLord now, but it had been much better if he had done it before heengaged in this war. Good men sometimes neglect their duty, tillnecessity and affliction drive them to it. Wicked people often fare thebetter for the friendship and society of the godly. To try their faithand obedience, Elisha bids them make the valley full of pits to receivewater. Those who expect God's blessings, must dig pools for the rain tofill, as in the valley of Baca, and thus make even that a well, Ps84:6. We need not inquire whence the water came. God is not tied tosecond causes. They that sincerely seek for the dew of God's grace,shall have it, and by it be made more than conquerors.
2Ki 3:20-27	<br>It is a blessing to be favoured with the company of those who havepower with God, and can prevail by their prayers. A kingdom may beupheld and prosper, in consequence of the fervent prayers of those whoare dear to God. May we place our highest regard upon such as are mostprecious in his account. When sinners are saying Peace, peace,destruction comes upon them: despair will follow their mad presumption.In Satan's service and at his suggestion, such horrid deeds have beendone, as cause the natural feelings of the heart to shudder; like theking of Moab's sacrificing his son. It is well not to urge the worst ofmen to extremities; we should rather leave them to the judgment of God.
2Ki 4:1-7	<br>Elisha's miracles were acts of real charity: Christ's were so; not onlygreat wonders, but great favours to those for whom they were wrought.God magnifies his goodness with his power. Elisha readily received apoor widow's complaint. Those that leave their families under a load ofdebt, know not what trouble they cause. It is the duty of all whoprofess to follow the Lord, while they trust to God for daily bread,not to tempt him by carelessness or extravagance, nor to contractdebts; for nothing tends more to bring reproach upon the gospel, ordistresses their families more when they are gone. Elisha put the widowin a way to pay her debt, and to maintain herself and her family. Thiswas done by miracle, but so as to show what is the best method toassist those who are in distress, which is, to help them to improve bytheir own industry what little they have. The oil, sent by miracle,continued flowing as long as she had empty vessels to receive it. Weare never straitened in God, or in the riches of his grace; all ourstraitness is in ourselves. It is our faith that fails, not hispromise. He gives more than we ask: were there more vessels, there isenough in God to fill them; enough for all, enough for each; and theRedeemer's all-sufficiency will only be stayed from the supplying thewants of sinners and saving their souls, when no more apply to him forsalvation. The widow must pay her debt with the money she received forher oil. Though her creditors were too hard with her, yet they must bepaid, even before she made any provision for her children. It is one ofthe main laws of the Christian religion, that we pay every just debt,and give every one his own, though we leave ever so little forourselves; and this, not of constraint, but for conscience' sake. Thosewho bear an honest mind, cannot with pleasure eat their daily bread,unless it be their own bread. She and her children must live upon therest; that is, upon the money received for the oil, with which theymust put themselves into a way to get an honest livelihood. We cannotnow expect miracles, yet we may expect mercies, if we wait on God, andseek to him. Let widows in particular depend upon him. He that has allhearts in his hand, can, without a miracle, send as effectual a supply.
2Ki 4:8-17	<br>Elisha was well thought of by the king of Israel for his late services;a good man can take as much pleasure in serving others, as in raisinghimself. But the Shunammite needed not any good offices of this kind.It is a happiness to dwell among our own people, that love and respectus, and to whom we are able to do good. It would be well with many, ifthey did but know when they are really well off. The Lord sees thesecret wish which is suppressed in obedience to his will, and he willhear the prayers of his servants in behalf of their benefactors, bysending unasked-for and unexpected mercies; nor must the professions ofmen of God be supposed to be delusive like those of men of the world.
2Ki 4:18-37	<br>Here is the sudden death of the child. All the mother's tendernesscannot keep alive a child of promise, a child of prayer, one given inlove. But how admirably does the prudent, pious mother, guard her lipsunder this sudden affliction! Not one peevish word escapes from her.Such confidence had she of God's goodness, that she was ready tobelieve that he would restore what he had now taken away. O woman,great is thy faith! He that wrought it, would not disappoint it. Thesorrowful mother begged leave of her husband to go to the prophet atonce. She had not thought it enough to have Elisha's help sometimes inher own family, but, though a woman of rank, attended on publicworship. It well becomes the men of God, to inquire about the welfareof their friends and their families. The answer was, It is well. Allwell, and yet the child dead in the house! Yes! All is well that Goddoes; all is well with them that are gone, if they are gone to heaven;and all well with us that stay behind, if, by the affliction, we arefurthered in our way thither. When any creature-comfort is taken fromus, it is well if we can say, through grace, that we did not set ourhearts too much upon it; for if we did, we have reason to fear it wasgiven in anger, and taken away in wrath. Elisha cried unto God infaith; and the beloved son was restored alive to his mother. Those whowould convey spiritual life to dead souls, must feel deeply for theircase, and labour fervently in prayer for them. Though the ministercannot give Divine life to his fellow-sinners, he must use every means,with as much earnestness as if he could do so.
2Ki 4:38-44	<br>There was a famine of bread, but not of hearing the word of God, forElisha had the sons of the prophets sitting before him, to hear hiswisdom. Elisha made hurtful food to become safe and wholesome. If amess of pottage be all our dinner, remember that this great prophet hadno better for himself and his guests. The table often becomes a snare,and that which should be for our welfare, proves a trap: this is a goodreason why we should not feed ourselves without fear. When we arereceiving the supports and comforts of life, we must keep up anexpectation of death, and a fear of sin. We must acknowledge God'sgoodness in making our food wholesome and nourishing; I am the Lordthat healeth thee. Elisha also made a little food go a great way.Having freely received, he freely gave. God has promised his church,that he will abundantly bless her provision, and satisfy her poor withbread, Ps 132:15; whom he feeds, he fills; and what he blesses, comesto much. Christ's feeding his hearers was a miracle far beyond this,but both teach us that those who wait upon God in the way of duty, mayhope to be supplied by Divine Providence.
2Ki 5:1-8	<br>Though the Syrians were idolaters, and oppressed God's people, yet thedeliverance of which Naaman had been the means, is here ascribed to theLord. Such is the correct language of Scripture, while those who writecommon history, plainly show that God is not in all their thoughts. Noman's greatness, or honour, can place him our of the reach of thesorest calamities of human life: there is many a sickly, crazy bodyunder rich and gay clothing. Every man has some but or other, somethingthat blemishes and diminishes him, some allay to his grandeur, somedamp to his joy. This little maid, though only a girl, could give anaccount of the famous prophet the Israelites had among them. Childrenshould be early told of the wondrous works of God, that, wherever theygo, they may talk of them. As became a good servant, she desired thehealth and welfare of her master, though she was a captive, a servantby force; much more should servants by choice, seek their masters'good. Servants may be blessings to the families where they are, bytelling what they know of the glory of God, and the honour of hisprophets. Naaman did not despise what she told, because of hermeanness. It would be well if men were as sensible of the burden of sinas they are of bodily disease. And when they seek the blessings whichthe Lord sends in answer to the prayers of his faithful people, theywill find nothing can be had, except they come as beggars for a freegift, not as lords to demand or purchase.
2Ki 5:9-14	<br>Elisha knew Naaman to be a proud man, and he would let him know, thatbefore the great God all men stand upon the same level. All God'scommands make trial of men's spirits, especially those which direct asinner how to apply for the blessings of salvation. See in Naaman thefolly of pride; a cure will not content him, unless he be cured withpomp and parade. He scorns to be healed, unless he be humoured. The wayby which a sinner is received and made holy, through the blood, and bythe Spirit of Christ, through faith alone in his name, does notsufficiently humour or employ self, to please the sinner's heart. Humanwisdom thinks it can supply wiser and better methods of cleansing.Observe, masters should be willing to hear reason. As we should be deafto the counsel of the ungodly, though given by great and respectednames, so we are to have our ears open to good advice, though broughtby those below us. Wouldst thou not do any thing? When diseased sinnersare content to do any thing, to submit to any thing, to part with anything, for a cure, then, and not till then, is there any hope of them.The methods for the healing of the leprosy of sin, are so plain, thatwe are without excuse if we do not observe them. It is but, Believe,and be saved; Repent, and be pardoned; Wash, and be clean. The believerapplies for salvation, not neglecting, altering, or adding to theSaviour's directions; he is thus made clean from guilt, while others,who neglect them, live and die in the leprosy of sin.
2Ki 5:15-19	<br>The mercy of the cure affected Naaman more than the miracle. Those arebest able to speak of the power of Divine grace, who themselvesexperience it. He also shows himself grateful to Elisha the prophet.Elijah refused any recompence, not because he thought it unlawful, forhe received presents from others, but to show this new convert that theservants of the God of Israel looked upon worldly wealth with a holycontempt. The whole work was from God, in such a manner, that theprophet would not give counsel when he had no directions from the Lord.It is not well violently to oppose the lesser mistakes which unite withmen's first convictions; we cannot bring men forward any faster thanthe Lord prepares them to receive instruction. Yet as to us, if, incovenanting with God, we desire to reserve any known sin, to continueto indulge ourselves in it, that is a breach of his covenant. Those whotruly hate evil, will make conscience of abstaining from allappearances of evil.
2Ki 5:20-27	<br>Naaman, a Syrian, a courtier, a soldier, had many servants, and we readhow wise and good they were. Elisha, a holy prophet, a man of God, hasbut one servant, and he proves a base liar. The love of money, thatroot of all evil, was at the bottom of Gehazi's sin. He thought toimpose upon the prophet, but soon found that the Spirit of prophecycould not be deceived, and that it was in vain to lie to the HolyGhost. It is folly to presume upon sin, in hopes of secrecy. When thougoest aside into any by-path, does not thy own conscience go with thee?Does not the eye of God go with thee? He that covers his sin, shall notprosper; particularly, a lying tongue is but for a moment. All thefoolish hopes and contrivances of carnal worldlings are open beforeGod. It is not a time to increase our wealth, when we can only do it insuch ways as are dishonourable to God and religion, or injurious toothers. Gehazi was punished. If he will have Naaman's money, he shallhave his disease with it. What was Gehazi profited, though he gainedtwo talents, when thereby he lost his health, his honour, his peace,his service, and, if repentance prevented not, his soul for ever? Letus beware of hypocrisy and covetousness, and dread the curse ofspiritual leprosy remaining on our souls.
2Ki 6:1-7	<br>There is that pleasantness in the converse of servants of God, whichcan make those who listen to them forget the pain and the weariness oflabour. Even the sons of the prophets must not be unwilling to labour.Let no man think an honest employment a burden or a disgrace. Andlabour of the head, is as hard, and very often harder, than labour withthe hands. We ought to be careful of that which is borrowed, as of ourown, because we must do as we would be done by. This man was sorespecting the axe-head. And to those who have an honest mind, thesorest grievance of poverty is, not so much their own want anddisgrace, as being rendered unable to pay just debts. But the Lordcares for his people in their smallest concerns. And God's grace canthus raise the stony iron heart, which is sunk into the mud of thisworld, and raise up affections, naturally earthly.
2Ki 6:8-12	<br>The king of Israel regarded the warnings Elisha gave him, of dangerfrom the Syrians, but would not heed the warnings of danger from hissins. Such warnings are little heeded by most; they would savethemselves from death, but will not from hell. Nothing that is done,said, or thought, by any person, in any place, at any time, is out ofGod's knowledge.
2Ki 6:13-23	<br>What Elisha said to his servant is spoken to all the faithful servantsof God, when without are fightings, and within are fears. Fear not,with that fear which has torment and amazement; for they that are withus, to protect us, are more than they that are against us, to destroyus. The eyes of his body were open, and with them he saw the danger.Lord, open the eyes of our faith, that with them we may see thyprotecting hand. The clearer sight we have of the sovereignty and powerof Heaven, the less we shall fear the troubles of earth. Satan, the godof this world, blinds men's eyes, and so deludes them unto their ownruin; but when God enlightens their eyes, they see themselves in themidst of their enemies, captives to Satan, and in danger of hell,though, before, they thought their condition good. When Elisha had theSyrians at his mercy, he made it appear that he was influenced byDivine goodness as well as Divine power. Let us not be overcome ofevil, but overcome evil with good. The Syrians saw it was to no purposeto try to assault so great and so good a man.
2Ki 6:24-33	<br>Learn to value plenty, and to be thankful for it; see how contemptiblemoney is, when in time of famine it is so freely parted with for anything that is eatable! The language of Jehoram to the woman may be thelanguage of despair. See the word of God fulfilled; among thethreatenings of God's judgments upon Israel for their sins, this wasone, that they should eat the flesh of their own children, De 28:53-57.The truth and the awful justice of God were displayed in this horribletransaction. Alas! what miseries sin has brought upon the world! Butthe foolishness of man perverts his way, and then his heart fretsagainst the Lord. The king swears the death of Elisha. Wicked men willblame any one as the cause of their troubles, rather than themselves,and will not leave their sins. If rending the clothes, without a brokenand contrite heart, would avail, if wearing sackcloth, without beingrenewed in the spirit of their mind, would serve, they would not standout against the Lord. May the whole word of God increase in us reverentfear and holy hope, that we may be stedfast and immovable, alwaysabounding in the work of the Lord, knowing that our labour is not invain in the Lord.
2Ki 7:1,2	<br>Man's extremity is God's opportunity of making his own power to beglorious: his time to appear for his people is when their strength isgone. Unbelief is a sin by which men greatly dishonour and displeaseGod, and deprive themselves of the favours he designed for them. Suchwill be the portion of those that believe not the promise of eternallife; they shall see it at a distance, but shall never taste of it. Butno temporal deliverances and mercies will in the end profit sinners,unless they are led to repentance by the goodness of God.
2Ki 7:3-11	<br>God can, when he pleases, make the stoutest heart to tremble; and asfor those who will not fear God, he can make them fear at the shakingof a leaf. Providence ordered it, that the lepers came as soon as theSyrians were fled. Their consciences told them that mischief wouldbefall them, if they took care of themselves only. Natural humanity,and fear of punishment, are powerful checks on the selfishness of theungodly. These feelings tend to preserve order and kindness in theworld; but they who have found the unsearchable riches of Christ, willnot long delay to report the good tidings to others. From love to him,not from selfish feelings, they will gladly share their earthly goodthings with their brethren.
2Ki 7:12-20	<br>Here see the wants of Israel supplied in a way they little thought of,which should encourage us to depend upon the power and goodness of Godin our greatest straits. God's promise may be safely relied on, for noword of his shall fall to the ground. The nobleman that questioned thetruth of Elisha's word, saw the plenty, to silence and shame hisunbelief, and therein saw his own folly; but he did not eat of theplenty he saw. Justly do those find the world's promises fail them, whothink that the promises of God will disappoint them. Learn how deeplyGod resents distrust of his power, providence, and promise: howuncertain life is, and the enjoyments of it: how certain God'sthreatenings are, and how sure to come on the guilty. May God help usto inquire whether we are exposed to his threatenings, or interested inhis promises.
2Ki 8:1-6	<br>The kindness of the good Shunammite to Elisha, was rewarded by the caretaken of her in famine. It is well to foresee an evil, and wisdom, whenwe foresee it, to hide ourselves if we lawfully may do so. When thefamine was over, she returned out of the land of the Philistines; thatwas no proper place for an Israelite, any longer than there wasnecessity for it. Time was when she dwelt so securely among her ownpeople, that she had no occasion to be spoken for to the king; butthere is much uncertainty in this life, so that things or persons mayfail us which we most depend upon, and those befriend us which we thinkwe shall never need. Sometimes events, small in themselves, prove ofconsequence, as here; for they made the king ready to believe Gehazi'snarrative, when thus confirmed. It made him ready to grant her request,and to support a life which was given once and again by miracle.
2Ki 8:7-15	<br>Among other changes of men's minds by affliction, it often gives otherthoughts of God's ministers, and teaches to value the counsels andprayers of those whom they have hated and despised. It was not inHazael's countenance that Elisha read what he would do, but Godrevealed it to him, and it fetched tears from his eyes: the moreforesight men have, the more grief they are liable to. It is possiblefor a man, under the convictions and restraints of natural conscience,to express great abhorrence of a sin, yet afterwards to be reconciledto it. Those that are little and low in the world, cannot imagine howstrong the temptations of power and prosperity are, which, if ever theyarrive at, they will find how deceitful their hearts are, how muchworse than they suspected. The devil ruins men, by saying they shallcertainly recover and do well, so rocking them asleep in security.Hazael's false account was an injury to the king, who lost the benefitof the prophet's warning to prepare for death, and an injury to Elisha,who would be counted a false prophet. It is not certain that Hazaelmurdered his master, or if he caused his death it may have been withoutany design. But he was a dissembler, and afterwards proved a persecutorto Israel.
2Ki 8:16-24	<br>A general idea is given of Jehoram's badness. His father, no doubt, hadhim taught the true knowledge of the Lord, but did ill to marry him tothe daughter of Ahab; no good could come of union with an idolatrousfamily.
2Ki 8:25-29	<br>Names do not make natures, but it was bad for Jehoshaphat's family toborrow names from Ahab's. Ahaziah's relation to Ahab's family was theoccasion of his wickedness and of his fall. When men choose wives forthemselves, let them remember they are choosing mothers for theirchildren. Providence so ordered it, that Ahaziah might be cut off withthe house of Ahab, when the measure of their iniquity was full. Thosewho partake with sinners in their sin, must expect to partake with themin their plagues. May all the changes, troubles, and wickedness of theworld, make us more earnest to obtain an interest in the salvation ofChrist.
2Ki 9:1-10	<br>In these and the like events, we must acknowledge the secret working ofGod, disposing men to fulfil his purposes respecting them. Jehu wasanointed king over Israel, by the Lord's special choice. The Lord stillhad a remnant of his people, and would yet preserve his worship amongthem. Of this Jehu was reminded. He was commanded to destroy the houseof Ahab, and, as far as he acted in obedience to God, and upon rightprinciples, he needed not to regard reproach or opposition. The murderof God's prophets is strongly noticed. Jezebel persisted in idolatryand enmity to Jehovah and his servants, and her iniquity was now full.
2Ki 9:11-15	<br>Those who faithfully deliver the Lord's message to sinners, have in allages been treated as madmen. Their judgment, speech, and conduct arecontrary to those of other men; they endure much in pursuit of objects,and are influenced by motives, into which the others cannot enter. Butabove all, the charge is brought by the worldly and ungodly of allsorts, who are mad indeed; while the principles and practice of thedevoted servants of God, prove to be wise and reasonable. Some faith inthe word of God, seems to have animated Jehu to this undertaking.
2Ki 9:16-29	<br>Jehu was a man of eager spirit. The wisdom of God is seen in the choiceof those employed in his work. But it is not for any man's reputationto be known by his fury. He that has rule over his own spirit, isbetter than the mighty. Joram met Jehu in the portion of Naboth. Thecircumstances of events are sometimes ordered by Divine Providence tomake the punishment answer to the sin, as face answers to face in aglass. The way of sin can never be the way of peace, Isa 57:21. Whatpeace can sinners have with God? No peace so long as sin is persistedin; but when it is repented of and forsaken, there is peace. Joram diedas a criminal, under the sentence of the law. Ahaziah was joined withthe house of Ahab. He was one of them; he had made himself so by sin.It is dangerous to join evil-doers; we shall be entangled in guilt andmisery by it.
2Ki 9:30-37	<br>Instead of hiding herself, as one afraid of Divine vengeance, Jezebelmocked at fear. See how a heart, hardened against God, will brave itout to the last. There is not a surer presage of ruin, than anunhumbled heart under humbling providences. Let those look at Jezebel'sconduct and fate, who use arts to seduce others to commit wickedness,and to draw them aside from the ways of truth and righteousness. Jehucalled for aid against Jezebel. When reformation-work is on foot, it istime to ask, Who sides with it? Her attendants delivered her up. Thusshe was put to death. See the end of pride and cruelty, and say, TheLord is righteous. When we pamper our bodies, let us think how vilethey are; shortly they will be a feast for worms under ground, orbeasts above ground. May we all flee from that wrath which is revealedfrom heaven, against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men.
2Ki 10:1-14	<br>In the most awful events, though attended by the basest crimes of man,the truth and justice of God are to be noticed; and he never did norcan command any thing unjust or unreasonable. Jehu destroyed all thatremained of the house of Ahab; all who had been partners in hiswickedness. When we think upon the sufferings and miseries of mankind,when we look forward to the resurrection and last judgment, and thinkupon the vast number of the wicked waiting their awful sentence ofeverlasting fire; when the whole sum of death and misery has beenconsidered, the solemn question occurs, Who slew all these? The answeris, SIN. Shall we then harbour sin in our bosoms, and seek forhappiness from that which is the cause of all misery?
2Ki 10:15-28	<br>Is thine heart right? This is a question we should often put toourselves. I make a fair profession, have gained a reputation amongmen, but, is my heart right? Am I sincere with God? Jehonadab ownedJehu in the work, both of revenge and of reformation. An upright heartapproves itself to God, and seeks no more than his acceptance; but ifwe aim at the applause of men, we are upon a false foundation. WhetherJehu looked any further we cannot judge. The law of God was express,that idolaters were to be put to death. Thus idolatry was abolished forthe present out of Israel. May we desire that it be rooted out of ourhearts.
2Ki 10:29-36	<br>It is justly questionable whether Jehu acted from a good principle, andwhether he did not take some false steps in doing it; yet no servicesdone for God shall go unrewarded. But true conversion is not only fromgross sin, but from all sin; not only from false gods, but from falseworships. True conversion is not only from wasteful sins, but fromgainful sins; not only from sins which hurt our worldly interests, butfrom those that support and befriend them; in forsaking which is thegreat trial whether we can deny ourselves and trust God. Jehu showedgreat care and zeal for rooting out a false religion, but in the truereligion he cared not, took no heed to please God and do his duty.Those that are heedless, it is to be feared, are graceless. The peoplewere also careless, therefore it is not strange that in those days theLord began to cut Israel short. They were short in their duty to God,therefore God cut them short in their extent, wealth, and power.
2Ki 11:1-12	<br>Athaliah destroyed all she knew to be akin to the crown. Jehoash, oneof the king's sons, was hid. Now was the promise made to David bound upin one life only, and yet it did not fail. Thus to the Son of David,the Lord, according to his promise, will secure a spiritual seed,hidden sometimes, and unseen, but hidden in God's pavilion, and unhurt.Six years Athaliah tyrannized. Then the king was brought forward. Achild indeed, but he had a good guardian, and, what was better, a goodGod to go to With such joy and satisfaction must the kingdom of Christbe welcomed into our hearts, when his throne is set up there, and Satanthe usurper is cast out. Say, Let the King, even Jesus, live, for everlive and reign in my soul, and in all the world.
2Ki 11:13-16	<br>Athaliah hastened her own destruction. She herself was the greatesttraitor, and yet was first and loudest in crying, Treason, treason! Themost guilty are commonly the most forward to reproach others.
2Ki 11:17-21	<br>King and people would cleave most firmly to each other, when both hadjoined themselves to the Lord. It is well with a people, when all thechanges that pass over them help to revive, strengthen, and advance theinterests of religion among them. Covenants are of use, both to remindus of, and bind us to, the duties already binding on us. Theyimmediately abolished idolatry; and, pursuant to the covenant with oneanother, they expressed mutual readiness to help each other. The peoplerejoiced, and Jerusalem was quiet. The way for people to be joyful andat peace, is to engage fully in the service of God; for the voice ofjoy and thanksgiving is in the dwellings of the righteous, but there isno peace for the wicked.
2Ki 12:1-16	<br>It is a great mercy to young people, especially to all young men ofrank, like Jehoash, to have those about them who will instruct them todo what is right in the sight of the Lord; and they do wisely and wellfor themselves, when willing to be counselled and ruled. The temple wasout of repair; Jehoash orders the repair of the temple. The king waszealous. God requires those who have power, to use it for the supportof religion, the redress of grievances, and repairing of decays. Theking employed the priests to manage, as most likely to be hearty in thework. But nothing was done effectually till the twenty-third year ofhis reign. Another method was therefore taken. When publicdistributions are made faithfully, public contributions will be madecheerfully. While they were getting all they could for the repair ofthe temple, they did not break in upon the stated maintenance of thepriests. Let not the servants of the temple be starved, under colour ofrepairing the breaches of it. Those that were intrusted did thebusiness carefully and faithfully. They did not lay it out in ornamentsfor the temple, till the other work was completed; hence we may learn,in all our expenses, to prefer that which is most needful, and, indealing for the public, to deal as we would for ourselves.
2Ki 12:17-21	<br>Let us review the character of Jehoash, and consider what we may learnfrom it. When we see what a sad conclusion there was to so promising abeginning, it ought to make us seek into our spiritual declinings. Ifwe know any thing of Christ as the foundation of our faith and hope,let us desire to know nothing but Christ. May the work of the blessedSpirit on our souls be manifest; may we see, feel, and be earnest, inseeking after Jesus in all his fulness, suitableness, and grace, thatour souls may be brought over from dead works to serve the living andtrue God.
2Ki 13:1-9	<br>It was the ancient honour of Israel that they were a praying people.Jehoahaz, their king, in his distress, besought the Lord; appliedhimself for help, but not to the calves; what help could they give him?He sought the Lord. See how swift God is to show mercy; how ready tohear prayer; how willing to find a reason to be gracious; else he wouldnot look so far back as the ancient covenant Israel had so oftenbroken, and forfeited. Let this invite and engage us for ever to him;and encourage even those who have forsaken him, to return and repent;for there is forgiveness with him, that he may be feared. And if theLord answer the mere cry of distress for temporal relief, much morewill he regard the prayer of faith for spiritual blessings.
2Ki 13:10-19	<br>Jehoash, the king, came to Elisha, to receive his dying counsel andblessing. It may turn much to our spiritual advantage, to attend thesick-beds and death-beds of good men, that we may be encouraged inreligion by the living comforts they have from it in a dying hour.Elisha assured the king of his success; yet he must look up to God fordirection and strength; must reckon his own hands not enough, but goon, in dependence upon Divine aid. The trembling hands of the dyingprophet, as they signified the power of God, gave this arrow more forcethan the hands of the king in his full strength. By contemning thesign, the king lost the thing signified, to the grief of the dyingprophet. It is a trouble to good men, to see those to whom they wishwell, forsake their own mercies, and to see them lose advantagesagainst spiritual enemies.
2Ki 13:20-25	<br>God has many ways to chastise a provoking people. Trouble comessometimes from that point whence we least feared it. The mention ofthis invasion on the death of Elisha, shows that the removal of God'sfaithful prophets is a presage of coming judgments. His dead body was ameans of giving life to another dead body. This miracle was aconfirmation of his prophecies. And it may have reference to Christ, bywhose death and burial, the grave is made a safe and happy passage tolife to all believers. Jehoash was successful against the Syrians, justas often as he had struck the ground with the arrows, then a stop wasput to his victories. Many have repented, when too late, of distrustsand the straitness of their desires.
2Ki 14:1-7	<br>Amaziah began well, but did not go on so. It is not enough to do thatwhich our pious predecessors did, merely to keep up the common usage,but we must do it as they did, from the same principle of faith anddevotion, and with the same sincerity and resolution.
2Ki 14:8-14	<br>For some time after the division of the kingdoms, Judah suffered muchfrom the enmity of Israel. After Asa's time, it suffered more by thefriendship of Israel, and by the alliance made with them. Now we meetwith hostility between them again. How may a humble man smile to heartwo proud and scornful men set their wits on work, to vilify andundervalue one another! Unholy success excites pride; pride excitescontentions. The effects of pride in others, are insufferable to thosewho are proud themselves. These are the sources of trouble and sin inprivate life; but when they arise between princes, they become themisery of their whole kingdoms. Jehoash shows Amaziah the folly of hischallenge; Thine heart has lifted thee up. The root of all sin is inthe heart, thence it flows. It is not Providence, the event, theoccasion, whatever it is, that makes men proud, secure, discontented,or the like, but their own hearts do it. (2Ki 14:15-22)
2Ki 14:15-22	<br>Amaziah survived his conqueror fifteen years. He was slain by his ownsubjects. Azariah, or Uzziah, seems to have been very young when hisfather was slain. Though the years of his reign are reckoned from thatevent, he was not fully made king till eleven years afterwards.
2Ki 14:23-29	<br>God raised up the prophet Jonah, and by him declared the purposes ofhis favour to Israel. It is a sign that God has not cast off hispeople, if he continues faithful ministers among them. Two reasons aregiven why God blessed them with those victories: 1. Because thedistress was very great, which made them objects of his compassion. 2.Because the decree was not yet gone forth for their destruction. Manyprophets there had been in Israel, but none left prophecies in writingtill this age, and their prophecies are part of the Bible. Hosea beganto prophesy in the reign of this Jeroboam. At the same time Amosprophesied; soon after Micah, then Isaiah, in the days of Ahaz andHezekiah. Thus God, in the darkest and most degenerate ages of thechurch, raised up some to be burning and shining lights in it; to theirown age, by their preaching and living, and a few by their writings, toreflect light upon us in the last times.
2Ki 15:1-7	<br>Uzziah did for the most part that which was right. It was happy for thekingdom that a good reign was a long one.
2Ki 15:8-31	<br>This history shows Israel in confusion. Though Judah was not withouttroubles, yet that kingdom was happy, compared with the state ofIsrael. The imperfections of true believers are very different from theallowed wickedness of ungodly men. Such is human nature, such are ourhearts, if left to themselves, deceitful above all things, anddesperately wicked. We have reason to be thankful for restraints, forbeing kept out of temptation, and should beg of God to renew a rightspirit within us.
2Ki 15:32-38	<br>Jotham showed great respect to the temple. If magistrates cannot do allthey would, for the suppressing of vice and profaneness, let them dothe more to support and advance piety and virtue.
2Ki 16:1-9	<br>Few and evil were the days of Ahaz. Those whose hearts condemn them,will go any where in a day of distress, rather than to God. The sin wasits own punishment. It is common for those who bring themselves intostraits by one sin, to try to help themselves out by another.
2Ki 16:10-16	<br>God's altar had hitherto been kept in its place, and in use; but Ahazput another in the room of it. The natural regard of the mind of man tosome sort of religion, is not easily extinguished; but except it beregulated by the word, and by the Spirit of God, it produces absurdsuperstitions, or detestable idolatries. Or, at best, it quiets thesinner's conscience with unmeaning ceremonies. Infidels have often beenremarkable for believing ridiculous falsehoods.
2Ki 16:17-20	<br>Ahaz put contempt upon the sabbath, and thus opened a wide inlet to allmanner of sin. This he did for the king of Assyria. When those who havehad a ready passage to the house of the Lord, turn it another way toplease their neighbours, they are going down-hill apace to ruin.
2Ki 17:1-6	<br>When the measure of sin is filled up, the Lord will forbear no longer.The inhabitants of Samaria must have endured great affliction. Some ofthe poor Israelites were left in the land. Those who were carriedcaptives to a great distance, were mostly lost among the nations.
2Ki 17:7-23	<br>Though the destruction of the kingdom of the ten tribes was but brieflyrelated, it is in these verses largely commented upon, and the reasonsof it given. It was destruction from the Almighty: the Assyrian was butthe rod of his anger, Isa 10:5. Those that bring sin into a country orfamily, bring a plague into it, and will have to answer for all themischief that follows. And vast as the outward wickedness of the worldis, the secret sins, evil thoughts, desires, and purposes of mankindare much greater. There are outward sins which are marked by infamy;but ingratitude, neglect, and enmity to God, and the idolatry andimpiety which proceed therefrom, are far more malignant. Withoutturning from every evil way, and keeping God's statutes, there can beno true godliness; but this must spring from belief of his testimony,as to wrath against all ungodliness and unrighteousness, and his mercyin Christ Jesus.
2Ki 17:24-41	<br>The terror of the Almighty will sometimes produce a forced or feignedsubmission in unconverted men; like those brought from differentcountries to inhabit Israel. But such will form unworthy thoughts ofGod, will expect to please him by outward forms, and will vainly try toreconcile his service with the love of the world and the indulgence oftheir lusts. May that fear of the Lord, which is the beginning ofwisdom, possess our hearts, and influence our conduct, that we may beready for every change. Wordly settlements are uncertain; we know notwhither we may be driven before we die, and we must soon leave theworld; but the righteous hath chosen that good part which shall not betaken from him.
2Ki 18:1-8	<br>Hezekiah was a true son of David. Some others did that which was right,but not like David. Let us not suppose that when times and men are bad,they must needs grow worse and worse; that does not follow: after manybad kings, God raised one up like David himself. The brazen serpent hadbeen carefully preserved, as a memorial of God's goodness to theirfathers in the wilderness; but it was idle and wicked to burn incenseto it. All helps to devotion, not warranted by the word of God,interrupt the exercise of faith; they always lead to superstition andother dangerous evils. Human nature perverts every thing of this kind.True faith needs not such aids; the word of God, daily thought upon andprayed over, is all the outward help we need.
2Ki 18:9-16	<br>The descent Sennacherib made upon Judah, was a great calamity to thatkingdom, by which God would try the faith of Hezekiah, and chastise thepeople. The secret dislike, the hypocrisy, and lukewarmness of numbers,require correction; such trials purify the faith and hope of theupright, and bring them to simple dependence on God.
2Ki 18:17-37	<br>Rabshakeh tries to convince the Jews, that it was to no purpose forthem to stand it out. What confidence is this wherein thou trustest? Itwere well if sinners would submit to the force of this argument, inseeking peace with God. It is, therefore, our wisdom to yield to him,because it is in vain to contend with him: what confidence is thatwhich those trust in who stand out against him? A great deal of artthere is in this speech of Rabshakeh; but a great deal of pride,malice, falsehood, and blasphemy. Hezekiah's nobles held their peace.There is a time to keep silence, as well as a time to speak; and thereare those to whom to offer any thing religious or rational, is to castpearls before swine. Their silence made Rabshakeh yet more proud andsecure. It is often best to leave such persons to rail and blaspheme; adecided expression of abhorrence is the best testimony against them.The matter must be left to the Lord, who has all hearts in his hands,committing ourselves unto him in humble submission, believing hope, andfervent prayer.
2Ki 19:1-7	<br>Hezekiah discovered deep concern at the dishonour done to God byRabshakeh's blasphemy. Those who speak from God to us, we should in aparticular manner desire to speak to God for us. The great Prophet isthe great Intercessor. Those are likely to prevail with God, who liftup their hearts in prayer. Man's extremity is God's opportunity. Whilehis servants can speak nothing but terror to the profane, the proud,and the hypocritical, they have comfortable words for the discouragedbeliever.
2Ki 19:8-19	<br>Prayer is the never-failing resource of the tempted Christian, whetherstruggling with outward difficulties or inward foes. At the mercy-seatof his almighty Friend he opens his heart, spreads his case, likeHezekiah, and makes his appeal. When he can discern that the glory ofGod is engaged on his side, faith gains the victory, and he rejoicesthat he shall never be moved. The best pleas in prayer are taken fromGod's honour. (2Ki 19:20-34)
2Ki 19:20-34	<br>All Sennacherib's motions were under the Divine cognizance. God himselfundertakes to defend the city; and that person, that place, cannot butbe safe, which he undertakes to protect. The invasion of the Assyriansprobably had prevented the land from being sown that year. The next issupposed to have been the sabbatical year, but the Lord engaged thatthe produce of the land should be sufficient for their support duringthose two years. As the performance of this promise was to be after thedestruction of Sennacherib's army, it was a sign to Hezekiah's faith,assuring him of that present deliverance, as an earnest of the Lord'sfuture care of the kingdom of Judah. This the Lord would perform, notfor their righteousness, but his own glory. May our hearts be as goodground, that his word may strike root therein, and bring forth fruit inour lives.
2Ki 19:35-37	<br>That night which followed the sending of this message to Hezekiah, themain body of their army was slain. See how weak the mightiest men arebefore Almighty God. Who ever hardened himself against Him andprospered? The king of Assyria's own sons became his murderers. Thosewhose children are undutiful, ought to consider whether they have notbeen so to their Father in heaven? This history exhibits a strong proofof the good of firm trust and confidence in God. He will afflict, butnot forsake his people. It is well when our troubles drive us to ourknees. But does it not reprove our unbelief? How unwilling are we torest on the declaration of Jehovah! How desirous to know in what way hewill save us! How impatient when relief is delayed! But we must waitfor the fulfilling of his word. Lord, help our unbelief.
2Ki 20:1-11	<br>Hezekiah was sick unto death, in the same year in which the king ofAssyria besieged Jerusalem. A warning to prepare for death was broughtto Hezekiah by Isaiah. Prayer is one of the best preparations fordeath, because by it we fetch in strength and grace from God, to enableus to finish well. He wept sorely: some gather from hence that he wasunwilling to die; it is in the nature of man to dread the separation ofsoul and body. There was also something peculiar in Hezekiah's case; hewas now in the midst of his usefulness. Let Hezekiah's prayer, see Isa38. interpret his tears; in that is nothing which is like his havingbeen under that fear of death, which has bondage or torment. Hezekiah'spiety made his sick-bed easy. "O Lord, remember now;" he does not speakas if God needed to be put in mind of any thing by us; nor, as if thereward might be demanded as due; it is Christ's righteousness only thatis the purchase of mercy and grace. Hezekiah does not pray, Lord, spareme; but, Lord, remember me; whether I live or die, let me be thine. Godalways hears the prayers of the broken in heart, and will give health,length of days, and temporal deliverances, as much and as long as istruly good for them. Means were to be used for Hezekiah's recovery;yet, considering to what a height the disease was come, and howsuddenly it was checked, the cure was miraculous. It is our duty, whensick, to use such means as are proper to help nature, else we do nottrust God, but tempt him. For the confirmation of his faith, the shadowof the sun was carried back, and the light was continued longer thanusual, in a miraculous manner. This work of wonder shows the power ofGod in heaven as well as on earth, the great notice he takes of prayer,and the great favour he bears to his chosen.
2Ki 20:12-21	<br>The king of Babylon was at this time independent of the king ofAssyria, though shortly after subdued by him. Hezekiah showed histreasures and armour, and other proofs of his wealth and power. Thiswas the effect of pride and ostentation, and departing from simplereliance on God. He also seems to have missed the opportunity ofspeaking to the Chaldeans, about Him who had wrought the miracles whichexcited their attention, and of pointing out to them the absurdity andevil of idolatry. What is more common than to show our friends ourhouses and possessions? But if we do this in the pride of ours hearts,to gain applause from men, not giving praise to God, it becomes sin inus, as it did in Hezekiah. We may expect vexation from every objectwith which we are unduly pleased. Isaiah, who had often been Hezekiah'scomforter, is now is reprover. The blessed Spirit is both, Joh 16:7,8.Ministers must be both, as there is occasion. Hezekiah allowed thejustice of the sentence, and God's goodness in the respite. Yet theprospect respecting his family and nation must have given him manypainful feelings. Hezekiah was indeed humbled for the pride of hisheart. And blessed are the dead who die in the Lord; for they rest fromtheir labours, and their works do follow them.
2Ki 21:1-9	<br>Young persons generally desire to become their own masters, and to haveearly possession of riches and power. But this, for the most part,ruins their future comfort, and causes mischief to others. It is muchhappier when young persons are sheltered under the care of parents orguardians, till age gives experience and discretion. Though such youngpersons are less indulged, they will afterwards be thankful. Manassehwrought much wickedness in the sight of the Lord, as if on purpose toprovoke him to anger; he did more evil than the nations whom the Lorddestroyed. Manasseh went on from bad to worse, till carried captive toBabylon. The people were ready to comply with his wishes, to obtain hisfavour and because it suited their depraved inclinations. In thereformation of large bodies, numbers are mere time-servers, and intemptation fall away.
2Ki 21:10-18	<br>Here is the doom of Judah and Jerusalem. The words used represent thecity emptied and utterly desolate, yet not destroyed thereby, butcleansed, and to be kept for the future dwelling of the Jews: forsaken,yet not finally, and only as to outward privileges, for individualbelievers were preserved in that visitation. The Lord will cast off anyprofessing people who dishonour him by their crimes, but never willdesert his cause on earth. In the book of Chronicles we read ofManasseh's repentance, and acceptance with God; thus we may learn notto despair of the recovery of the greatest sinners. But let none dareto persist in sin, presuming that they may repent and reform when theyplease. There are a few instances of the conversion of notorioussinners, that none may despair; and but few, that none may presume.
2Ki 21:19-26	<br>Amon profaned God's house with his idols; and God suffered his house tobe polluted with his blood. How unrighteous soever they were that didit, God was righteous who suffered it to be done. Now was a happychange from one of the worst, to one of the best of the kings of Judah.Once more Judah was tried with a reformation. Whether the Lord bearslong with presumptuous offenders, or speedily cuts them off in theirsins, all must perish who persist in refusing to walk in his ways.
2Ki 22:1-10	<br>The different event of Josiah's early succession from that of Manasseh,must be ascribed to the distinguishing grace of God; yet probably thepersons that trained him up were instruments in producing thisdifference. His character was most excellent. Had the people joined inthe reformation as heartily as he persevered in it, blessed effectswould have followed. But they were wicked, and had become fools inidolatry. We do not obtain full knowledge of the state of Judah fromthe historical records, unless we refer to the writings of the prophetswho lived at the time. In repairing the temple, the book of the law wasfound, and brought to the king. It seems, this book of the law was lostand missing; carelessly mislaid and neglected, as some throw theirBibles into corners, or maliciously concealed by some of the idolaters.God's care of the Bible plainly shows his interest in it. Whether thiswas the only copy in being or not, the things contained in it were new,both to the king and to the high priest. No summaries, extracts, orcollections out of the Bible, can convey and preserve the knowledge ofGod and his will, like the Bible itself. It was no marvel that thepeople were so corrupt, when the book of the law was so scarce; theythat corrupted them, no doubt, used arts to get that book out of theirhands. The abundance of Bibles we possess aggravates our national sins;for what greater contempt of God can we show, than to refuse to readhis word when put into our hands, or, reading it, not to believe andobey it? By the holy law is the knowledge of sin, and by the blessedgospel is the knowledge of salvation. When the former is understood inits strictness and excellence, the sinner begins to inquire, What mustI do to be saved? And the ministers of the gospel point out to himJesus Christ, as the end of the law for righteousness to every one thatbelieveth.
2Ki 22:11-20	<br>The book of the law is read before the king. Those best honour theirBibles, who study them; daily feed on that bread, and walk by thatlight. Convictions of sin and wrath should put us upon this inquiry,What shall we do to be saved? Also, what we may expect, and mustprovide for. Those who are truly apprehensive of the weight of God'swrath, cannot but be very anxious how they may be saved. Huldah letJosiah know what judgments God had in store for Judah and Jerusalem.The generality of the people were hardened, and their hearts unhumbled,but Josiah's heart was tender. This is tenderness of heart, and thus hehumbled himself before the Lord. Those who most fear God's wrath, areleast likely to feel it. Though Josiah was mortally wounded in battle,yet he died in peace with God, and went to glory. Whatever such personssuffer or witness, they are gathered to the grave in peace, and shallenter into the rest which remaineth for the people of God.
2Ki 23:1-3	<br>Josiah had received a message from God, that there was no preventingthe ruin of Jerusalem, but that he should only deliver his own soul;yet he does his duty, and leaves the event to God. He engaged thepeople in the most solemn manner to abolish idolatry, and to serve Godin righteousness and true holiness. Though most were formal orhypocritical herein, yet much outward wickedness would be prevented,and they were accountable to God for their own conduct.
2Ki 23:4-14	<br>What abundance of wickedness in Judah and Jerusalem! One would not havebelieved it possible, that in Judah, where God was known, in Israel,where his name was great, in Salem, in Zion, where his dwelling-placewas, such abominations should be found. Josiah had reigned eighteenyears, and had himself set the people a good example, and kept upreligion according to the Divine law; yet, when he came to search foridolatry, the depth and extent were very great. Both common history,and the records of God's word, teach, that all the real godliness orgoodness ever found on earth, is derived from the new-creating Spiritof Jesus Christ.
2Ki 23:15-24	<br>Josiah's zeal extended to the cities of Israel within his reach. Hecarefully preserved the sepulchre of that man of God, who came fromJudah to foretell the throwing down of Jeroboam's altar. When they hadcleared the country of the old leaven of idolatry, then they appliedthemselves to the keeping of the feast. There was not holden such apassover in any of the foregoing reigns. The revival of along-neglected ordinance, filled them with holy joy; and Godrecompensed their zeal in destroying idolatry with uncommon tokens ofhis presence and favour. We have reason to think that during theremainder of Josiah's reign, religion flourished.
2Ki 23:25-30	<br>Upon reading these verses, we must say, Lord, though thy righteousnessbe as the great mountains, evident, plainly to be seen, and pastdispute; yet thy judgments are a great deep, unfathomable, and pastfinding out. The reforming king is cut off in the midst of hisusefulness, in mercy to him, that he might not see the evil coming uponhis kingdom: but in wrath to his people, for his death was an inlet totheir desolations. (2Ki 23:31-37)
2Ki 23:31-37	<br>After Josiah was laid in his grave, one trouble came on another, till,in twenty-two years, Jerusalem was destroyed. The wicked perished ingreat numbers, the remnant were purified, and Josiah's reformation hadraised up some to join the few who were the precious seed of theirfuture church and nation. A little time, and slender abilities, oftensuffice to undo the good which pious men have, for a course of years,been labouring to effect. But, blessed be God, the good work which hebegins by his regenerating Spirit, cannot be done away, but withstandsall changes and temptations.
2Ki 24:1-7	<br>If Jehoiakim had served the Lord, he had not been servant toNebuchadnezzar. If he had been content with his servitude, and true tohis word, his condition had been no worse; but, rebelling againstBabylon, he plunged himself into more trouble. See what need nationshave to lament the sins of their fathers, lest they smart for them.Threatenings will be fulfilled as certainly as promises, if thesinner's repentance prevent not. (2Ki 24:8-20)
2Ki 24:8-20	<br>Jehoiachin reigned but three months, yet long enough to show that hejustly smarted for his fathers' sins, for he trod in their steps. Hisuncle was intrusted with the government. This Zedekiah was the last ofthe kings of Judah. Though the judgments of God upon the three kingsbefore him might have warned him, he did that which was evil, likethem. When those intrusted with the counsels of a nation act unwisely,and against their true interest, we ought to notice the displeasure ofGod in it. It is for the sins of a people that God hides from them thethings that belong to the public peace. And in fulfilling the secretpurposes of his justice, the Lord needs only leave men to the blindnessof their own minds, or to the lusts of their own hearts. The gradualapproach of Divine judgments affords sinners space for repentance, andbelievers leisure to prepare for meeting the calamity, while it showsthe obstinacy of those who will not forsake their sins.
2Ki 25:1-7	<br>Jerusalem was so fortified, that it could not be taken till faminerendered the besieged unable to resist. In the prophecy andLamentations of Jeremiah, we find more of this event; here it sufficesto say, that the impiety and misery of the besieged were very great. Atlength the city was taken by storm. The king, his family, and his greatmen escaped in the night, by secret passages. But those deceivethemselves who think to escape God's judgments, as much as those whothink to brave them. By what befell Zedekiah, two prophecies, whichseemed to contradict each other, were both fulfilled. Jeremiahprophesied that Zedekiah should be brought to Babylon, Jer 32:5; 34:3;Ezekiel, that he should not see Babylon, Eze 12:13. He was broughtthither, but his eyes being put out, he did not see it.
2Ki 25:8-21	<br>The city and temple were burnt, and, it is probable, the ark in it. Bythis, God showed how little he cares for the outward pomp of hisworship, when the life and power of religion are neglected. The wallsof Jerusalem were thrown down, and the people carried captive toBabylon. The vessels of the temple were carried away. When the thingssignified were sinned away, what should the signs stand there for? Itwas righteous with God to deprive those of the benefit of his worship,who had preferred false worships before it; those that would have manyaltars, now shall have none. As the Lord spared not the angels thatsinned, as he doomed the whole race of fallen men to the grave, and allunbelievers to hell, and as he spared not his own Son, but deliveredhim up for us all, we need not wonder at any miseries he may bring uponguilty nations, churches, or persons.
2Ki 25:22-30	<br>The king of Babylon appointed Gedaliah to be the governor and protectorof the Jews left their land. But the things of their peace were sohidden from their eyes, that they knew not when they were well off.Ishmael basely slew him and all his friends, and, against the counselof Jeremiah, the rest went to Egypt. Thus was a full end made of themby their own folly and disobedience; see Jeremiah chap. 40 to 45Jehoiachin was released out of prison, where he had been kept 37 years.Let none say that they shall never see good again, because they havelong seen little but evil: the most miserable know not what turnProvidence may yet give to their affairs, nor what comforts they arereserved for, according to the days wherein they have been afflicted.Even in this world the Saviour brings a release from bondage to thedistressed sinner who seeks him, bestowing foretastes of the pleasureswhich are at his right hand for evermore. Sin alone can hurt us; Jesusalone can do good to sinners.
1Ch 1:1-27	<br>This chapter, and many that follow, repeat the genealogies, or lists offathers and children in the Bible history, and put them together, withmany added. When compared with other places, there are some differencesfound; yet we must not therefore stumble at the word, but bless Godthat the things necessary to salvation are plain enough. The originalof the Jewish nation is here traced from the first man that Godcreated, and is thereby distinguished from the obscure, fabulous, andabsurd origins assigned to other nations. But the nations now are allso mingled with one another, that no one nation, nor the greatest partof any, is descended entirely from any of one nation, nor the greatestpart of any, is descended entirely from any of these fountains. Onlythis we are sure of, that God has created of one blood all nations ofmen; they are all descended from one Adam, one Noah. Have we not allone father? Has not one God created us? Mal 2:10.
1Ch 1:28-54	<br>The genealogy is from hence confined to the posterity of Abraham. Letus take occasion from reading these lists of names, to think of themultitudes that have gone through this world, have done their parts init, and then quitted it. As one generation, even of sinful men, passesaway, another comes. Ec 1:4; Nu 32:14, and will do so while the earthremains. Short is our passage through time into eternity. May we bedistinguished as the Lord's people.
1Ch 11:1-9	<br>David was brought to possess the throne of Israel after he had reignedseven years in Hebron, over Judah only. God's counsels will befulfilled at last, whatever difficulties lie in the way. The way to betruly great, is to be really useful, to devote all our talents to theLord.
1Ch 11:10-47	<br>An account is given of David's worthies, the great men who served him.Yet David reckoned his success, not as from the mighty men that werewith him, but from the mighty God, whose presence is all in all. Instrengthening him, they strengthened themselves and their own interest,for his advancement was theirs. We shall gain by what we do in ourplaces for the support of the kingdom of the Son of David; and thosethat are faithful to Him, shall find their names registered much moreto their honour, than these are in the records of fame.
1Ch 12:1-22	<br>Here is an account of those who appeared and acted as David's friends,while he was persecuted. No difficulties or dangers should keep thesinner from coming to the Savior, nor drive the believer from the pathof duty. Those who break through, and overcome in these attempts, willfind abundant recompence. From the words of Amasai we may learn how totestify our affection and allegiance to the Lord Jesus; his we must bethroughly; on his side we must be forward to appear and act. If we areunder the influence of the Spirit, we shall desire to have our lotamong them, and to declare ourselves on their side; if in faith andlove we embrace the cause of Christ, he will receive, employ, andadvance us.
1Ch 12:23-40	<br>When the throne of Christ is set up in a soul, there is, or ought tobe, great joy in that soul; and provision is made, not as here, for afew days, but for the whole life, and for eternity. Happy are those whowisely perceive it to be their duty and interest, to submit to theSaviour Jesus Christ, the Son of David; who renounce for his sake allthat is not consistent; whose earnest endeavours to do good aredirected by the wisdom that God giveth, through acquaintance with hisword, experience, and observation. If any man lack this wisdom, let himask it of God, who giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not, andit shall be given him.
1Ch 13:1-5	<br>David said not, What magnificent thing shall I do now? or, Whatpleasant thing? but, What pious thing? that he might have the comfortand benefit of that sacred oracle. Let us bring the ark to us, that itmay be a blessing to us. Those who honour God, profit themselves. It isthe wisdom of those setting out in the world, to take God's ark withthem. Those are likely to go on in the favour of God, who begin in thefear of God. (1Ch 13:6-14)
1Ch 13:6-14	<br>Let the sin of Uzza warn all to take heed of presumption, rashness, andirreverence, in dealing with holy things; and let none think that agood design will justify a bad action. Let the punishment of Uzza teachus not to dare to trifle with God in our approaches to him; yet let us,through Christ, come boldly to the throne of grace. If the gospel be tosome a savour of death unto death, as the ark was to Uzza, yet let usreceive it in the love of it, and it will be to us a savour of lifeunto life.
1Ch 15:1-24	<br>Wise and good men may be guilty of oversights, which they will correct,as soon as they are aware of them. David does not try to justify whathad been done amiss, nor to lay the blame on others; but he ownshimself guilty, with others, of not seeking God in due order
1Ch 15:25-29	<br>It is good to notice the assistance of Divine Providence, even inthings which fall within the compass of our natural powers; if God didnot help us, we could not stir a step. If we do our religious duties inany degree aright, we must own it was God that helped us; had we beenleft to ourselves, we should have been guilty of some fatal errors. Andevery thing in which we engage, must be done in dependence on the mercyof God through the sacrifice of the Redeemer.
1Ch 16:1-6	<br>Though God's word and ordinances may be clouded and eclipsed for atime, they shall shine out of obscurity. This was but a tent, a humbledwelling, yet this was the tabernacle which David, in his psalms, oftenspeaks of with so much affection. David showed himself generous to hissubjects, as he had found God gracious to him. Those whose hearts areenlarged with holy joy, should show it by being open-handed.
1Ch 16:7-36	<br>Let God be glorified in our praises. Let others be edified and taught,that strangers to him may be led to adore him. Let us ourselves triumphand trust in God. Those that give glory to God's name are allowed toglory in it. Let the everlasting covenant be the great matter of ourjoy his people of old, be remembered by us with thankfulness to him.Show forth from day to day his salvation, his promised salvation byChrist. We have reason to celebrate that from day to day; for we dailyreceive the benefit, and it is a subject that can never be exhausted.In the midst of praises, we must not forget to pray for the servants ofGod in distress.
1Ch 16:37-43	<br>The worship of God ought to be the work of every day. David put it intoorder. At Jerusalem, where the ark was, Asaph and his brethren were tominister before the ark continually, with songs of praise. Nosacrifices were offered there, nor incense burnt, because the altarswere not there; but David's prayers were directed as incense, and thelifting up of his hands as the evening sacrifice. So early didspiritual worship take place of ceremonial. Yet the ceremonial worship,being of Divine institution, must by no means be omitted; therefore atGibeon, at the altars, the priests attended; for their work was tosacrifice and burn incense; and that they did continually, morning andevening, according to the law of Moses. As the ceremonies were types ofthe mediation of Christ, the observance of them was of greatconsequence. The attendance of his appointed ministers is right initself, and encourages the people.
1Ch 17:19	<br>JesusChrist is both the Word of God, Re 19:13, and the Servant of God, Isa42:1; and it is for his sake, upon account of his mediation, that thepromises are made good to all believers; it is in him, that they areyea and amen. For His sake it is done, for his sake it is made known;to him we owe all this greatness, from him we are to expect all thesegreat things. They are the unsearchable riches of Christ, which, if byfaith we see in themselves, and see in the Lord Jesus, we cannot butmagnify as the only true greatness, and speak honourably of them. Forthis blessedness may we look amidst the trials of life, and when wefeel the hand of death upon us; and seek it for our children after us.
1Ch 22:1-5	<br>On occasion of the terrible judgment inflicted on Israel for the sin ofDavid, God pointed out the place where he would have the temple built;upon which, David was excited to make preparations for the great work.David must not build, but he would do all he could; he preparedabundantly before his death. What our hands find to do for God, and oursouls, and those round us, let us do it with all our might, before ourdeath; for after death there is no device nor working. And when theLord refuses to employ us in those services which we desired, we mustnot be discouraged or idle, but do what we can, though in a humblersphere.
1Ch 22:6-16	<br>David gives Solomon the reason why he should build the temple. BecauseGod named him. Nothing is more powerful to engage us in any service forGod, than to know that we are appointed thereto. Because he would haveleisure and opportunity to do it. He should have peace and quietness.Where God gives rest, he expects work. Because God had promised toestablish his kingdom. God's gracious promises should quicken andstrengthen our religious service. David delivered to Solomon an accountof the vast preparations he had made for this building; not from prideand vain-glory, but to encourage Solomon to engage cheerfully in thegreat work. He must not think, by building the temple, to purchase adispensation to sin; on the contrary, his doing that would not beaccepted, if he did not take heed to fulfil the statutes of the Lord.In our spiritual work, as well as in our spiritual warfare, we haveneed of courage and resolution. (1Ch 22:17-19)
1Ch 22:17-19	<br>Whatever is done towards rendering the word of God generally known andattended to, is like bringing a stone, or an ingot of gold, towardserecting the temple. This should encourage us when we grieve that we donot see more fruit of our labours; much good may appear after ourdeath, which we never thought of. Let us not then be weary of welldoing. The work is in the hands of the Prince of peace. As he, theAuthor and Finisher of the work, is pleased to employ us as hisinstruments, let us arise and be doing, encouraging and helping oneanother; working by his rule, after his example, in dependence on hisgrace, assured that he will be with us, and that our labour shall notbe in vain in the Lord.
1Ch 23:1-23	<br>David, having given charge concerning the building of the temple,settles the method of the temple service, and orders the officers ofit. When those of the same family were employed together, it wouldengage them to love and assist one another.
1Ch 23:24-32	<br>Now the people of Israel were so many, there should be more employed inthe temple service, that every Israelite who brought an offering mightfind a Levite ready to help him. When more work is to be done, it ispity but there should be more workmen. A new heart, a spiritual mind,which delights greatly in God's commandments, and can find a refreshingfeast in his ordinances, forms the great distinction between the trueChristian and all other men in the world. To the spiritual man everyservice will yield satisfaction. He will be ever abounding in the workof the Lord; being never so happy as when employed for such a goodMaster, in so pleasant a service. He will not regard whether he iscalled to take the lead, or to keep the charge of others who are placedover him. May we seek and serve the Lord uprightly, and leave all therest to his disposal, by faith in his word.
1Ch 27:1-15	<br>In the kingdoms of this world readiness for war forms a security forpeace; in like manner, nothing so much encourages Satan's assaults asto be unwatchful. So long as we stand armed with the whole armour ofGod, in the exercise of faith, and preparation of heart for theconflict, we shall certainly be safe, and probably enjoy inward peace.
1Ch 27:16-34	<br>The officers of the court, or the rulers of the king's substance, hadthe oversight and charge of the king's tillage, his vineyards, hisherds, his flocks, which formed the wealth of eastern kings. Much ofthe wisdom of princes is seen in the choice of their ministry, andcommon persons show it in the choice of their advisers. David, thoughhe had all these about him, preferred the word of God before them all.Thy testimonies are my delight and my counsellors.
1Ch 28:1-10	<br>During David's last sickness, many chief priests and Levites were atJerusalem. Finding himself able, David spoke of his purpose to build atemple for God, and of God's disallowing that purpose. He opened tothem God's gracious purposes concerning Solomon. David charged them tocleave stedfastly to God and their duty. We cannot do our work as weshould, unless we put on resolution, and fetch in strength from Divinegrace. Religion or piety has two distinct parts. The first is knowledgeof God, the second is worship of God. David says, Know thou the God ofthy father, and serve him with a perfect heart and a willing mind. Godis made known by his works and word. Revelation alone shows the wholecharacter of God, in his providence, his holy law, his condemnation ofsinners, his blessed gospel, and the ministration of the Spirit to alltrue believers. The natural man cannot receive this knowledge of God.But thus we learn the value of the Saviour's atonement, and of thesanctification of the Holy Spirit, and are influenced to walk in allhis commandments. It brings a sinner to his proper place at the foot ofthe cross, as a poor, guilty, helpless worm, deserving wrath, yetexpecting every thing needful from the free mercy and grace of God ourFather, and the Lord Jesus Christ. Having been forgiven much, thepardoned sinner learns to love much.
1Ch 28:11-21	<br>The temple must be a sacred thing, and a type of Christ; it must beframed by Divine teaching. Christ is the true temple, the church is thegospel temple, and heaven the everlasting temple; all are framedaccording to the Divine counsels, and the plan laid in the Divinewisdom, ordained before the world, for God's glory and our good. Davidgave this pattern to Solomon, that he might go by rule. Materials wereprovided for the most costly utensils of the temple. Directions weregiven which way to look for help in this great undertaking. Be notdismayed; God will help thee, and thou must look up to him in the firstplace. We may be sure that God, who owned our fathers, and carried themthrough the services of their day, will, in like manner, never leaveus, while he has any work to do in us, or by us. Good work is likely togo on, when all concerned are hearty in furthering it. Let us hope inGod's mercy; if we seek him, he will be found of us.
1Ch 29:1-9	<br>What is done in works of piety and charity, should be done willingly,not by constraint; for God loves a cheerful giver. David set a goodexample. This David offered, not from constraint, or for show; butbecause he had set his affection to the house of God, and thought hecould never do enough towards promoting that good work. Those who woulddraw others to good, must lead the way themselves.
1Ch 29:10-19	<br>We cannot form a right idea of the magnificence of the temple, and thebuildings around it, about which such quantities of gold and silverwere employed. But the unsearchable riches of Christ exceed thesplendour of the temple, infinitely more than that surpassed themeanest cottage on earth. Instead of boasting of these large oblations,David gave solemn thanks to the Lord. All they gave for the Lord'stemple was his own; if they attempted to keep it, death would soon haveremoved them from it. The only use they could make of it to their realadvantage, was, to consecrate it to the service of Him who gave it.
1Ch 29:20-25	<br>This great assembly joined with David in adoring God. Whoever is themouth of the congregation, those only have the benefit who join him,not by bowing down the head, so much as by lifting up the soul. Solomonsat on the throne of the Lord. Solomon's kingdom typified the kingdomof the Messiah, whose throne is the throne of the Lord.
1Ch 29:26-30	<br>When we read the second book of Samuel, we could scarcely have expectedto behold David appear so illustrious in his closing scene. But hisrepentance had been as remarkable as his sin; and his conduct duringhis afflictions, and towards the end of his life, appears to have had agood effect on his subjects. Blessed be God, even the chief of sinnersmay hope for a glorious departure, when brought to repent and flee forrefuge to the Saviour's atoning blood. Let us mark the differencebetween the spirit and character of the man after God's own heart,living and dying, and those of worthless professors, who resemble himin nothing but their sins, and who wickedly try to excuse their crimesby his sins. Let us watch and pray, lest we be overcome by temptation,and overtaken by sin, to the dishonour of God, and the wounding of ourown consciences. When we feel that we have offended, let us followDavid's example of repentance and patience, looking for a gloriousresurrection, through our Lord Jesus Christ.
2Ch 5:1-10	<br>The ark was a type of Christ, and, as such, a token of the presence ofGod. That gracious promise, Lo, I am with you alway, even unto the endof the world, does, in effect, bring the ark into our religiousassemblies, if we by faith and prayer plead that promise; and this weshould be most earnest for. When Christ is formed in a soul, the lawwritten in the heart, the ark of the covenant settled there, so that itbecomes the temple of the Holy Ghost, there is true satisfaction inthat soul.
2Ch 5:11-14	<br>God took possession of the temple; he filled it with a cloud. Thus hesignified his acceptance of this temple, to be the same to him that thetabernacle of Moses was, and assured his people that he would be thesame in it. Would we have God dwell in our hearts, we must leave roomfor him; every thing else must give way. The Word was made flesh; andwhen he comes to his temple, like a refiner's fire, who may abide theday of his coming? May he prepare us for that day.
2Ch 9:1-12	<br>This history has been considered, 1Ki 10; yet because our Saviour hasproposed it as an example in seeking after him, Mt 12:42, we must notpass it over without observing, that those who know the worth of truewisdom will grudge no pains or cost to obtain it. The queen of Shebaput herself to a great deal of trouble and expense to hear the wisdomof Solomon; and yet, learning from him to serve God, and do her duty,she thought herself well paid for her pains. Heavenly wisdom is thatpearl of great price, for which, if we part with all, we make a goodbargain.
2Ch 9:13-31	<br>The imports here mentioned, would show that prosperity drew the mindsof Solomon and his subjects to the love of things curious and uncommon,though useless in themselves. True wisdom and happiness are alwaysunited together; but no such alliance exists between wealth and theenjoyment of the things of this life. Let us then acquaint ourselveswith the Saviour, that we may find rest for our souls. Here is Solomonreigning in wealth and power, in ease and fulness, the like of whichcould never since be found; for the most known of the great princes ofthe earth were famed for their wars; whereas Solomon reigned fortyyears in profound peace. The promise was fulfilled, that God would givehim riches and honour, such as no kings have had or shall have. Thelustre wherein he appeared, was typical of the spiritual glory of thekingdom of the Messiah, and but a faint representation of His throne,which is above every throne. Here is Solomon dying, and leaving all hiswealth and power to one who he knew would be a fool! Ec 2:18,19. Thiswas not only vanity, but vexation of spirit. Neither power, wealth, norwisdom, can ward off or prepare for the stroke of death. But thanks beto God who giveth the victory to the true believer, even over thisdreaded enemy, through Jesus Christ our Lord.
2Ch 11:1-12	<br>A few good words might have prevented the rebellion of Rehoboam'ssubjects; but all the force of his kingdom cannot bring them back. Andit is in vain to contend with the purpose of God, when it is made knownto us. Even those who are destitute of true faith, will at times paysome regard to the word of God, and be kept by it from wrong actions,to which they are prone by nature.
2Ch 11:13-23	<br>When the priests and Levites came to Jerusalem, the devout, piousIsraelites followed them. Such as set their hearts to seek the Lord Godof Israel, left the inheritance of their fathers, and went toJerusalem, that they might have free access to the altar of God, and beout of the temptation to worship the calves. That is best for us, whichis best for our souls; in all our choices, religious advantages must besought before all outward conveniences. Where God's faithful priestsare, his faithful people should be. And when it has been proved that weare willing to renounce our worldly interests, so far as we are calledto do so for the sake of Christ and his gospel, we have good evidencethat we are truly his disciples. And it is the interest of a nation toprotect religion and religious people.
2Ch 20:1-13	<br>In all dangers, public or personal, our first business should be toseek help from God. Hence the advantage of days for national fastingand prayer. From the first to the last of our seeking the Lord, we mustapproach him with humiliation for our sins, trusting only in his mercyand power. Jehoshaphat acknowledges the sovereign dominion of theDivine Providence. Lord, exert it on our behalf. Whom should we seekto, whom should we trust to for relief, but the God we have chosen andserved. Those that use what they have for God, may comfortably hope hewill secure it to them. Every true believer is a son of Abraham, afriend of God; with such the everlasting covenant is established, tosuch every promise belongs. We are assured of God's love, by hisdwelling in human nature in the person of the Saviour. Jehoshaphatmentions the temple, as a token of God's favourable presence. He pleadsthe injustice of his enemies. We may well appeal to God against thosethat render us evil for good. Though he had a great army, he said, Wehave no might without thee; we rely upon thee.
2Ch 20:14-19	<br>The Spirit of prophecy came upon a Levite in the midst of thecongregation. The Spirit, like the wind, blows where and on whom Helisteth. He encouraged them to trust in God. Let the Christian soldiergo out against his spiritual enemies, and the God of peace will makehim more than a conqueror. Our trials will prove our gain. Theadvantage will be all our own, but the whole glory must be given toGod.
2Ch 20:20-30	<br>Jehoshaphat exhorted his troops to firm faith in God. Faith inspires aman with true courage; nor will any thing help more to the establishingof the heart in shaking times, than a firm belief of the power, andmercy, and promise of God. In all our trust in the Lord, and ourpraises of him, let us especially look at his everlasting mercy tosinners through Jesus Christ. Never was an army so destroyed as that ofthe enemy. Thus God often makes wicked people destroy one another. Andnever was a victory celebrated with more solemn thanksgivings.
2Ch 20:31-37	<br>Jehoshaphat kept close to the worship of God, and did what he could tokeep his people close to it. But after God had done such great thingsfor him, given him not only victory, but wealth; after this, to go andjoin himself with a wicked king, was very ungrateful. What could heexpect but that God would be angry with him? Yet it seems, he took thewarning; for when Ahaziah afterward pressed him to join him, he wouldnot, 1Ki 22:49. Thus the alliance was broken, and the Divine rebuke hadits effect, at least for a season. Let us be thankful for any losseswhich may have prevented the loss of our immortal souls. Let us praisethe Lord, who sought after us, and left us not to perish in our sins.
2Ch 21:1-11	<br>Jehoram hated his brethren, and slew them, for the same reason thatCain hated Abel, and slew him, because their piety condemned hisimpiety. In the mystery of Providence such men sometimes prosper for atime; but the Lord has righteous purposes in permitting such events,part of which may now be made out, and the rest will be seen hereafter.
2Ch 21:12-20	<br>A warning from God was sent to Jehoram. The Spirit of prophecy mightdirect Elijah to prepare this writing in the foresight of Jehoram'scrimes. He is plainly told that his sin should certainly ruin him. Butno marvel that sinners are not frightened from sin, and to repentance,by the threatenings of misery in another world, when the certainty ofmisery in this world, the sinking of their estates, and the ruin oftheir health, will not restrain them from vicious courses. See Jehoramhere stripped of all his comforts. Thus God plainly showed that thecontroversy was with him, and his house. He had slain all his brethrento strengthen himself; now, all his sons are slain but one. David'shouse must not be wholly destroyed, like those of Israel's kings,because a blessing was in it; that of the Messiah. Good men may beafflicted with diseases; but to them they are fatherly chastisements,and by the support of Divine consolations the soul may dwell at ease,even when the body lies in pain. To be sick and poor, sick andsolitary, but especially to be sick and in sin, sick and under thecurse of God, sick and without grace to bear it, is a most deplorablecase. Wickedness and profaneness make men despicable, even in the eyesof those who have but little religion.
2Ch 24:1-14	<br>Joash is more zealous about the repair of the temple than Jehoiadahimself. It is easier to build temples, than to be temples to God. Butthe repairing of places for public worship is a good work, which allshould promote. And many a good work would be done that now liesundone, if active men would put it forward.
2Ch 24:15-27	<br>See what a great judgment on any prince or people, the death of godly,zealous, useful men is. See how necessary it is that we act in religionfrom inward principle. Then the loss of a parent, a minister, or afriend, will not be losing our religion. Often both princes andinferior people have been flattered to their ruin. True grace alonewill enable a man to bring forth fruit unto the end. Zechariah, the sonof Jehoiada, being filled with the Spirit of prophecy, stood up, andtold the people of their sin. This is the work of ministers, by theword of God, as a lamp and a light, to discover the sin of men, andexpound the providences of God. They stoned Zechariah to death in thecourt of the house of the Lord. Observe the dying martyr's words: TheLord look upon it, and require it! This came not from a spirit ofrevenge, but a spirit of prophecy. God smote Joash with great diseases,of body, or mind, or both, before the Syrians departed from him. Ifvengeance pursue men, the end of one trouble will be but the beginningof another. His own servants slew him. These judgments are called theburdens laid upon him, for the wrath of God is a heavy burden, tooheavy for any man to bear. May God help us to take warning, to beupright in heart, and to persevere in his ways to the end.
2Ch 25:1-13	<br>Amaziah was no enemy to religion, but cool and indifferent friend. Manydo what is good, but not with a perfect heart. Rashness makes work forrepentance. But Amaziah's obedience to the command of God was to hishonour. A firm belief of God's all-sufficiency to bear us out in ourduty, and to make up all the loss and damage we sustain in his service,will make his yoke very easy, and his burden very light. When we arecalled to part with any thing for God and our religion, it shouldsatisfy us, that God is able to give us much more than this. Convincedsinners, who have not true faith, always object to self-denyingobedience. They are like Amaziah; they say, But what shall we do forthe hundred talents? What shall we do if by keeping the sabbath holy welose so many good customers? What shall we do without this gain? Whatshall we do if we lose the friendship of the world? Many endeavour toquiet their consciences by the pretence that forbidden practices arenecessary. The answer is, as here, The Lord is able to give thee muchmore than this. He makes up, even in this world, for all that is givenup for his sake.
2Ch 25:14-16	<br>To worship the gods of those whom Amaziah had conquered, who could nothelp their own worshippers, was the greatest absurdity. If men wouldconsider how unable all those things are to help them, to which theylook whenever they forsake God, they would not be such enemies tothemselves. The reproof God sent by a prophet was too just to beanswered; but he was bidden not to say a word more. The secure sinnerrejoices to have silenced his reprovers and monitors; but what comes ofit? Those that are deaf to reproof, are ripening for destruction.
2Ch 25:17-28	<br>Never was a proud prince more thoroughly mortified than Amaziah byJoash king of Israel. A man's pride will bring him low, Pr 29:23; itgoes before his destruction, and deservedly brings it on. He thatexalteth himself shall be abased. He that goes forth hastily to strive,will not know what he shall do in the end thereof, when his neighbourhas put him to shame, Pr 25:8. And what are we when we offer toestablish our own righteousness, or presume to justify ourselves beforethe Most High God, but despicable thistles, that fancy themselvesstately cedars? And are not various temptations, is not everycorruption, a wild beast of the desert, which will trample on thewretched boaster, and tread his haughty pretensions to the dust? Aman's pride shall bring him low; his ruin may be dated from his turningfrom the Lord.
2Ch 26:1-15	<br>As long as Uzziah sought the Lord, and minded religion, God made him toprosper. Those only prosper whom God makes to prosper; for prosperityis his gift. Many have owned, that as long as they sought the Lord, andkept close to their duty, they prospered; but when they forsook God,every thing went cross. God never continues either to bless theindolent or to withhold his blessing from the diligent. He will neversuffer any to seek his face in vain. Uzziah's name was famed throughoutall the neighbouring countries. A name with God and good people makestruly honourable. He did not delight in war, nor addict himself tosports, but delighted in husbandry.
2Ch 26:16-23	<br>The transgression of the kings before Uzziah was, forsaking the templeof the Lord, and burning incense upon idolatrous altars. But histransgression was, going into the holy place, and attempting to burnincense upon the altar of God. See how hard it is to avoid one extreme,and not run into another. Pride of heart was at the bottom of his sin;a lust that ruins many. Instead of lifting up the name God in gratitudeto him who had done so much for him, his heart was lifted up to hishurt. Men's pretending to forbidden knowledge, and seeking things toohigh for them, are owing to pride of heart. The incense of our prayersmust be, by faith, put into the hands of our Lord Jesus, the great HighPriest of our profession, else we cannot expect it to be accepted byGod, Re 8:3. Though Uzziah strove with the priests, he would not strivewith his Maker. But he was punished for his transgression; he continueda leper to his death, shut out from society. The punishment answeredthe sin as face to face in a glass. Pride was at the bottom of histransgression, and thus God humbled him, and put dishonour upon him.Those that covet forbidden honours, forfeit allowed ones. Adam, bycatching at the tree of knowledge which he might not eat of, debarredhimself of the tree of life which he might have eaten of. Let all thatread say, The Lord is righteous. And when the Lord sees good to throwprosperous and useful men aside, as broken vessels, if he raises upothers to fill their places, they may rejoice to renounce all worldlyconcerns, and employ their remaining days in preparation for death.
2Ch 29:1-19	<br>When Hezekiah came to the crown, he applied at once to work reform.Those who begin with God, begin at the right end of their work, and itwill prosper accordingly. Those that turn their backs upon God'sordinances, may truly be said to forsake God himself. There are stillsuch neglects, if the word be not duly read and opened, for that wassignified by the lighting the lamps, and also if prayers and praise benot offered up, for that was signified by the burning incense. Neglectof God's worship was the cause of the calamities they had lain under.The Lord alone can prepare the heart of man for vital godliness: whenmuch good is done in a little time, the glory must be ascribed to him;and all who love him or the souls of men, will rejoice therein. Letthose that do good work, learn to do it well.
2Ch 29:20-36	<br>As soon as Hezekiah heard that the temple was ready, he lost no time.Atonement must be made for the sins of the last reign. It was notenough to lament and forsake those sins; they brought a sin-offering.Our repentance and reformation will not obtain pardon but in andthrough Christ, who was made sin, that is, a sin-offering for us. Whilethe offerings were on the altar, the Levites sang. Sorrow for sin mustnot prevent us from praising God. The king and the congregation gavetheir consent to all that was done. It is not enough for us to be whereGod is worshipped, if we do not ourselves worship with the heart. Andwe should offer up our spiritual sacrifices of praise and thanksgiving,and devote ourselves and all we have, as sacrifices, acceptable to theFather only through the Redeemer.
2Ch 30:1-12	<br>Hezekiah made Israel as welcome to the passover, as any of his ownsubjects. Let us yield ourselves unto the Lord. Say not, you will dowhat you please, but resolve to do what he pleases. We perceive in thecarnal mind a stiffness, an obstinacy, an unaptness to compel with God;we have it from our fathers: this must be overcome. Those who, throughgrace, have turned to God themselves, should do all they can to bringothers to him. Numbers will be scorners, but some will be humbled andbenefited; perhaps where least expected. The rich mercy of God is thegreat argument by which to enforce repentance; the vilest who submitand yield themselves to the Lord, seek his grace, and give themselvesto his service, shall certainly be saved. Oh that messengers were sentforth to carry these glad tidings to every city and every village,through every land!
2Ch 30:13-20	<br>The great thing needful in attendance upon God in solemn ordinances,is, that we make heart-work of it; all is nothing without this. Wherethis sincerity and fixedness of heart are, there may yet be many thingsshort of the purification of the sanctuary. These defects needpardoning, healing grace; for omissions in duty are sins, as well asomissions of duty. If God should deal with us in strict justice, evenas to the very best of our doings, we should be undone. The way toobtain pardon, is to seek it of God by prayer; it must be gotten bypetition through the blood of Christ. Yet every defect is sin, andneeds forgiveness; and should be matter to humble, but not todiscourage us, though nothing can make up for the want of a heartprepared to seek the Lord.
2Ch 30:21-27	<br>Many prayers were put up to God with the peace-offerings. In theseIsrael looked to God as the God of their fathers, a God in covenantwith them. There was also abundance of good preaching. The Levites readand explained the Scriptures. Faith cometh by hearing, and truereligion preaching has abounded. They sang psalms every day: praisingGod should be much of our work in religious assemblies. Having kept theseven days of the feast in this religious manner, they had so muchcomfort in it, that they kept other seven days also. This they did withgladness. Holy duties should be done with holy gladness. And whensinners humble themselves before the Lord, they may expect gladness inhis ordinances. Those who taste this happiness will not soon grow wearyof it, but will be glad to prolong their enjoyment.
2Ch 32:1-23	<br>Those who trust God with their safety, must use proper means, else theytempt him. God will provide, but so must we also. Hezekiah gathered hispeople together, and spake comfortably to them. A believing confidencein God, will raise us above the prevailing fear of man. Let the goodsubjects and soldiers of Jesus Christ, rest upon his word, and boldlysay, Since God is for us, who can be against us? By the favour of God,enemies are lost, and friends gained.
2Ch 32:24-33	<br>God left Hezekiah to himself, that, by this trial and his weakness init, what was in his heart might be known; that he was not so perfect ingrace as he thought he was. It is good for us to know ourselves, andour own weakness and sinfulness, that we may not be conceited, orself-confident, but may always live in dependence upon Divine grace. Weknow not the corruption of our own hearts, nor what we shall do if Godleaves us to ourselves. His sin was, that his heart was lifted up. Whatneed have great men, and good men, and useful men, to study their owninfirmities and follies, and their obligations to free grace, that theymay never think highly of themselves; but beg earnestly of God, that hewill always keep them humble! Hezekiah made a bad return to God for hisfavours, by making even those favours the food and fuel of his pride.Let us shun the occasions of sin: let us avoid the company, theamusements, the books, yea, the very sights that may administer to sin.Let us commit ourselves continually to God's care and protection; andbeg of him never to leave us nor forsake us. Blessed be God, death willsoon end the believer's conflict; then pride and every sin will beabolished. He will no more be tempted to withhold the praise whichbelongs to the God of his salvation.
2Ch 33:1-20	<br>We have seen Manasseh's wickedness; here we have his repentance, and amemorable instance it is of the riches of God's pardoning mercy, andthe power of his renewing grace. Deprived of his liberty, separatedfrom his evil counsellors and companions, without any prospect but ofending his days in a wretched prison, Manasseh thought upon what hadpassed; he began to cry for mercy and deliverance. He confessed hissins, condemned himself, was humbled before God, loathing himself as amonster of impiety and wickedness. Yet he hoped to be pardoned throughthe abundant mercy of the Lord. Then Manasseh knew that Jehovah wasGod, able to deliver. He knew him as a God of salvation; he learned tofear, trust in, love, and obey him. From this time he bore a newcharacter, and walked in newness of life. Who can tell what tortures ofconscience, what pangs of grief, what fears of wrath, what agonizingremorse he endured, when he looked back on his many years of apostacyand rebellion against God; on his having led thousands into sin andperdition; and on his blood-guiltiness in the persecution of a numberof God's children? And who can complain that the way of heaven isblocked up, when he sees such a sinner enter? Say the worst againstthyself, here is one as bad who finds the way to repentance. Deny notto thyself that which God hath not denied to thee; it is not thy sin,but thy impenitence, that bars heaven against thee. (2Ch 33:21-25)
2Ch 33:21-25	<br>Amon's father did ill, but he did worse. Whatever warnings orconvictions he had, he never humbled himself. He was soon cut off inhis sins, and made a warning for all men not to abuse the example ofGod's patience and mercy to Manasseh, as an encouragement to continuein sin. May God help us to be honest to ourselves, and to think arightrespecting our own character, before death fixes us in an unchangeablestate.
2Ch 35:1-19	<br>The destruction Josiah made of idolatry, was more largely related inthe book of Kings. His solemnizing the passover is related here. TheLord's supper resembles the passover more than any other of the Jewishfestivals; and the due observance of that ordinance, is a proof ofgrowing piety and devotion. God alone can truly make our hearts holy,and prepare them for his holy services; but there are duties belongingto us, in doing which we obtain this blessing from the Lord.
2Ch 35:20-27	<br>The Scripture does not condemn Josiah's conduct in opposing Pharaoh.Yet Josiah seems to deserve blame for not inquiring of the Lord afterhe was warned; his death might be a rebuke for his rashness, but it wasa judgment on a hypocritical and wicked people. He that lives a life ofrepentance, faith, and obedience, cannot be affected by the suddenmanner in which he is removed. The people lamented him. Many mourn oversufferings, who will not forsake the sins that caused God to send them.Yet this alone can turn away judgments. If we blame Josiah's conduct,we should be watchful, lest we be cut down in a way dishonourable toour profession.
2Ch 36:1-21	<br>The ruin of Judah and Jerusalem came on by degrees. The methods Godtakes to call back sinners by his word, by ministers, by conscience, byprovidences, are all instances of his compassion toward them, and hisunwillingness that any should perish. See here what woful havoc sinmakes, and, as we value the comfort and continuance of our earthlyblessings, let us keep that worm from the root of them. They had manytimes ploughed and sowed their land in the seventh year, when it shouldhave rested, and now it lay unploughed and unsown for ten times sevenyears. God will be no loser in his glory at last, by the disobedienceof men. If they refused to let the land rest, God would make it rest.What place, O God, shall thy justice spare, if Jerusalem has perished?If that delight of thine were cut off for wickedness, let us not behigh-minded, but fear.
2Ch 36:22,23	<br>God had promised the restoring of the captives, and the rebuilding ofJerusalem, at the end of seventy years; and that time to favour Zion,that set time, came at last. Though God's church be cast down, it isnot cast off; though his people be corrected, they are not abandoned;though thrown into the furnace, they are not lost there, nor left thereany longer than till the dross be separated. Though God contend long,he will not contend always. Before we close the books of theChronicles, which contain a faithful register of events, think whatdesolation sin introduced into the world, nay, even into the church ofGod. Let us tremble at what is here recorded, while in the character ofsome few gracious souls, we discover that the Lord left not himselfwithout witness. And when we have looked at this faithful portrait ofman by nature, let us contrast with it that same nature, when recoveredby Almighty grace, through the justifying and soul-adorningrighteousness of Christ our Saviour.
Ezr 1:1-4	<br>The Lord stirred up the spirit of Cyrus. The hearts of kings are in thehand of the Lord. God governs the world by his influence on the spiritsof men; whatever good they do, God stirs up their spirits to do it. Itwas during the captivity of the Jews, that God principally employedthem as the means of calling the attention of the heathen to him. Cyrustook it for granted, that those among the Jews who were able, wouldoffer free-will offerings for the house of God. He would also have themsupplied out of his kingdom. Well-wishers to the temple should bewell-doers for it.
Ezr 1:5-11	<br>The same God that raised up the spirit of Cyrus to proclaim liberty tothe Jews, raised up their spirits to take the benefit. The temptationwas to some to stay in Babylon; but some feared not to return, and theywere those whose spirits God raised, by his Spirit and grace. Whatevergood we do, is owing to the grace of God. Our spirits naturally bowdown to this earth and the things of it; if they move upward in anygood affections or good actions, it is God who raises them. The callsand offers of the gospel are like the proclamation of Cyrus. Thosebound under the power of sin, may be made free by Jesus Christ.Whosoever will, by repentance and faith, return to God, Jesus Christhas opened the way for him, and raises him out of the slavery of sininto the glorious liberty of the children of God. Many that hear thisjoyful sound, choose to sit still in Babylon, are in love with theirsins, and will not venture upon a holy life; but some break through alldiscouragements, whatever it cost them; they are those whose spirit Godhas raised above the world and the flesh, whom he has made willing.Thus will the heavenly Canaan be filled, though many perish in Babylon;and the gospel offer will not have been made in vain. The bringing backthe Jews from captivity, represents the redemption of sinners by JesusChrist.
Ezr 2:1-35	<br>An account was kept of the families that came up out of captivity. Seehow sin lowers a nation, which righteousness would exalt!
Ezr 2:36-63	<br>Those who undervalue their relation to the Lord in times of reproach,persecution, or distress, will have no benefit from it when it becomeshonourable or profitable. Those who have no evidence that they are, bythe new birth, spiritual priests unto God, through Jesus Christ, haveno right to the comforts and privileges of Christians.
Ezr 2:64-70	<br>Let none complain of the needful expenses of their religion. Seek firstthe kingdom of God, his favour and his glory, then will all otherthings be added unto them. Their offerings were nothing, compared withthe offerings of the princes in David's time; yet, being according totheir ability, were as acceptable to God. The Lord will carry usthrough all undertakings entered on according to his will, with an aimto his glory, and dependence on his assistance. Those who, at the callof the gospel, renounce sin and return to the Lord, shall be guardedand guided through all perils of the way, and arrive safely at themansions provided in the holy city of God.
Ezr 3:1-7	<br>From the proceedings of the Jews on their arrival, let us learn tobegin with God, and to do what we can in the worship of God, when wecannot do what we would. They could not at once have a temple, but theywould not be without an altar. Fear of danger should stir us to ourduty. Have we many enemies? Then it is good to have God our Friend, andto keep up communion with him. Our fears should drive us to our knees.The sacrifices for all these solemnities were a heavy expense for sopoor a company; yet besides those expressly appointed, many broughtfree-will offerings to the Lord. And they made preparation for thebuilding of the temple without delay: whatever God calls us to do, wemay depend upon his providence to furnish us with the needful means.
Ezr 3:8-13	<br>There was a remarkable mixture of affections upon laying the foundationof the temple. Those that only knew the misery of having no temple atall, praised the Lord with shouts of joy. To them, even this foundationseemed great. We ought to be thankful for the beginnings of mercy,though it be not yet perfect. But those who remembered the glory of thefirst temple, and considered how far inferior this was likely to be,wept with a loud voice. There was reason for it, and if they bewailedthe sin that was the cause of this melancholy change, they did well.Yet it was wrong to cast a damp upon the common joys. They despised theday of small things, and were unthankful for the good they enjoyed. Letnot the remembrance of former afflictions drown the sense of presentmercies.
Ezr 4:1-5	<br>Every attempt to revive true religion will stir up the opposition ofSatan, and of those in whom he works. The adversaries were theSamaritans, who had been planted in the land of Israel, 2Ki 17. It wasplain that they did not mean to unite in the worship of the Lord,according to his word. Let those who discourage a good work, and weakenthem that are employed in it, see whose pattern they follow. (Ezr4:6-24)
Ezr 4:6-24	<br>It is an old slander, that the prosperity of the church would behurtful to kings and princes. Nothing can be more false, for truegodliness teaches us to honour and obey our sovereign. But where thecommand of God requires one thing and the law of the land another, wemust obey God rather than man, and patiently submit to theconsequences. All who love the gospel should avoid all appearance ofevil, lest they should encourage the adversaries of the church. Theworld is ever ready to believe any accusation against the people ofGod, and refuses to listen to them. The king suffered himself to beimposed upon by these frauds and falsehoods. Princes see and hear withother men's eyes and ears, and judge things as represented to them,which are often done falsely. But God's judgment is just; he seesthings as they are.
Ezr 5:1,2	<br>The building of the temple was stopped about fifteen years. Then theyhad two good ministers, who urged them to go on with the work. It is asign that God has mercy in store for a people, when he raises upprophets to be helpers in the way and work of God, as guides,overseers, and rulers. In Haggai, we see what great things God does byhis word, which he magnifies above all his name, and by his Spiritworking with it.
Ezr 5:3-17	<br>While employed in God's work, we are under his special protection; hiseye is upon us for good. This should keep us to our duty, and encourageus therein, when difficulties are ever so discouraging. The elders ofthe Jews gave the Samaritans an account of their proceedings. Let uslearn hence, with meekness and fear, to give a reason of the hope thatis in us; let us rightly understand, and then readily declare, what wedo in God's service, and why we do it. And while in this world, wealways shall have to confess, that our sins have provoked the wrath ofGod. All our sufferings spring from thence, and all our comforts fromhis unmerited mercy. However the work may seem to be hindered, yet theLord Jesus Christ is carrying it on, his people are growing unto a holytemple in the Lord, for a habitation of God through the Spirit.
Ezr 6:1-12	<br>When God's time is come for fulfilling his gracious purposes concerninghis church, he will raise up instruments to do it, from whom such goodservice was not expected. While our thoughts are directed to thisevent, we are led by Zechariah to fix our regard on a nobler, aspiritual building. The Lord Jesus Christ continues to lay one stoneupon another: let us assist the great design. Difficulties delay theprogress of this sacred edifice. Yet let not opposition discourage us,for in due season it will be completed to his abundant praise. He shallbring forth the head-stone thereof with shoutings, crying, Grace, graceunto it.
Ezr 6:13-22	<br>The gospel church, that spiritual temple, is long in the building, butit will be finished at last, when the mystical body is completed. Everybeliever is a living temple, building up himself in his most holyfaith: much opposition is given to this work by Satan and our owncorruptions. We trifle, and proceed in it with many stops and pauses;but He that has begun the good work, will see it performed. Thenspirits of just men will be made perfect. By getting their sins takenaway, the Jews would free themselves from the sting of their latetroubles. Their service was with joy. Let us welcome holy ordinanceswith joy, and serve the Lord with gladness.
Ezr 7:1-10	<br>Ezra went from Babylon to Jerusalem, for the good of his country. Theking was kind to him; he granted all his requests, whatever Ezradesired to enable him to serve his country. When he went, many wentwith him; he obtained favour from his king, by the Divine favour. Everycreature is that to us, which God makes it to be. We must see the handof God in the events that befal us, and acknowledge him withthankfulness.
Ezr 7:11-26	<br>The liberality of heathen kings to support the worship of God,reproached the conduct of many kings of Judah, and will rise up injudgment against the covetousness of wealthy professed Christians, whowill not promote the cause of God. But the weapons of Christianministers are not carnal. Faithful preaching, holy lives, ferventprayers, and patient suffering when called to it, are the means tobring men into obedience to Christ.
Ezr 7:27,28	<br>Two things Ezra blessed God for: 1. For his commission. If any goodappear in our hearts, or in the hearts of others, we must own that Godput it there, and bless him; it is he that worketh in us, both to willand to do that which is good. 2. For his encouragement: God hasextended mercy to me. Ezra was a man of courage, yet he ascribed thisnot to his own heart, but to God's hand. If God give us his hand, weare bold and cheerful; if he withdraw it, we are weak as water.Whatever we are enabled to do for God and those around us, God musthave all the glory.
Ezr 8:1-20	<br>Ezra assembles the outcasts of Israel, and the dispersed of Judah. Godraised up the spirits of a small remnant to accompany him. What a pitythat good men should omit a good work, for want of being spoken to!
Ezr 8:21-23	<br>Ezra procured Levites to go with him; but what will that avail, unlesshe have God with him? Those who seek God, are safe under the shadow ofhis wings, even in their greatest dangers; but those who forsake him,are always exposed. When entering upon any new state of life, our careshould be, to bring none of the guilt of the sins of our formercondition into it. When we are in any peril, let us be at peace withGod, and then nothing can do us any real hurt. All our concerns aboutourselves, our families, and our estates, it is our wisdom and duty, byprayer to commit to God, and to leave the care of them with him. And,on some occasions, we should decline advantages which are within ourreach, lest we should cause others to stumble, and so our God bedishonoured. Let us ask wisdom of God, that we may know how to use orto refuse lawful things. We shall be no losers by venturing, suffering,or giving up for the Lord's sake. Their prayers were answered, and theevent declared it. Never have any that sought God in earnest, foundthat they sought him in vain. In times of difficulty and danger, to seta season apart for secret or for social prayer, is the best method forrelief we can take.
Ezr 8:24-30	<br>Do we expect that God should, by his providence, keep that whichbelongs to us, let us, by his grace, keep that which belongs to him.Let God's honour and interest be our care; and then we may expect thatour lives and comforts will be his.
Ezr 8:31-36	<br>Enemies laid wait for the Jews, but God protected them. Even the commonperils of journeys, call us to go out with prayer, and to return withpraise and thanksgiving. But what shall we render when the Lord has ledus safely through the pilgrimage of life, through the gloomy vale ofdeath, out of the reach of all our enemies, into everlasting happiness!Among their sacrifices they had a sin-offering. The atonement sweetensand secures every mercy to us, which will not be truly comfortable,unless sin be taken away, and our peace made with God. Then had thechurch rest. The expressions here used, direct us to the deliverance ofsinners from spiritual bondage, and their pilgrimage to the heavenlyJerusalem, under the care and protection of their God and Saviour.
Ezr 9:1-4	<br>Many corruptions lurk out of the view of the most careful rulers. Someof the people disobeyed the express command of God, which forbade allmarriages with the heathen, De 7. Disbelief of God's all-sufficiency,is at the bottom of the sorry shifts we make to help ourselves. Theyexposed themselves and their children to the peril of idolatry, thathad ruined their church and nation. Carnal professors may make light ofsuch connexions, and try to explain away the exhortations to beseparate; but those who are best acquainted with the word of God, willtreat the subject in another manner. They must forebode the worst fromsuch unions. The evils excused, and even pleaded for; by manyprofessors, astonish and cause regret in the true believer. All whoprofess to be God's people, ought to strengthen those that appear andact against vice and profaneness.
Ezr 9:5-15	<br>The sacrifice, especially the evening sacrifice, was a type of theblessed Lamb of God, who in the evening of the world, was to take awaysin by the sacrifice of himself. Ezra's address is a penitentconfession of sin, the sin of his people. But let this be the comfortof true penitents, that though their sins reach to the heavens, God'smercy is in the heavens. Ezra, speaking of sin, speaks as one muchashamed. Holy shame is as necessary in true repentance as holy sorrow.Ezra speaks as much amazed. The discoveries of guilt cause amazement;the more we think of sin, the worse it looks. Say, God be merciful tome sinner. Ezra speaks as one much afraid. There is not a surer orsaddler presage of ruin, than turning to sin, after great judgments,and great deliverances. Every one in the church of God, has to wonderthat he has not wearied out the Lord's patience, and broughtdestruction upon himself. What then must be the case of the ungodly?But though the true penitent has nothing to plead in his own behalf,the heavenly Advocate pleads most powerfully for him.
Ezr 10:1-5	<br>Shechaniah owned the national guilt. The case is sad, but it is notdesperate; the disease threatening, but not incurable. Now that thepeople begin to lament, a spirit of repentance seems to be poured out;now there is hope that God will forgive, and have mercy. The sin thatrightly troubles us, shall not ruin us. In melancholy times we mustobserve what makes for us, as well as against us. And there may be goodhopes through grace, even where there is the sense of great guiltbefore God. The case is plain; what has been done amiss, must be undoneagain as far as possible; nothing less than this is true repentance.Sin must be put away, with a resolution never to have any thing more todo with it. What has been unjustly got, must be restored. Arise, be ofgood courage. Weeping, in this case, is good, but reforming is better.As to being unequally yoked with unbelievers, such marriages, it iscertain, are sinful, and ought not to be made; but now they are notnull, as they were before the gospel did away the separation betweenJews and Gentiles.
Ezr 10:6-14	<br>There is hope concerning people, when they are convinced, not only thatit is good to part with their sins, but that it is necessary; we mustdo it, or we are undone. So rich is the mercy, and so plenteous theredemption of God, that there is hope for the vilest who hear thegospel, and are willing to accept of free salvation. When sinners mournfor their sins, and tremble at the word of God, there is hope that theywill forsake them. To affect others with godly sorrow or love to God,we must ourselves be affected. It was carefully agreed how this affairshould be carried on. That which is hastily resolved on seldom proveslasting.
Ezr 10:15-44	<br>The best reformers can but do their endeavour; when the Redeemerhimself shall come to Zion, he shall effectually turn away ungodlinessfrom Jacob. And when sin is repented of and forsaken, God will forgiveit; but the blood of Christ, our Sin-offering, is the only atonementwhich takes away our guilt. No seeming repentance or amendment willbenefit those who reject Him, for self-dependence proves them stillunhumbled. All the names written in the book of life, are those ofpenitent sinners, not of self-righteous persons, who think they have noneed of repentance.
Neh 2:1-8	<br>Our prayers must be seconded with serious endeavours, else we mock God.We are not limited to certain moments in our addresses to the King ofkings, but have liberty to go to him at all times; approaches to thethrone of grace are never out of season. But the sense of God'sdispleasure and the afflictions of his people, are causes of sorrow tothe children of God, under which no earthly delights can comfort. Theking encouraged Nehemiah to tell his mind. This gave him boldness tospeak; much more may the invitation Christ has given us to pray, andthe promise that we shall speed, encourage us to come boldly to thethrone of grace. Nehemiah prayed to the God of heaven, as infinitelyabove even this mighty monarch. He lifted up his heart to that God whounderstands the language of the heart. Nor should we ever engage in anypursuit in which it would be wrong for us thus to seek and expect theDivine direction, assistance, and blessing. There was an immediateanswer to his prayer; for the seed of Jacob never sought the God ofJacob in vain.
Neh 2:9-18	<br>When Nehemiah had considered the matter, he told the Jews that God hadput it into his heart to build the wall of Jerusalem. He does notundertake to do it without them. By stirring up ourselves and oneanother to that which is good, we strengthen ourselves and one anotherfor it. We are weak in our duty, when we are cold and careless.
Neh 2:19,20	<br>The enmity of the serpent's seed against the cause of Christ isconfined to no age or nation. The application to ourselves is plain.The church of God asks for our help. Is it not desolate, and exposed toassaults? Does the consideration of its low estate cause you any grief?Let not business, pleasure, or the support of a party so engageattention, as that Zion and her welfare shall be nothing to you.
Neh 4:1-6	<br>Many a good work has been looked upon with contempt by proud andhaughty scorners. Those who disagree in almost every thing, will unitein persecution. Nehemiah did not answer these fools according to theirfolly, but looked up to God by prayer. God's people have often been adespised people, but he hears all the slights that are put upon them,and it is their comfort that he does so. Nehemiah had reason to thinkthat the hearts of those sinners were desperately hardened, else hewould not have prayed that their sins might never be blotted out. Goodwork goes on well, when people have a mind to it. The reproaches ofenemies should quicken us to our duty, not drive us from it.
Neh 4:7-15	<br>The hindering good work is what bad men aim at, and promise themselvessuccess in; but good work is God's work, and it shall prosper. God hasmany ways of bringing to light, and so of bringing to nought, thedevices and designs of his church's enemies. If our enemies cannotfrighten us from duty, or deceive us into sin, they cannot hurt us.Nehemiah put himself and his cause under the Divine protection. It wasthe way of this good man, and should be our way. All his cares, all hisgriefs, all his fears, he spread before God. Before he used any means,he made his prayer to God. Having prayed, he set a watch against theenemy. If we think to secure ourselves by prayer, without watchfulness,we are slothful, and tempt God; if by watchfulness, without prayer, weare proud, and slight God: either way, we forfeit his protection. God'scare of our safety, should engage and encourage us to go on with vigourin our duty. As soon as a danger is over, let us return to our work,and trust God another time.
Neh 4:16-23	<br>We must watch always against spiritual enemies, and not expect that ourwarfare will be over till our work is ended. The word of God is thesword of the Spirit, which we ought to have always at hand, and neverto have to seek for it, either in our labours, or in our conflicts, asChristians. Every true Christian is both a labourer and a soldier,working with one hand, and fighting with the other. Good work is likelyto go on with success, when those who labour in it, make a business ofit. And Satan fears to assault the watchful Christian; or, if attacked,the Lord fights for him. Thus must we wait to the close of life, neverputting off our armour till our work and warfare are ended; then weshall be welcomed to the rest and joy of our Lord.
Neh 5:1-5	<br>Men prey upon their fellow-creatures: by despising the poor theyreproach their Maker. Such conduct is a disgrace to any, but who cansufficiently abhor it when adopted by professing Christians? Withcompassion for the oppressed, we should lament the hardships which manyin the world are groaning under; putting our souls into their souls'stead, and remembering in our prayers and succours those who areburdened. But let those who show no mercy, expect judgment withoutmercy.
Neh 5:6-13	<br>Nehemiah knew that, if he built Jerusalem's walls ever so high, sothick, or so strong, the city could not be safe while there wereabuses. The right way to reform men's lives, is to convince theirconsciences. If you walk in the fear of God, you will not be eithercovetous of worldly gain, or cruel toward your brethren. Nothingexposes religion more to reproach, than the worldliness andhard-heartedness of the professors of it. Those that rigorously insistupon their right, with a very ill grace try to persuade others to giveup theirs. In reasoning with selfish people, it is good to contrasttheir conduct with that of others who are liberal; but it is best topoint to His example, who though he was rich, yet for our sakes becamepoor, that we, through his poverty, might be rich, 2Co 8:9. They didaccording to promise. Good promises are good things, but goodperformances are better.
Neh 5:14-19	<br>Those who truly fear God, will not dare to do any thing cruel orunjust. Let all who are in public places remember that they are soplaced to do good, not to enrich themselves. Nehemiah mentions it toGod in prayer, not as if he had merited any favour from God, but toshow that he depended upon God only, to make up to him what he had lostand laid out for his honour. Nehemiah evidently spake and acted as onethat knew himself to be a sinner. He did not mean to claim a reward asof debt, but in the manner that the Lord rewards a cup of cold watergiven to a disciple for his sake. The fear and love of God in theheart, and true love of the brethren, will lead to every good work.These are proper evidences of justifying faith; and our reconciled Godwill look upon persons of this character for good, according to allthey have done for his people.
Neh 6:1-9	<br>Let those who are tempted to idle merry meetings by vain companions,thus answer the temptation, We have work to do, and must not neglectit. We must never suffer ourselves to be overcome, by repeated urgency,to do anything sinful or imprudent; but when attacked with the sametemptation, must resist it with the same reason and resolution. It iscommon for that which is desired only by the malicious, to be falselyrepresented by them as desired by the many. But Nehemiah knew at whatthey aimed, he not only denied that such things were true, but thatthey were reported; he was better known than to be thus suspected. Wemust never omit any known duty for fear it should be misconstrued; but,while we keep a good conscience, let us trust God with our good name.God's people, though loaded with reproach, are not really fallen so lowin reputation as some would have them thought to be. Nehemiah lifted uphis heart to Heaven in a short prayer. When, in our Christian work andwarfare, we enter upon any service or conflict, this is a good prayer,I have such a duty to do, such a temptation to grapple with; now,therefore, O God, strengthen my hands. Every temptation to draw us fromduty, should quicken us the more to duty.
Neh 6:10-14	<br>The greatest mischief our enemies can do us, is, to frighten us fromour duty, and to lead us to do what is sinful. Let us never decline agood work, never do a bad one. We ought to try all advice, and toreject what is contrary to the word of God. Every man should study tobe consistent. Should I, a professed Christian, called to be a saint, achild of God, a member of Christ, a temple of the Holy Ghost, should Ibe covetous, sensual, proud, or envious? Should I yield to impatience,discontent, or anger? Should I be slothful, unbelieving, or unmerciful?What effects will such conduct have upon others? All that God has donefor us, or by us, or given to us, should lead us to watchfulness,self-denial, and diligence. Next to the sinfulness of sin, we shoulddread the scandal.
Neh 6:15-19	<br>The wall was begun and finished in fifty-two days, though they restedon the sabbaths. A great deal of work may be done in a little time, ifwe set about it in earnest, and keep close to it. See the mischief ofmarrying with strangers. When men once became akin to Tobiah, they soonbecame sworn to him. A sinful love leads to a sinful league. The enemyof souls employs many instruments, and forms many projects, to bringreproach on the active servants of God, or to take them from theirwork. But we should follow the example of Him who laid down his lifefor the sheep. Those that simply cleave to the Lord and his work willbe supported.
Neh 7:1-4	<br>Nehemiah, having finished the wall, returned to the Persian court, andcame to Jerusalem again with a new commission. The public safetydepends on every one's care to guard himself and his family againstsin.
Neh 7:5-73	<br>Nehemiah knew that the safety of a city, under God, depends more uponthe inhabitants than upon its walls. Every good gift and every goodwork are from above. God gives knowledge, he gives grace; all is ofhim, and therefore all must be to him. What is done by human prudence,must be ascribed to the direction of Divine Providence. But woe tothose who turn back from the Lord, loving this present world! and happythose who dedicate themselves, and their substance, to his service andglory!
Neh 8:1-8	<br>Sacrifices were to be offered only at the door of the temple; butpraying and preaching were, and are, services of religion, asacceptably performed in one place as in another. Masters of familiesshould bring their families with them to the public worship of God.Women and children have souls to save, and are therefore to acquaintthemselves with the word of God, and to attend on the means of grace.Little ones, as they come to reason, must be trained up in religion.Ministers when they go to the pulpit, should take their Bibles withthem; Ezra did so. Thence they must fetch their knowledge; according tothat rule they must speak, and must show that they do so. Reading theScriptures in religious assemblies is an ordinance of God, whereby heis honoured, and his church edified. Those who hear the word, shouldunderstand it, else it is to them but an empty sound of words. It istherefore required of teachers that they explain the word, and give thesense of it. Reading is good, and preaching is good, but expoundingmakes reading the better understood, and preaching the more convincing.It has pleased God in almost every age of the church to raise up, notonly those who have preached the gospel, but also those who have giventheir views of Divine truth in writing; and though many who haveattempted to explain Scripture, have darkened counsel by words withoutknowledge, yet the labours of others are of excellent use. All that wehear must, however, be brought to the test of Scripture. They heardreadily, and minded every word. The word of God demands attention. Ifthrough carelessness we let much slip in hearing, there is danger thatthrough forgetfulness we shall let all slip after hearing.
Neh 8:9-12	<br>It was a good sign that their hearts were tender, when they heard thewords of the law. The people were to send portions to those for whomnothing was prepared. It is the duty of a religious feast, as well asof a religious fast, to draw out the soul to the hungry; God's bountyshould make us bountiful. We must not only give to those that offerthemselves, but send to those out of sight. Their strength consisted injoy in the Lord. The better we understand God's word, the more comfortwe find in it; the darkness of trouble arises from the darkness ofignorance.
Neh 8:13-18	<br>They found written in the law about the feast of tabernacles. Those whodiligently search the Scriptures, find things written there which theyhave forgotten. This feast of tabernacles was a representation of thebeliever's tabernacle state in this world, and a type of the holy joyof the gospel church. The conversion of the nations to the faith ofChrist, is foretold under the figure of this feast, Zec 14:16. Truereligion will render us strangers and pilgrims upon earth. We read andhear the word acceptably and profitably, when we do according to whatis written therein; when what appears to be our duty is revived, afterit has been neglected. They minded the substance; else the ceremony hadbeen of no use. They did it, rejoicing in God and his goodness. Theseare the means which the Spirit of God crowns with success, in bringingthe hearts of sinners to tremble and to become humbled before God. Butthose are enemies to their own growth in holiness, who always indulgesorrow, even for sin, and put away from them the consolations tenderedby the word and Spirit of God.
Neh 9:1-3	<br>The word will direct and quicken prayer, for by it the Spirit helps ourinfirmities in prayer. The careful study of God's word will more andmore discover to us our own sinfulness, and the plenteousness of hissalvation; thus it calls us to mourn for sin, and to rejoice in him.Every discovery of the truth of God, should render us more unwearied inattendance on his sacred word, and on his worship.
Neh 9:4-38	<br>The summary of their prayers we have here upon record. Much more, nodoubt, was said. Whatever ability we have to do any thing in the way ofduty, we are to serve and glorify God according to the utmost of it.When confessing our sins, it is good to notice the mercies of God, thatwe may be the more humbled and ashamed. The dealings of the Lord showedhis goodness and long-suffering, and the hardness of their hearts. Thetestimony of the prophets was the testimony of the Spirit in theprophets, and it was the Spirit of Christ in them. They spake as theywere moved by the Holy Ghost, and what they said is to be receivedaccordingly. The result was, wonder at the Lord's mercies, and thefeeling that sin had brought them to their present state, from whichnothing but unmerited love could rescue them. And is not their conducta specimen of human nature? Let us study the history of our land, andour own history. Let us recollect our advantages from childhood, andask what were our first returns? Let us frequently do so, that we maybe kept humble, thankful, and watchful. Let all remember that pride andobstinacy are sins which ruin the soul. But it is often as hard topersuade the broken-hearted to hope, as formerly it was to bring themto fear. Is this thy case? Behold this sweet promise, A God ready topardon! Instead of keeping away from God under a sense of unworthiness,let us come boldly to the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy,and find grace to help in time of need. He is a God ready to pardon.
Neh 10:1-31	<br>Conversion is separating from the course and custom of this world,devoting ourselves to the conduct directed by the word of God. When webind ourselves to do the commandments of God, it is to do all hiscommandments, and to look to him as the Lord, and our Lord.
Neh 10:32-39	<br>Having covenanted against the sins of which they had been guilty, theyobliged themselves to observe the duties they had neglected. We mustnot only cease to do evil, but learn to do well. Let not any peopleexpect the blessing of God, unless they keep up public worship. It islikely to go well with our houses, when care is taken that the work ofGod's house goes on well. When every one helps, and every one gives,though but little, toward a good work, the whole will come to be alarge sum. We must do what we can in works of piety and charity; andwhatever state we are placed in, cheerfully perform our duty to God,which will be the surest way to ease and liberty. As the ordinances ofGod are the appointed means of support to our souls, the believer willnot grudge the expense; yet most people leave their souls to starve.
Neh 12:1-26	<br>It is a debt we owe to faithful ministers, to remember our guides, whohave spoken to us the word of God. It is good to know what our godlypredecessors were, that we may learn what we should be.
Neh 12:27-43	<br>All our cities, all our houses, must have holiness to the Lord writtenupon them. The believer should undertake nothing which he does notdedicate to the Lord. We are concerned to cleanse our hands, and purifyour hearts, when any work for God is to pass through them. Those thatwould be employed to sanctify others, must sanctify themselves, and setthemselves apart for God. To those who are sanctified, all theircreature-comforts and enjoyments are made holy. The people greatlyrejoiced. All that share in public mercies, ought to join in publicthanksgivings.
Neh 12:44-47	<br>When the solemnities of a thanksgiving day leave such impressions onministers and people, that both are more careful and cheerful in doingtheir duty, they are indeed acceptable to the Lord, and turn to goodaccount. And whatever we do, must be purified by the blood ofsprinkling, and by the grace of the Holy Spirit, or it cannot beacceptable to God.
Neh 13:1-9	<br>Israel was a peculiar people, and not to mingle with the nations. Seethe benefit of publicly reading the word of God; when it is dulyattended to, it discovers to us sin and duty, good and evil, and showswherein we have erred. We profit, when we are thus wrought upon toseparate from evil. Those that would drive sin out of their hearts, theliving temples, must throw out its household stuff, and all theprovision made for it; and take away all the things that are the foodand fuel of lust; this is really to mortify it. When sin is cast out ofthe heart by repentance, let the blood of Christ be applied to it byfaith, then let it be furnished with the graces of God's Spirit, forevery good work.
Neh 13:10-14	<br>If a sacred character will not keep men from setting an evil example,it must not shelter any one from deserved blame and punishment. TheLevites had been wronged; their portions had not been given them. Theywere gone to get livelihoods for themselves and their families, fortheir profession would not maintain them. A maintenance not sufficient,makes a poor ministry. The work is neglected, because the workmen are.Nehemiah laid the fault upon the rulers. Both ministers and people, whoforsake religion and the services of it, and magistrates, who do notwhat they can to keep them to it, will have much to answer for. Hedelayed not to bring the Levites to their places again, and that justpayment should be made. Nehemiah on every occasion looked up to God,and committed himself and all his affairs to Him. It pleased him tothink that he had been of use to revive and support religion in hiscountry. He here refers to God, not in pride, but with a humble appealconcerning his honest intention in what he had done. He prays,"Remember me;" not, Reward me. "Wipe not out my good deeds;" not,Publish them, or record them. Yet he was rewarded, and his good deedsrecorded. God does more than we are able to ask.
Neh 13:15-22	<br>The keeping holy the Lord's day forms an important object for theirattention who would promote true godliness. Religion never prosperswhile sabbaths are trodden under foot. No wonder there was a generaldecay of religion, and corruption of manners among the Jews, when theyforsook the sanctuary and profaned the sabbath. Those little considerwhat an evil they do, who profane the sabbath. We must answer for thesins others are led to commit by our example. Nehemiah charges it onthem as an evil thing, for so it is, proceeding from contempt of Godand our own souls. He shows that sabbath-breaking was one of the sinsfor which God had brought judgments upon them; and if they did not takewarning, but returned to the same sins again, they had to expectfurther judgments. The courage, zeal, and prudence of Nehemiah in thismatter, are recorded for us to do likewise; and we have reason tothink, that the cure he wrought was lasting. He felt and confessedhimself a sinner, who could demand nothing from God as justice, when hethus cried unto him for mercy.
Neh 13:23-31	<br>If either parent be ungodly, corrupt nature will incline the childrento take after that one; which is a strong reason why Christians shouldnot be unequally yoked. In the education of children, great care shouldbe taken about the government of their tongues; that they learn not thelanguage of Ashdod, no impious or impure talk, no corruptcommunication. Nehemiah showed the evil of these marriages. Some, moreobstinate than the rest, he smote, that is, ordered them to be beatenby the officers according to the law, De 25:2,3. Here are Nehemiah'sprayers on this occasion He prays, "Remember them, O my God." Lord,convince and convert them; put them in mind of what they should be anddo. The best services to the public have been forgotten by those forwhom they were done, therefore Nehemiah refers himself to God, torecompense him. This may well be the summary of our petitions; we needno more to make us happy than this; Remember me, O my God, for good. Wemay humbly hope that the Lord will remember us and our services,although, after lives of unwearied activity and usefulness, we shallstill see cause to abhor ourselves and repent in dust and ashes, and tocry out with Nehemiah, Spare me, O my God, according to the greatnessof they mercy.
Est 1:1-9	<br>The pride of Ahasuerus's heart rising with the grandeur of his kingdom,he made an extravagant feast. This was vain glory. Better is a dinnerof herbs with quietness, than this banquet of wine, with all the noiseand tumult that must have attended it. But except grace prevails in theheart, self-exaltation and self-indulgence, in one form or another,will be the ruling principle. Yet none did compel; so that if any drankto excess, it was their own fault. This caution of a heathen prince,even when he would show his generosity, may shame many calledChristians, who, under pretence of sending the health round, send sinround, and death with it. There is a woe to them that do so; let themread it, and tremble, Hab 2:15,16.
Est 1:10-22	<br>Ahasuerus's feast ended in heaviness, by his own folly. Seasons ofpeculiar festivity often end in vexation. Superiors should be carefulnot to command what may reasonably be disobeyed. But when wine is in,men's reason departs from them. He that had rule over 127 provinces,had no rule over his own spirit. But whether the passion or the policyof the king was served by this decree, God's providence made way forEsther to the crown, and defeated Haman's wicked project, even beforeit had entered into his heart, and he arrived at his power. Let usrejoice that the Lord reigns, and will overrule the madness or folly ofmankind to promote his own glory, and the safety and happiness of hispeople.
Est 2:1-20	<br>We see to what absurd practices those came, who were destitute ofDivine revelation, and what need there was of the gospel of Christ, topurify men from the lusts of the flesh, and to bring them back to theoriginal institution of marriage. Esther was preferred as queen. Thosewho suggest that Esther committed sin to come at this dignity, do notconsider the custom of those times and countries. Every one that theking took was married to him, and was his wife, though of a lower rank.But how low is human nature sunk, when such as these are the leadingpursuits and highest worldly happiness of men! Disappointment andvexation must follow; and he most wisely consults his enjoyment, evenin this present life, who most exactly obeys the precepts of the Divinelaw. But let us turn to consider the wise and merciful providence ofGod, carrying on his deep but holy designs in the midst of all this.And let no change in our condition be a pretext for forgetting ourduties to parents, or the friends who have stood in their place.
Est 2:21-23	<br>Good subjects must not conceal any bad design they know of against theprince, or the public peace. Mordecai was not rewarded at the time, buta remembrance was written. Thus, with respect to those who serveChrist, though their recompence is not till the resurrection of thejust, yet an account is kept of their work of faith and labour of love,which God is not unrighteous to forget. The servant of God must befaithful to every trust, and watchful for those who employ him. If heappear to be neglected now, he will be remembered hereafter. None ofour actions can be forgotten; even our most secret thoughts are writtenin lasting registers, Re 20:12.
Est 3:1-6	<br>Mordecai refused to reverence Haman. The religion of a Jew forbade himto give honours to any mortal man which savoured of idolatry,especially to so wicked a man as Haman. By nature all are idolaters;self is our favourite idol, we are pleased to be treated as if everything were at our disposal. Though religion by no means destroys goodmanners, but teaches us to render honour to whom honour is due, yet bya citizen of Zion, not only in his heart, but in his eyes, such a vileperson as Haman was, is contemned, Ps 15:4. The true believer cannotobey edicts, or conform to fashions, which break the law of God. Hemust obey God rather than man, and leave the consequences to him. Hamanwas full of wrath. His device was inspired by that wicked spirit, whohas been a murderer from the beginning; whose enmity to Christ and hischurch, governs all his children.
Est 3:7-15	<br>Without some acquaintance with the human heart, and the history ofmankind, we should not think that any prince could consent to adreadful proposal, so hurtful to himself. Let us be thankful for mildand just government. Haman inquires, according to his ownsuperstitions, how to find a lucky day for the designed massacre! God'swisdom serves its own purposes by men's folly. Haman has appealed tothe lot, and the lot, by delaying the execution, gives judgment againsthim. The event explains the doctrine of a particular providence overall the affairs of men, and the care of God over his church. Haman wasafraid lest the king's conscience should smite him for what he haddone; to prevent which, he kept him drinking. This cursed method manyoften take to drown convictions, and to harden their own hearts, andthe hearts of others, in sin. All appeared in a favourable train toaccomplish the project. But though sinners are permitted to proceed tothe point they aim at, an unseen but almighty Power turns them back.How vain and contemptible are the strongest assaults against Jehovah!Had Haman obtained his wish, and the Jewish nation perished, what musthave become of all the promises? How could the prophecies concerningthe great Redeemer of the world have been fulfilled? Thus theeverlasting covenant itself must have failed, before this diabolicalproject could take place.
Est 4:1-4	<br>Mordecai avowed his relation to the Jews. Public calamities, thatoppress the church of God, should affect our hearts more than anyprivate affliction, and it is peculiarly distressing to occasionsufferings to others. God will keep those that are exposed to evil bythe tenderness of their consciences.
Est 4:5-17	<br>We are prone to shrink from services that are attended with peril orloss. But when the cause of Christ and his people demand it, we musttake up our cross, and follow him. When Christians are disposed toconsult their own ease or safety, rather than the public good, theyshould be blamed. The law was express, all knew it. It is not thus inthe court of the King of kings: to the footstool of his throne of gracewe may always come boldly, and may be sure of an answer of peace to theprayer of faith. We are welcome, even into the holiest, through theblood of Jesus. Providence so ordered it, that, just then, the king'saffections had cooled toward Esther; her faith and courage thereby werethe more tried; and God's goodness in the favour she now found with theking, thereby shone the brighter. Haman no doubt did what he could toset the king against her. Mordecai suggests, that it was a cause which,one way or other, would certainly be carried, and which therefore shemight safely venture in. This was the language of strong faith, whichstaggered not at the promise when the danger was most threatening, butagainst hope believed in hope. He that by sinful devices will save hislife, and will not trust God with it in the way of duty, shall lose itin the way of sin. Divine Providence had regard to this matter, inbringing Esther to be queen. Therefore thou art bound in gratitude todo this service for God and his church, else thou dost not answer theend of thy being raised up. There is wise counsel and design in all theprovidences of God, which will prove that they are all intended for thegood of the church. We should, every one, consider for what end God hasput us in the place where we are, and study to answer that end: andtake care that we do not let it slip. Having solemnly commended oursouls and our cause to God, we may venture upon his service. Alldangers are trifling compared with the danger of losing our souls. Butthe trembling sinner is often as much afraid of casting himself,without reserve, upon the Lord's free mercy, as Esther was of comingbefore the king. Let him venture, as she did, with earnest prayer andsupplication, and he shall fare as well and better than she did. Thecause of God must prevail: we are safe in being united to it.
Est 5:1-8	<br>Esther having had power with God, and prevailing, like Jacob, had powerwith men too. He that will lose his life for God, shall save it, orfind it in a better life. The king encouraged her. Let us from this beencouraged to pray always to our God, and not to faint. Esther came toa proud, imperious man; but we come to the God of love and grace. Shewas not called, but we are; the Spirit says, Come, and the Bride says,Come. She had a law against her, we have a promise, many a promise, infavour of us; Ask, and it shall be given you. She had no friend to gowith her, or to plead for her; on the contrary, he that was then theking's favourite, was her enemy; but we have an Advocate with theFather, in whom he is well pleased. Let us therefore come boldly to thethrone of grace. God put it into Esther's heart to delay her petition aday longer; she knew not, but God did, what was to happen in that verynight.
Est 5:9-14	<br>This account of Haman is a comment upon Pr 21:24. Self-admirers andself-flatterers are really self-deceivers. Haman, the higher he islifted up, the more impatient he is of contempt, and the more enragedat it. The affront from Mordecai spoiled all. A slight affront, which ahumble man would scarcely notice, will torment a proud man, even tomadness, and will mar all his comforts. Those disposed to be uneasy,will never want something to be uneasy at. Such are proud men; thoughthey have much to their mind, if they have not all to their mind, it isas nothing to them. Many call the proud happy, who display pomp andmake a show; but this is a mistaken thought. Many poor cottagers feelfar less uneasiness than the rich, with all their fancied advantagesaround them. The man who knows not Christ, is poor though he be rich,because he is utterly destitute of that which alone is true riches.
Est 6:1-3	<br>The providence of God rules over the smallest concerns of men. Not asparrow falls to the ground without him. Trace the steps whichProvidence took towards the advancement of Mordecai. The king could notsleep when Providence had a design to serve, in keeping him awake. Weread of no illness that broke his sleep, but God, whose gift sleep is,withheld it from him. He who commanded a hundred and twenty-sevenprovinces, could not command one hour's sleep.
Est 6:4-11	<br>See how men's pride deceives them. The deceitfulness of our own heartsappears in nothing more than in the conceit we have of ourselves andour own performances: against which we should constantly watch andpray. Haman thought the king loved and valued no one but himself, buthe was deceived. We should suspect that the esteem which others professfor us, is not so great as it seems to be, that we may not think toowell of ourselves, nor trust too much in others. How Haman is struck,when the king bids him do honour to Mordecai the Jew, the very man whomhe hated above all men, whose ruin he was now designing!
Est 6:12-14	<br>Mordecai was not puffed up with his honours, he returned to his placeand the duty of it. Honour is well bestowed on those that do not thinkthemselves above their business. But Haman could not bear it. What harmhad it done him? But that will break a proud man's heart, which willnot break a humble man's sleep. His doom was, out of this event, readto him by his wife and his friends. They plainly confessed that theJews, though scattered through the nations, were special objects ofDivine care. Miserable comforters are they all; they did not adviseHaman to repent, but foretold his fate as unavoidable. The wisdom ofGod is seen, in timing the means of his church's deliverance, so as tomanifest his own glory.
Est 7:1-6	<br>If the love of life causes earnest pleadings with those that can onlykill the body, how fervent should our prayers be to Him, who is able todestroy both body and soul in hell! How should we pray for thesalvation of our relatives, friends, and all around us! When wepetition great men, we must be cautious not to give them offence; evenjust complaints must often be kept back. But when we approach the Kingof kings with reverence, we cannot ask or expect too much. Thoughnothing but wrath be our due, God is able and willing to do exceedingabundantly, even beyond all we can ask or think.
Est 7:7-10	<br>The king was angry: those that do things with self-will, reflect uponthem afterward with self-reproach. When angry, we should pause beforewe come to any resolution, and thus rule our own spirits, and show thatwe are governed by reason. Those that are most haughty and insolentwhen in power and prosperity, commonly, like Haman, are the most abjectand poor-spirited when brought down. The day is coming when those thathate and persecute God's chosen ones, would gladly be beholden to them.The king returns yet more angry against Haman. Those about him wereready to put his wrath into execution. How little can proud men be sureof the interest they think they have! The enemies of God's church haveoften been thus taken in their own craftiness. The Lord is known bysuch judgments. Then was the king's wrath pacified, and not till then.And who pities Haman hanged on his own gallows? who does not ratherrejoice in the Divine righteousness displayed in the destruction hisown art brought upon him? Let the workers of iniquity tremble, turn tothe Lord, and seek pardon through the blood of Jesus.
Est 8:1,2	<br>What Haman would have done mischief with, Esther will do good with. Allthe trust the king had reposed in Haman, he now placed in Mordecai: ahappy change. See the vanity of laying up treasure upon earth; he thatheapeth up riches, knoweth not who shall gather them. With what littlepleasure, nay, with what constant vexation, would Haman have lookedupon his estate, if he could have foreseen that Mordecai, the man hehated above all men in the world, should have rule over all thatwherein he had laboured! It is our interest to make sure of thoseriches which will not be left behind, but which will go with us toanother world.
Est 8:3-14	<br>It was time to be earnest, when the church of God was at stake. Esther,though safe herself, fell down and begged for the deliverance of herpeople. We read of no tears when she begged for her own life, butalthough she was sure of that, she wept for her people. Tears of pityand tenderness are the most Christ-like. According to the constitutionof the Persian government, no law or decree could be repealed orrecalled. This is so far from speaking to the wisdom and honour of theMedes and Persians, that it clearly shows their pride and folly. Thissavours of that old presumption which ruined all, We will be as gods!It is God's prerogative not to repent, or to say what can never bealtered or unsaid. Yet a way was found, by another decree, to authorizethe Jews to stand upon their defence. The decree was published in thelanguages of all the provinces. Shall all the subjects of an earthlyprince have his decrees in languages they understand, and shall God'soracles and laws be locked up from any of his servants in an unknowntongue?
Est 8:15-17	<br>Mordecai's robes now were rich. These things are not worth notice, butas marks of the king's favour, and the fruit of God's favour to hischurch. It is well with a land, when ensigns of dignity are made theornaments of serious piety. When the church prospers, many will joinit, who will be shy of it when in trouble. When believers have rest,and walk in the fear of the Lord, and the comfort of the Holy Ghost,they will be multiplied. And the attempts of Satan to destroy thechurch, always tend to increase the number of true Christians.
Est 9:1-19	<br>The enemies of the Jews hoped to have power over them by the formeredict. If they had attempted nothing against the people of God, theywould not themselves have suffered. The Jews, acting together,strengthened one another. Let us learn to stand fast in one spirit, andwith one mind, striving together against the enemies of our souls, whoendeavour to rob us of our faith, which is more precious than ourlives. The Jews, to the honour of their religion, showed contempt ofwordly wealth, that they might make it appear they desired nothingexcept their own preservation. In every case the people of God shouldmanifest humanity and disinterestedness, frequently refusing advantageswhich might lawfully be obtained. The Jews celebrated their festivalthe day after they had finished their work. When we have received greatmercies from God, we ought to be speedy in making thankful returns tohim.
Est 9:20-32	<br>The observance of the Jewish feasts, is a public declaration of thetruth of the Old Testament Scriptures. And as the Old TestamentScriptures are true, the Messiah expected by the Jews is come long ago;and none but Jesus of Nazareth can be that Messiah. The festival wasappointed by authority, yet under the direction of the Spirit of God.It was called the feast of Purim, from a Persian word, which signifiesa lot. The name of this festival would remind them of the almightypower of the God of Israel, who served his own purposes by thesuperstitions of the heathen. In reviewing our mercies, we shouldadvert to former fears and distresses. When our mercies are personal,we should not by forgetfulness lose the comfort of them, or withholdfrom the Lord the glory due to his name. May the Lord teach us torejoice, with that holy joy which anticipates and prepares for theblessedness of heaven. Every instance of Divine goodness to ourselves,is a new obligation laid on us to do good, to those especially who mostneed our bounty. Above all, redemption by Christ binds us to bemerciful, 2Co 8:9.
Job 1:1-5	<br>Job was prosperous, and yet pious. Though it is hard and rare, it isnot impossible for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of heaven. ByGod's grace the temptations of worldly wealth may be overcome. Theaccount of Job's piety and prosperity comes before the history of hisgreat afflictions, showing that neither will secure from troubles.While Job beheld the harmony and comforts of his sons withsatisfaction, his knowledge of the human heart made him fearful forthem. He sent and sanctified them, reminding them to examinethemselves, to confess their sins, to seek forgiveness; and as one whohoped for acceptance with God through the promised Saviour, he offereda burnt-offering for each. We perceive his care for their souls, hisknowledge of the sinful state of man, his entire dependence on God'smercy in the way he had appointed.
Job 1:6-12	<br>Job's afflictions began from the malice of Satan, by the Lord'spermission, for wise and holy purposes. There is an evil spirit, theenemy of God, and of all righteousness, who is continually seeking todistress, to lead astray, and, if possible, to destroy those who loveGod. How far his influence may extend, we cannot say; but probably muchunsteadiness and unhappiness in Christians may be ascribed to him.While we are on this earth we are within his reach. Hence it concernsus to be sober and vigilant, 1Pe 5:8. See how Satan censures Job. Thisis the common way of slanderers, to suggest that which they have noreason to think is true. But as there is nothing we should dread morethan really being hypocrites, so there is nothing we need dread lessthan being called and counted so without cause. It is not wrong to lookat the eternal recompence in our obedience; but it is wrong to aim atworldly advantages in our religion. God's people are taken under hisspecial protection; they, and all that belong to them. The blessing ofthe Lord makes rich; Satan himself owns it. God suffered Job to betried, as he suffered Peter to be sifted. It is our comfort that Godhas the devil in a chain, Re 20:1. He has no power to lead men to sin,but what they give him themselves; nor any power to afflict men, butwhat is given him from above. All this is here described to us afterthe manner of men. The Scripture speaks thus to teach us that Goddirects the affairs of the world.
Job 1:13-19	<br>Satan brought Job's troubles upon him on the day that his childrenbegan their course of feasting. The troubles all came upon Job at once;while one messenger of evil tidings was speaking, another followed. Hisdearest and most valuable possessions were his ten children; news isbrought him that they are killed. They were taken away when he had mostneed of them to comfort him under other losses. In God only have we ahelp present at all times. (Job 1:20-22)
Job 1:20-22	<br>Job humbled himself under the hand of God. He reasons from the commonstate of human life, which he describes. We brought nothing of thisworld's goods into the world, but have them from others; and it iscertain we can carry nothing out, but must leave them to others. Job,under all his losses, is but reduced to his first state. He is butwhere he must have been at last, and is only unclothed, or unloadedrather, a little sooner than he expected. If we put off our clothesbefore we go to bed, it is some inconvenience, but it may be the betterborne when it is near bed-time. The same who gave hath taken away. Seehow Job looks above instruments, and keeps his eye upon the FirstCause. Afflictions must not divert us from, but quicken us to religion.If in all our troubles we look to the Lord, he will support us. TheLord is righteous. All we have is from his gift; we have forfeited itby sin, and ought not to complain if he takes any part from us.Discontent and impatience charge God with folly. Against these Jobcarefully watched; and so must we, acknowledging that as God has doneright, but we have done wickedly, so God has done wisely, but we havedone very foolishly. And may the malice and power of Satan render thatSaviour more precious to our souls, who came to destroy the works ofthe devil; who, for our salvation, suffered from that enemy far morethan Job suffered, or we can think.
Job 2:1-6	<br>How well is it for us, that neither men nor devils are to be ourjudges! but all our judgment comes from the Lord, who never errs. Jobholds fast his integrity still, as his weapon. God speaks with pleasureof the power of his own grace. Self-love and self-preservation arepowerful in the hearts of men. But Satan accuses Job, representing himas wholly selfish, and minding nothing but his own ease and safety.Thus are the ways and people of God often falsely blamed by the deviland his agents. Permission is granted to Satan to make trial, but witha limit. If God did not chain up the roaring lion, how soon would hedevour us! Job, thus slandered by Satan, was a type of Christ, thefirst prophecy of whom was, that Satan should bruise his heel, and befoiled.
Job 2:7-10	<br>The devil tempts his own children, and draws them to sin, andafterwards torments, when he has brought them to ruin; but this childof God he tormented with affliction, and then tempted to make a bad useof his affliction. He provoked Job to curse God. The disease was verygrievous. If at any time we are tried with sore and grievousdistempers, let us not think ourselves dealt with otherwise than as Godsometimes deals with the best of his saints and servants. Job humbledhimself under the mighty hand of God, and brought his mind to hiscondition. His wife was spared to him, to be a troubler and tempter tohim. Satan still endeavours to draw men from God, as he did our firstparents, by suggesting hard thoughts of Him, than which nothing is morefalse. But Job resisted and overcame the temptation. Shall we, guilty,polluted, worthless creatures, receive so many unmerited blessings froma just and holy God, and shall we refuse to accept the punishment ofour sins, when we suffer so much less than we deserve? Let murmuring,as well as boasting, be for ever done away. Thus far Job stood thetrial, and appeared brightest in the furnace of affliction. There mightbe risings of corruption in his heart, but grace had the upper hand.
Job 2:11-13	<br>The friends of Job seem noted for their rank, as well as for wisdom andpiety. Much of the comfort of this life lies in friendship with theprudent and virtuous. Coming to mourn with him, they vented grief whichthey really felt. Coming to comfort him, they sat down with him. Itwould appear that they suspected his unexampled troubles were judgmentsfor some crimes, which he had vailed under his professions ofgodliness. Many look upon it only as a compliment to visit theirfriends in sorrow; we must look life. And if the example of Job'sfriends is not enough to lead us to pity the afflicted, let us seek themind that was in Christ.
Job 3:1-10	<br>For seven days Job's friends sat by him in silence, without offeringconsolidation: at the same time Satan assaulted his mind to shake hisconfidence, and to fill him with hard thoughts of God. The permissionseems to have extended to this, as well as to torturing the body. Jobwas an especial type of Christ, whose inward sufferings, both in thegarden and on the cross, were the most dreadful; and arose in a greatdegree from the assaults of Satan in that hour of darkness. Theseinward trials show the reason of the change that took place in Job'sconduct, from entire submission to the will of God, to the impatiencewhich appears here, and in other parts of the book. The believer, whoknows that a few drops of this bitter cup are more dreadful than thesharpest outward afflictions, while he is favoured with a sweet senseof the love and presence of God, will not be surprised to find that Jobproved a man of like passions with others; but will rejoice that Satanwas disappointed, and could not prove him a hypocrite; for though hecursed the day of his birth, he did not curse his God. Job doubtlesswas afterwards ashamed of these wishes, and we may suppose what must behis judgment of them now he is in everlasting happiness.
Job 3:11-19	<br>Job complained of those present at his birth, for their tenderattention to him. No creature comes into the world so helpless as man.God's power and providence upheld our frail lives, and his pity andpatience spared our forfeited lives. Natural affection is put intoparents' hearts by God. To desire to die that we may be with Christ,that we may be free from sin, is the effect and evidence of grace; butto desire to die, only that we may be delivered from the troubles ofthis life, savours of corruption. It is our wisdom and duty to make thebest of that which is, be it living or dying; and so to live to theLord, and die to the Lord, as in both to be his, Ro 14:8. Observe howJob describes the repose of the grave; There the wicked cease fromtroubling. When persecutors die, they can no longer persecute. Therethe weary are at rest: in the grave they rest from all their labours.And a rest from sin, temptation, conflict, sorrows, and labours,remains in the presence and enjoyment of God. There believers rest inJesus, nay, as far as we trust in the Lord Jesus and obey him, we herefind rest to our souls, though in the world we have tribulation.
Job 3:20-26	<br>Job was like a man who had lost his way, and had no prospect of escape,or hope of better times. But surely he was in an ill frame for deathwhen so unwilling to live. Let it be our constant care to get ready foranother world, and then leave it to God to order our removal thither ashe thinks fit. Grace teaches us in the midst of life's greatestcomforts, to be willing to die, and in the midst of its greatestcrosses, to be willing to live. Job's way was hid; he knew notwherefore God contended with him. The afflicted and tempted Christianknows something of this heaviness; when he has been looking too much atthe things that are seen, some chastisement of his heavenly Father willgive him a taste of this disgust of life, and a glance at these darkregions of despair. Nor is there any help until God shall restore tohim the joys of his salvation. Blessed be God, the earth is full of hisgoodness, though full of man's wickedness. This life may be madetolerable if we attend to our duty. We look for eternal mercy, ifwilling to receive Christ as our Saviour.
Job 4:1-6	<br>Satan undertook to prove Job a hypocrite by afflicting him; and hisfriends concluded him to be one because he was so afflicted, and showedimpatience. This we must keep in mind if we would understand whatpassed. Eliphaz speaks of Job, and his afflicted condition, withtenderness; but charges him with weakness and faint-heartedness. Menmake few allowances for those who have taught others. Even piousfriends will count that only a touch which we feel as a wound. Learnfrom hence to draw off the mind of a sufferer from brooding over theaffliction, to look at the God of mercies in the affliction. And howcan this be done so well as by looking to Christ Jesus, in whoseunequalled sorrows every child of God soonest learns to forget his own?
Job 4:7-11	<br>Eliphaz argues, 1. That good men were never thus ruined. But there isone event both to the righteous and to the wicked, Ec 9:2, both in lifeand death; the great and certain difference is after death. Our worstmistakes are occasioned by drawing wrong views from undeniable truths.2. That wicked men were often thus ruined: for the proof of this,Eliphaz vouches his own observation. We may see the same every day.
Job 4:12-21	<br>Eliphaz relates a vision. When we are communing with our own hearts,and are still, Ps 4:4, then is a time for the Holy Spirit to communewith us. This vision put him into very great fear. Ever since mansinned, it has been terrible to him to receive communications fromHeaven, conscious that he can expect no good tidings thence. Sinfulman! shall he pretend to be more just, more pure, than God, who beinghis Maker, is his Lord and Owner? How dreadful, then, the pride andpresumption of man! How great the patience of God! Look upon man in hislife. The very foundation of that cottage of clay in which man dwells,is in the dust, and it will sink with its own weight. We stand but uponthe dust. Some have a higher heap of dust to stand upon than others butstill it is the earth that stays us up, and will shortly swallow us up.Man is soon crushed; or if some lingering distemper, which consumeslike a moth, be sent to destroy him, he cannot resist it. Shall such acreature pretend to blame the appointments of God? Look upon man in hisdeath. Life is short, and in a little time men are cut off. Beauty,strength, learning, not only cannot secure them from death, but thesethings die with them; nor shall their pomp, their wealth, or power,continue after them. Shall a weak, sinful, dying creature, pretend tobe more just than God, and more pure than his Maker? No: instead ofquarrelling with his afflictions, let him wonder that he is out ofhell. Can a man be cleansed without his Maker? Will God justify sinfulmortals, and clear them from guilt? or will he do so without theirhaving an interest in the righteousness and gracious help of theirpromised Redeemer, when angels, once ministering spirits before histhrone, receive the just recompence of their sins? Notwithstanding theseeming impunity of men for a short time, though living without God inthe world, their doom is as certain as that of the fallen angels, andis continually overtaking them. Yet careless sinners note it so little,that they expect not the change, nor are wise to consider their latterend.
Job 5:1-5	<br>Eliphaz here calls upon Job to answer his arguments. Were any of thesaints or servants of God visited with such Divine judgments as Job, ordid they ever behave like him under their sufferings? The term,"saints," holy, or more strictly, consecrated ones, seems in all agesto have been applied to the people of God, through the Sacrifice slainin the covenant of their reconciliation. Eliphaz doubts not that thesin of sinners directly tends to their ruin. They kill themselves bysome lust or other; therefore, no doubt, Job has done some foolishthing, by which he has brought himself into this condition. Theallusion was plain to Job's former prosperity; but there was noevidence of Job's wickedness, and the application to him was unfair andsevere.
Job 5:6-16	<br>Eliphaz reminds Job, that no affliction comes by chance, nor is to beplaced to second causes. The difference between prosperity andadversity is not so exactly observed, as that between day and night,summer and winter; but it is according to the will and counsel of God.We must not attribute our afflictions to fortune, for they are fromGod; nor our sins to fate, for they are from ourselves. Man is born insin, and therefore born to trouble. There is nothing in this world weare born to, and can truly call our own, but sin and trouble. Actualtransgressions are sparks that fly out of the furnace of originalcorruption. Such is the frailty of our bodies, and the vanity of allour enjoyments, that our troubles arise thence as the sparks flyupward; so many are they, and so fast does one follow another. Eliphazreproves Job for not seeking God, instead of quarrelling with him. Isany afflicted? let him pray. It is heart's ease, a salve for everysore. Eliphaz speaks of rain, which we are apt to look upon as a littlething; but if we consider how it is produced, and what is produced byit, we shall see it to be a great work of power and goodness. Too oftenthe great Author of all our comforts, and the manner in which they areconveyed to us, are not noticed, because they are received as things ofcourse. In the ways of Providence, the experiences of some areencouragements to others, to hope the best in the worst of times; forit is the glory of God to send help to the helpless, and hope to thehopeless. And daring sinners are confounded, and forced to acknowledgethe justice of God's proceedings.
Job 5:17-27	<br>Eliphaz gives to Job a word of caution and exhortation: Despise notthou the chastening of the Almighty. Call it a chastening, which comesfrom the Father's love, and is for the child's good; and notice it as amessenger from Heaven. Eliphaz also encourages Job to submit to hiscondition. A good man is happy though he be afflicted, for he has notlost his enjoyment of God, nor his title to heaven; nay, he is happybecause he is afflicted. Correction mortifies his corruptions, weanshis heart from the world, draws him nearer to God, brings him to hisBible, brings him to his knees. Though God wounds, yet he supports hispeople under afflictions, and in due time delivers them. Making a woundis sometimes part of a cure. Eliphaz gives Job precious promises ofwhat God would do for him, if he humbled himself. Whatever troublesgood men may be in, they shall do them no real harm. Being kept fromsin, they are kept from the evil of trouble. And if the servants ofChrist are not delivered from outward troubles, they are delivered bythem, and while overcome by one trouble, they conquer all. Whatever ismaliciously said against them shall not hurt them. They shall havewisdom and grace to manage their concerns. The greatest blessing, bothin our employments and in our enjoyments, is to be kept from sin. Theyshall finish their course with joy and honour. That man lives longenough who has done his work, and is fit for another world. It is amercy to die seasonably, as the corn is cut and housed when fully ripe;not till then, but then not suffered to stand any longer. Our times arein God's hands; it is well they are so. Believers are not to expectgreat wealth, long life, or to be free from trials. But all will beordered for the best. And remark from Job's history, that steadiness ofmind and heart under trial, is one of the highest attainments of faith.There is little exercise for faith when all things go well. But if Godraises a storm, permits the enemy to send wave after wave, andseemingly stands aloof from our prayers, then, still to hang on andtrust God, when we cannot trace him, this is the patience of thesaints. Blessed Saviour! how sweet it is to look unto thee, the Authorand Finisher of faith, in such moments!
Job 6:1-7	<br>Job still justifies himself in his complaints. In addition to outwardtroubles, the inward sense of God's wrath took away all his courage andresolution. The feeling sense of the wrath of God is harder to bearthan any outward afflictions. What then did the Saviour endure in thegarden and on the cross, when he bare our sins, and his soul was made asacrifice to Divine justice for us! Whatever burden of affliction, inbody or estate, God is pleased to lay upon us, we may well submit to itas long as he continues to us the use of our reason, and the peace ofour conscience; but if either of these is disturbed, our case is verypitiable. Job reflects upon his friends for their censures. Hecomplains he had nothing offered for his relief, but what was in itselftasteless, loathsome, and burdensome.
Job 6:8-13	<br>Job had desired death as the happy end of his miseries. For this,Eliphaz had reproved him, but he asks for it again with more vehemencethan before. It was very rash to speak thus of God destroying him. Who,for one hour, could endure the wrath of the Almighty, if he let loosehis hand against him? Let us rather say with David, O spare me alittle. Job grounds his comfort upon the testimony of his conscience,that he had been, in some degree, serviceable to the glory of God.Those who have grace in them, who have the evidence of it, and have itin exercise, have wisdom in them, which will be their help in the worstof times.
Job 6:14-30	<br>In his prosperity Job formed great expectations from his friends, butnow was disappointed. This he compares to the failing of brooks insummer. Those who rest their expectations on the creature, will find itfail when it should help them; whereas those who make God theirconfidence, have help in the time of need, Heb 4:16. Those who makegold their hope, sooner or later will be ashamed of it, and of theirconfidence in it. It is our wisdom to cease from man. Let us put allour confidence in the Rock of ages, not in broken reeds; in theFountain of life, not in broken cisterns. The application is veryclose; "for now ye are nothing." It were well for us, if we had alwayssuch convictions of the vanity of the creature, as we have had, orshall have, on a sick-bed, a death-bed, or in trouble of conscience.Job upbraids his friends with their hard usage. Though in want, hedesired no more from them than a good look and a good word. It oftenhappens that, even when we expect little from man, we have less; butfrom God, even when we expect much, we have more. Though Job differedfrom them, yet he was ready to yield as soon as it was made to appearthat he was in error. Though Job had been in fault, yet they ought notto have given him such hard usage. His righteousness he holds fast, andwill not let it go. He felt that there had not been such iniquity inhim as they supposed. But it is best to commit our characters to Himwho keeps our souls; in the great day every upright believer shall havepraise of God.
Job 7:1-6	<br>Job here excuses what he could not justify, his desire of death.Observe man's present place: he is upon earth. He is yet on earth, notin hell. Is there not a time appointed for his abode here? yes,certainly, and the appointment is made by Him who made us and sent ushere. During that, man's life is a warfare, and as day-labourers, whohave the work of the day to do in its day, and must make up theiraccount at night. Job had as much reason, he thought, to wish fordeath, as a poor servant that is tired with his work, has to wish forthe shadows of the evening, when he shall go to rest. The sleep of thelabouring man is sweet; nor can any rich man take so much satisfactionin his wealth, as the hireling in his day's wages. The comparison isplain; hear his complaint: His days were useless, and had long been so;but when we are not able to work for God, if we sit still quietly forhim, we shall be accepted. His nights were restless. Whatever isgrievous, it is good to see it appointed for us, and as designed forsome holy end. When we have comfortable nights, we must see them alsoappointed to us, and be thankful for them. His body was noisome. Seewhat vile bodies we have. His life was hastening apace. While we areliving, every day, like the shuttle, leaves a thread behind: many weavethe spider's web, which will fail, ch. 8:14. But if, while we live, welive unto the Lord, in works of faith and labours of love, we shallhave the benefit, for every man shall reap as he sowed, and wear as hewove.
Job 7:7-16	<br>Plain truths as to the shortness and vanity of man's life, and thecertainty of death, do us good, when we think and speak of them withapplication to ourselves. Dying is done but once, and therefore it hadneed be well done. An error here is past retrieve. Other clouds arise,but the same cloud never returns: so a new generation of men is raisedup, but the former generation vanishes away. Glorified saints shallreturn no more to the cares and sorrows of their houses; nor condemnedsinners to the gaieties and pleasures of their houses. It concerns usto secure a better place when we die. From these reasons Job might havedrawn a better conclusion than this, I will complain. When we have buta few breaths to draw, we should spend them in the holy, graciousbreathings of faith and prayer; not in the noisome, noxious breathingsof sin and corruption. We have much reason to pray, that He who keepsIsrael, and neither slumbers nor sleeps, may keep us when we slumberand sleep. Job covets to rest in his grave. Doubtless, this was hisinfirmity; for though a good man would choose death rather than sin,yet he should be content to live as long as God pleases, because lifeis our opportunity of glorifying him, and preparing for heaven.
Job 7:17-21	<br>Job reasons with God concerning his dealings with man. But in the midstof this discourse, Job seems to have lifted up his thoughts to God withsome faith and hope. Observe the concern he is in about his sins. Thebest men have to complain of sin; and the better they are, the morethey will complain of it. God is the Preserver of our lives, and theSaviour of the souls of all that believe; but probably Job meant theObserver of men, whose eyes are upon the ways and hearts of all men. Wecan hide nothing from Him; let us plead guilty before his throne ofgrace, that we may not be condemned at his judgment-seat. Jobmaintained, against his friends, that he was not a hypocrite, not awicked man, yet he owns to his God, that he had sinned. The best mustso acknowledge, before the Lord. He seriously inquires how he might beat peace with God, and earnestly begs forgiveness of his sins. He meansmore than the removing of his outward trouble, and is earnest for thereturn of God's favour. Wherever the Lord removes the guilt of sin, hebreaks the power of sin. To strengthen his prayer for pardon, Jobpleads the prospect he had of dying quickly. If my sins be not pardonedwhile I live, I am lost and undone for ever. How wretched is sinful manwithout a knowledge of the Saviour!
Job 8:1-7	<br>Job spake much to the purpose; but Bildad, like an eager, angrydisputant, turns it all off with this, How long wilt thou speak thesethings? Men's meaning is not taken aright, and then they are rebuked,as if they were evil-doers. Even in disputes on religion, it is toocommon to treat others with sharpness, and their arguments withcontempt. Bildad's discourse shows that he had not a favourable opinionof Job's character. Job owned that God did not pervert judgment; yet itdid not therefore follow that his children were cast-aways, or thatthey did for some great transgression. Extraordinary afflictions arenot always the punishment of extraordinary sins, sometimes they are thetrials of extraordinary graces: in judging of another's case, we oughtto take the favorable side. Bildad puts Job in hope, that if he wereindeed upright, he should yet see a good end of his present troubles.This is God's way of enriching the souls of his people with graces andcomforts. The beginning is small, but the progress is to perfection.Dawning light grows to noon-day.
Job 8:8-19	<br>Bildad discourses well of hypocrites and evil-doers, and the fatal endof all their hopes and joys. He proves this truth of the destruction ofthe hopes and joys of hypocrites, by an appeal to former times. Bildadrefers to the testimony of the ancients. Those teach best that utterwords out of their heart, that speak from an experience of spiritualand divine things. A rush growing in fenny ground, looking very green,but withering in dry weather, represents the hypocrite's profession,which is maintained only in times of prosperity. The spider's web, spunwith great skill, but easily swept away, represents a man's pretensionsto religion when without the grace of God in his heart. A formalprofessor flatters himself in his own eyes, doubts not of hissalvation, is secure, and cheats the world with his vain confidences.The flourishing of the tree, planted in the garden, striking root tothe rock, yet after a time cut down and thrown aside, represents wickedmen, when most firmly established, suddenly thrown down and forgotten.This doctrine of the vanity of a hypocrite's confidence, or theprosperity of a wicked man, is sound; but it was not applicable to thecase of Job, if confined to the present world.
Job 8:20-22	<br>Bildad here assures Job, that as he was so he should fare; thereforethey concluded, that as he fared so he was. God will not cast away anupright man; he may be cast down for a time, but he shall not be castaway for ever. Sin brings ruin on persons and families. Yet to argue,that Job was an ungodly, wicked man, was unjust and uncharitable. Themistake in these reasonings arose from Job's friends not distinguishingbetween the present state of trial and discipline, and the future stateof final judgment. May we choose the portion, possess the confidence,bear the cross, and die the death of the righteous; and, in the meantime, be careful neither to wound others by rash judgments, nor todistress ourselves needlessly about the opinions of ourfellow-creatures.
Job 9:1-13	<br>In this answer Job declared that he did not doubt the justice of God,when he denied himself to be a hypocrite; for how should man be justwith God? Before him he pleaded guilty of sins more than could becounted; and if God should contend with him in judgment, he could notjustify one out of a thousand, of all the thoughts, words, and actionsof his life; therefore he deserved worse than all his presentsufferings. When Job mentions the wisdom and power of God, he forgetshis complaints. We are unfit to judge of God's proceedings, because weknow not what he does, or what he designs. God acts with power which nocreature can resist. Those who think they have strength enough to helpothers, will not be able to help themselves against it.
Job 9:14-21	<br>Job is still righteous in his own eyes, ch. 32:1, and this answer,though it sets forth the power and majesty of God, implies that thequestion between the afflicted and the Lord of providence, is aquestion of might, and not of right; and we begin to discover the evilfruits of pride and of a self-righteous spirit. Job begins to manifesta disposition to condemn God, that he may justify himself, for which heis afterwards reproved. Still Job knew so much of himself, that hedurst not stand a trial. If we say, We have no sin, we not only deceiveourselves, but we affront God; for we sin in saying so, and give thelie to the Scripture. But Job reflected on God's goodness and justicein saying his affliction was without cause.
Job 9:22-24	<br>Job touches briefly upon the main point now in dispute. His friendsmaintained that those who are righteous and good, always prosper inthis world, and that none but the wicked are in misery and distress: hesaid, on the contrary, that it is a common thing for the wicked toprosper, and the righteous to be greatly afflicted. Yet there is toomuch passion in what Job here says, for God doth not afflict willingly.When the spirit is heated with dispute or with discontent, we have needto set a watch before our lips.
Job 9:25-35	<br>What little need have we of pastimes, and what great need to redeemtime, when it runs on so fast towards eternity! How vain the enjoymentsof time, which we may quite lose while yet time continues! Theremembrance of having done our duty will be pleasing afterwards; sowill not the remembrance of having got worldly wealth, when it is alllost and gone. Job's complaint of God, as one that could not beappeased and would not relent, was the language of his corruption.There is a Mediator, a Daysman, or Umpire, for us, even God's ownbeloved Son, who has purchased peace for us with the blood of hiscross, who is able to save to the uttermost all who come unto Godthrough him. If we trust in his name, our sins will be buried in thedepths of the sea, we shall be washed from all our filthiness, and madewhiter than snow, so that none can lay any thing to our charge. Weshall be clothed with the robes of righteousness and salvation, adornedwith the graces of the Holy Spirit, and presented faultless before thepresence of his glory with exceeding joy. May we learn the differencebetween justifying ourselves, and being thus justified by God himself.Let the tempest-tossed soul consider Job, and notice that others havepassed this dreadful gulf; and though they found it hard to believethat God would hear or deliver them, yet he rebuked the storm, andbrought them to the desired haven. Resist the devil; give not place tohard thoughts of God, or desperate conclusions about thyself. Come toHim who invites the weary and heavy laden; who promises in nowise tocast them out.
Job 10:1-7	<br>Job, being weary of his life, resolves to complain, but he will notcharge God with unrighteousness. Here is a prayer that he might bedelivered from the sting of his afflictions, which is sin. When Godafflicts us, he contends with us; when he contends with us, there isalways a reason; and it is desirable to know the reason, that we mayrepent of and forsake the sin for which God has a controversy with us.But when, like Job, we speak in the bitterness of our souls, weincrease guilt and vexation. Let us harbour no hard thoughts of God; weshall hereafter see there was no cause for them. Job is sure that Goddoes not discover things, nor judge of them, as men do; therefore hethinks it strange that God continues him under affliction, as if hemust take time to inquire into his sin.
Job 10:8-13	<br>Job seems to argue with God, as if he only formed and preserved him formisery. God made us, not we ourselves. How sad that those bodies shouldbe instruments of unrighteousness, which are capable of being templesof the Holy Ghost! But the soul is the life, the soul is the man, andthis is the gift of God. If we plead with ourselves as an inducement toduty, God made me and maintains me, we may plead as an argument formercy, Thou hast made me, do thou new-make me; I am thine, save me.
Job 10:14-22	<br>Job did not deny that as a sinner he deserved his sufferings; but hethought that justice was executed upon him with peculiar rigour. Hisgloom, unbelief, and hard thoughts of God, were as much to be ascribedto Satan's inward temptations, and his anguish of soul, under the senseof God's displeasure, as to his outward trials, and remainingdepravity. Our Creator, become in Christ our Redeemer also, will notdestroy the work of his hands in any humble believer; but will renewhim unto holiness, that he may enjoy eternal life. If anguish on earthrenders the grave a desirable refuge, what will be their condition whoare condemned to the blackness of darkness for ever? Let every sinnerseek deliverance from that dreadful state, and every believer bethankful to Jesus, who delivereth from the wrath to come.
Job 11:1-6	<br>Zophar attacked Job with great vehemence. He represented him as a manthat loved to hear himself speak, though he could say nothing to thepurpose, and as a man that maintained falsehoods. He desired God wouldshow Job that less punishment was exacted than he deserved. We areready, with much assurance, to call God to act in our quarrels, and tothink that if he would but speak, he would take our part. We ought toleave all disputes to the judgment of God, which we are sure isaccording to truth; but those are not always right who are most forwardto appeal to the Divine judgment.
Job 11:7-12	<br>Zophar speaks well concerning God and his greatness and glory,concerning man and his vanity and folly. See here what man is; and lethim be humbled. God sees this concerning vain man, that he would bewise, would be thought so, though he is born like a wild ass's colt, sounteachable and untameable. Man is a vain creature; empty, so the wordis. Yet he is a proud creature, and self-conceited. He would be wise,would be thought so, though he will not submit to the laws of wisdom.He would be wise, he reaches after forbidden wisdom, and, like hisfirst parents, aiming to be wise above what is written, loses the treeof life for the tree of knowledge. Is such a creature as this fit tocontend with God?
Job 11:13-20	<br>Zophar exhorts Job to repentance, and gives him encouragement, yetmixed with hard thoughts of him. He thought that worldly prosperity wasalways the lot of the righteous, and that Job was to be deemed ahypocrite unless his prosperity was restored. Then shalt thou lift upthy face without spot; that is, thou mayst come boldly to the throne ofgrace, and not with the terror and amazement expressed in ch. 9:34. Ifwe are looked upon in the face of the Anointed, our faces that werecast down may be lifted up; though polluted, being now washed with theblood of Christ, they may be lifted up without spot. We may draw nearin full assurance of faith, when we are sprinkled from an evilconscience, Heb 10:22.
Job 12:1-5	<br>Job upbraids his friends with the good opinion they had of their ownwisdom compared with his. We are apt to call reproofs reproaches, andto think ourselves mocked when advised and admonished; this is ourfolly; yet here was colour for this charge. He suspected the true causeof their conduct to be, that they despised him who was fallen intopoverty. It is the way of the world. Even the just, upright man, if hecomes under a cloud, is looked upon with contempt.
Job 12:6-11	<br>Job appeals to facts. The most audacious robbers, oppressors, andimpious wretches, often prosper. Yet this is not by fortune or chance;the Lord orders these things. Worldly prosperity is of small value inhis sight: he has better things for his children. Job resolves all intothe absolute proprietorship which God has in all the creatures. Hedemands from his friends liberty to judge of what they had said; heappeals to any fair judgment. (Job 12:12-25)
Job 12:12-25	<br>This is a noble discourse of Job concerning the wisdom, power, andsovereignty of God, in ordering all the affairs of the children of men,according to the counsel of His own will, which none can resist. Itwere well if wise and good men, who differ about lesser things, wouldsee how it is for their honour and comfort, and the good of others, todwell most upon the great things in which they agree. Here are nocomplaints, or reflections. He gives many instances of God's powerfulmanagement of the children of men, overruling all their counsels, andovercoming all their oppositions. Having all strength and wisdom, Godknows how to make use, even of those who are foolish and bad; otherwisethere is so little wisdom and so little honesty in the world, that allhad been in confusion and ruin long ago. These important truths weresuited to convince the disputants that they were out of their depth inattempting to assign the Lord's reasons for afflicting Job; his waysare unsearchable, and his judgments past finding out. Let us remarkwhat beautiful illustrations there are in the word of God, confirminghis sovereignty, and wisdom in that sovereignty: but the highest andinfinitely the most important is, that the Lord Jesus was crucified bythe malice of the Jews; and who but the Lord could have known that thisone event was the salvation of the world?
Job 13:1-12	<br>With self-preference, Job declared that he needed not to be taught bythem. Those who dispute are tempted to magnify themselves, and lowertheir brethren, more than is fit. When dismayed or distressed with thefear of wrath, the force of temptation, or the weight of affliction, weshould apply to the Physician of our souls, who never rejects any,never prescribes amiss, and never leaves any case uncured. To Him wemay speak at all times. To broken hearts and wounded consciences, allcreatures, without Christ, are physicians of no value. Job evidentlyspeaks with a very angry spirit against his friends. They had advancedsome truths which nearly concerned Job, but the heart unhumbled beforeGod, never meekly receives the reproofs of men.
Job 13:13-22	<br>Job resolved to cleave to the testimony his own conscience gave of hisuprightness. He depended upon God for justification and salvation, thetwo great things we hope for through Christ. Temporal salvation helittle expected, but of his eternal salvation he was very confident;that God would not only be his Saviour to make him happy, but hissalvation, in the sight and enjoyment of whom he should be happy. Heknew himself not to be a hypocrite, and concluded that he should not berejected. We should be well pleased with God as a Friend, even when heseems against us as an enemy. We must believe that all shall work forgood to us, even when all seems to make against us. We must cleave toGod, yea, though we cannot for the present find comfort in him. In adying hour, we must derive from him living comforts; and this is totrust in him, though he slay us.
Job 13:23-28	<br>Job begs to have his sins discovered to him. A true penitent is willingto know the worst of himself; and we should all desire to know what ourtransgressions are, that we may confess them, and guard against themfor the future. Job complains sorrowfully of God's severe dealings withhim. Time does not wear out the guilt of sin. When God writes bitterthings against us, his design is to make us bring forgotten sins tomind, and so to bring us to repent of them, as to break us off fromthem. Let young persons beware of indulging in sin. Even in this worldthey may so possess the sins of their youth, as to have months ofsorrow for moments of pleasure. Their wisdom is to remember theirCreator in their early days, that they may have assured hope, and sweetpeace of conscience, as the solace of their declining years. Job alsocomplains that his present mistakes are strictly noticed. So far fromthis, God deals not with us according to our deserts. This was thelanguage of Job's melancholy views. If God marks our steps, andnarrowly examines our paths, in judgment, both body and soul feel hisrighteous vengeance. This will be the awful case of unbelievers, yetthere is salvation devised, provided, and made known in Christ.
Job 14:1-6	<br>Job enlarges upon the condition of man, addressing himself also to God.Every man of Adam's fallen race is short-lived. All his show of beauty,happiness, and splendour falls before the stroke of sickness or death,as the flower before the scythe; or passes away like the shadow. How isit possible for a man's conduct to be sinless, when his heart is bynature unclean? Here is a clear proof that Job understood and believedthe doctrine of original sin. He seems to have intended it as a plea,why the Lord should not deal with him according to his own works, butaccording to His mercy and grace. It is determined, in the counsel anddecree of God, how long we shall live. Our times are in his hands, thepowers of nature act under him; in him we live and move. And it is veryuseful to reflect seriously on the shortness and uncertainty of humanlife, and the fading nature of all earthly enjoyments. But it is stillmore important to look at the cause, and remedy of these evils. Untilwe are born of the Spirit, no spiritually good thing dwells in us, orcan proceed from us. Even the little good in the regenerate is defiledwith sin. We should therefore humble ourselves before God, and castourselves wholly on the mercy of God, through our Divine Surety. Weshould daily seek the renewing of the Holy Ghost, and look to heaven asthe only place of perfect holiness and happiness.
Job 14:7-15	<br>Though a tree is cut down, yet, in a moist situation, shoots comeforth, and grow up as a newly planted tree. But when man is cut off bydeath, he is for ever removed from his place in this world. The life ofman may fitly be compared to the waters of a land flood, which spreadfar, but soon dry up. All Job's expressions here show his belief in thegreat doctrine of the resurrection. Job's friends proving miserablecomforters, he pleases himself with the expectation of a change. If oursins are forgiven, and our hearts renewed to holiness, heaven will bethe rest of our souls, while our bodies are hidden in the grave fromthe malice of our enemies, feeling no more pain from our corruptions,or our corrections.
Job 14:16-22	<br>Job's faith and hope spake, and grace appeared to revive; but depravityagain prevailed. He represents God as carrying matters to extremityagainst him. The Lord must prevail against all who contend with him.God may send disease and pain, we may lose all comfort in those nearand dear to us, every hope of earthly happiness may be destroyed, butGod will receive the believer into realms of eternal happiness. Butwhat a change awaits the prosperous unbeliever! How will he answer whenGod shall call him to his tribunal? The Lord is yet upon a mercy-seat,ready to be gracious. Oh that sinners would be wise, that they wouldconsider their latter end! While man's flesh is upon him, that is, thebody he is so loth to lay down, it shall have pain; and while his soulis within him, that is, the spirit he is so loth to resign, it shallmourn. Dying work is hard work; dying pangs often are sore pangs. It isfolly for men to defer repentance to a death-bed, and to have that todo which is the one thing needful, when unfit to do anything.
Job 15:1-16	<br>Eliphaz begins a second attack upon Job, instead of being softened byhis complaints. He unjustly charges Job with casting off the fear ofGod, and all regard to him, and restraining prayer. See in whatreligion is summed up, fearing God, and praying to him; the former themost needful principle, the latter the most needful practice. Eliphazcharges Job with self-conceit. He charges him with contempt of thecounsels and comforts given him by his friends. We are apt to thinkthat which we ourselves say is important, when others, with reason,think little of it. He charges him with opposition to God. Eliphazought not to have put harsh constructions upon the words of one wellknown for piety, and now in temptation. It is plain that thesedisputants were deeply convinced of the doctrine of original sin, andthe total depravity of human nature. Shall we not admire the patienceof God in bearing with us? and still more his love to us in theredemption of Christ Jesus his beloved Son?
Job 15:17-35	<br>Eliphaz maintains that the wicked are certainly miserable: whence hewould infer, that the miserable are certainly wicked, and therefore Jobwas so. But because many of God's people have prospered in this world,it does not therefore follow that those who are crossed and made poor,as Job, are not God's people. Eliphaz shows also that wicked people,particularly oppressors, are subject to continual terror, live veryuncomfortably, and perish very miserably. Will the prosperity ofpresumptuous sinners end miserably as here described? Then let themischiefs which befal others, be our warnings. Though no chastening forthe present seemeth to be joyous, but grievous, nevertheless, afterwardit yieldeth the peaceable fruits of righteousness to them that areexercised thereby. No calamity, no trouble, however heavy, howeversevere, can rob a follower of the Lord of his favour. What shallseparate him from the love of Christ?
Job 16:1-5	<br>Eliphaz had represented Job's discourses as unprofitable, and nothingto the purpose; Job here gives his the same character. Those who passcensures, must expect to have them retorted; it is easy, it is endless,but what good does it do? Angry answers stir up men's passions, butnever convince their judgments, nor set truth in a clear light. WhatJob says of his friends is true of all creatures, in comparison withGod; one time or other we shall be made to see and own that miserablecomforters are they all. When under convictions of sin, terrors ofconscience, or the arrests of death, only the blessed Spirit cancomfort effectually; all others, without him, do it miserably, and tono purpose. Whatever our brethren's sorrows are, we ought by sympathyto make them our own; they may soon be so.
Job 16:6-16	<br>Here is a doleful representation of Job's grievances. What reason wehave to bless God, that we are not making such complaints! Even goodmen, when in great troubles, have much ado not to entertain hardthoughts of God. Eliphaz had represented Job as unhumbled under hisaffliction: No, says Job, I know better things; the dust is now thefittest place for me. In this he reminds us of Christ, who was a man ofsorrows, and pronounced those blessed that mourn, for they shall becomforted.
Job 16:17-22	<br>Job's condition was very deplorable; but he had the testimony of hisconscience for him, that he never allowed himself in any gross sin. Noone was ever more ready to acknowledge sins of infirmity. Eliphaz hadcharged him with hypocrisy in religion, but he specifies prayer, thegreat act of religion, and professes that in this he was pure, thoughnot from all infirmity. He had a God to go to, who he doubted not tookfull notice of all his sorrows. Those who pour out tears before God,though they cannot plead for themselves, by reason of their defects,have a Friend to plead for them, even the Son of man, and on him wemust ground all our hopes of acceptance with God. To die, is to go theway whence we shall not return. We must all of us, very certainly, andvery shortly, go this journey. Should not then the Saviour be preciousto our souls? And ought we not to be ready to obey and to suffer forhis sake? If our consciences are sprinkled with his atoning blood, andtestify that we are not living in sin or hypocrisy, when we go the waywhence we shall not return, it will be a release from prison, and anentrance into everlasting happiness.
Job 17:1-9	<br>Job reflects upon the harsh censures his friends had passed upon him,and, looking on himself as a dying man, he appeals to God. Our time isending. It concerns us carefully to redeem the days of time, and tospend them in getting ready for eternity. We see the good use therighteous should make of Job's afflictions from God, from enemies, andfrom friends. Instead of being discouraged in the service of God, bythe hard usage this faithful servant of God met with, they should bemade bold to proceed and persevere therein. Those who keep their eyeupon heaven as their end, will keep their feet in the paths of religionas their way, whatever difficulties and discouragements they may meetwith.
Job 17:10-16	<br>Job's friends had pretended to comfort him with the hope of his returnto a prosperous estate; he here shows that those do not go wisely aboutthe work of comforting the afflicted, who fetch their comforts from thepossibility of recovery in this world. It is our wisdom to comfortourselves, and others, in distress, with that which will not fail; thepromise of God, his love and grace, and a well-grounded hope of eternallife. See how Job reconciles himself to the grave. Let this makebelievers willing to die; it is but going to bed; they are weary, andit is time that they were in their beds. Why should not they gowillingly when their Father calls them? Let us remember our bodies areallied to corruption, the worm and the dust; and let us seek for thatlively hope which shall be fulfilled, when the hope of the wicked shallbe put out in darkness; that when our bodies are in the grave, oursouls may enjoy the rest reserved for the people of God.
Job 18:1-4	<br>Bildad had before given Job good advice and encouragement; here he usednothing but rebukes, and declared his ruin. And he concluded that Jobshut out the providence of God from the management of human affairs,because he would not admit himself to be wicked.
Job 18:5-10	<br>Bildad describes the miserable condition of a wicked man; in whichthere is much certain truth, if we consider that a sinful condition isa sad condition, and that sin will be men's ruin, if they do notrepent. Though Bildad thought the application of it to Job was easy,yet it was not safe nor just. It is common for angry disputants to ranktheir opponents among God's enemies, and to draw wrong conclusions fromimportant truths. The destruction of the wicked is foretold. Thatdestruction is represented under the similitude of a beast or birdcaught in a snare, or a malefactor taken into custody. Satan, as he wasa murderer, so he was a robber, from the beginning. He, the tempter,lays snares for sinners wherever they go. If he makes them sinful likehimself, he will make them miserable like himself. Satan hunts for theprecious life. In the transgression of an evil man there is a snare forhimself, and God is preparing for his destruction. See here how thesinner runs himself into the snare.
Job 18:11-21	<br>Bildad describes the destruction wicked people are kept for, in theother world, and which in some degree, often seizes them in this world.The way of sin is the way of fear, and leads to everlasting confusion,of which the present terrors of an impure conscience are earnests, asin Cain and Judas. Miserable indeed is a wicked man's death, how securesoever his life was. See him dying; all that he trusts to for hissupport shall be taken from him. How happy are the saints, and howindebted to the lord Jesus, by whom death is so far done away andchanged, that this king of terrors is become a friend and a servant!See the wicked man's family sunk and cut off. His children shallperish, either with him or after him. Those who consult the true honourof their family, and its welfare, will be afraid of withering all bysin. The judgments of God follow the wicked man after death in thisworld, as a proof of the misery his soul is in after death, and as anearnest of that everlasting shame and contempt to which he shall risein the great day. The memory of the just is blessed, but the name ofthe wicked shall rot, Pr 10:7. It would be well if this report ofwicked men would cause any to flee from the wrath to come, from whichtheir power, policy, and riches cannot deliver them. But Jesus everliveth to deliver all who trust in him. Bear up then, sufferingbelievers. Ye shall for a little time have sorrow, but your Beloved,your Saviour, will see you again; your hearts shall rejoice, and yourjoy no man taketh away.
Job 19:1-7	<br>Job's friends blamed him as a wicked man, because he was so afflicted;here he describes their unkindness, showing that what they condemnedwas capable of excuse. Harsh language from friends, greatly adds to theweight of afflictions: yet it is best not to lay it to heart, lest weharbour resentment. Rather let us look to Him who endured thecontradiction of sinners against himself, and was treated with far morecruelty than Job was, or we can be. (Job 19:8-22)
Job 19:8-22	<br>How doleful are Job's complaints! What is the fire of hell but thewrath of God! Seared consciences will feel it hereafter, but do notfear it now: enlightened consciences fear it now, but shall not feel ithereafter. It is a very common mistake to think that those whom Godafflicts he treats as his enemies. Every creature is that to us whichGod makes it to be; yet this does not excuse Job's relations andfriends. How uncertain is the friendship of men! but if God be ourFriend, he will not fail us in time of need. What little reason we haveto indulge the body, which, after all our care, is consumed by diseasesit has in itself. Job recommends himself to the compassion of hisfriends, and justly blames their harshness. It is very distressing toone who loves God, to be bereaved at once of outward comfort and ofinward consolation; yet if this, and more, come upon a believer, itdoes not weaken the proof of his being a child of God and heir ofglory.
Job 19:23-29	<br>The Spirit of God, at this time, seems to have powerfully wrought onthe mind of Job. Here he witnessed a good confession; declared thesoundness of his faith, and the assurance of his hope. Here is much ofChrist and heaven; and he that said such things are these, declaredplainly that he sought the better country, that is, the heavenly. Jobwas taught of God to believe in a living Redeemer; to look for theresurrection of the dead, and the life of the world to come; hecomforted himself with the expectation of these. Job was assured, thatthis Redeemer of sinners from the yoke of Satan and the condemnation ofsin, was his Redeemer, and expected salvation through him; and that hewas a living Redeemer, though not yet come in the flesh; and that atthe last day he would appear as the Judge of the world, to raise thedead, and complete the redemption of his people. With what pleasureholy Job enlarges upon this! May these faithful sayings be engraved bythe Holy Spirit upon our hearts. We are all concerned to see that theroot of the matter be in us. A living, quickening, commanding principleof grace in the heart, is the root of the matter; as necessary to ourreligion as the root of the tree, to which it owes both its fixednessand its fruitfulness. Job and his friends differed concerning themethods of Providence, but they agreed in the root of the matter, thebelief of another world.
Job 20:1-9	<br>Zophar's discourse is upon the certain misery of the wicked. Thetriumph of the wicked and the joy of the hypocrite are fleeting. Thepleasures and gains of sin bring disease and pain; they end in remorse,anguish, and ruin. Dissembled piety is double iniquity, and the ruinthat attends it will be accordingly.
Job 20:10-22	<br>The miserable condition of the wicked man in this world is fully setforth. The lusts of the flesh are here called the sins of his youth.His hiding it and keeping it under his tongue, denotes concealment ofhis beloved lust, and delight therein. But He who knows what is in theheart, knows what is under the tongue, and will discover it. The loveof the world, and of the wealth of it, also is wickedness, and man setshis heart upon these. Also violence and injustice, these sins bringGod's judgments upon nations and families. Observe the punishment ofthe wicked man for these things. Sin is turned into gall, than whichnothing is more bitter; it will prove to him poison; so will allunlawful gains be. In his fulness he shall be in straits, through theanxieties of his own mind. To be led by the sanctifying grace of God torestore what was unjustly gotten, as Zaccheus was, is a great mercy.But to be forced to restore by the horrors of a despairing conscience,as Judas was, has no benefit and comfort attending it.
Job 20:23-29	<br>Zophar, having described the vexations which attend wicked practices,shows their ruin from God's wrath. There is no fence against this, butin Christ, who is the only Covert from the storm and tempest, Isa 32:2.Zophar concludes, "This is the portion of a wicked man from God;" it isallotted him. Never was any doctrine better explained, or worseapplied, than this by Zophar, who intended to prove Job a hypocrite.Let us receive the good explanation, and make a better application, forwarning to ourselves, to stand in awe and sin not. One view of Jesus,directed by the Holy Spirit, and by him suitably impressed upon oursouls, will quell a thousand carnal reasonings about the suffering ofthe faithful.
Job 21:1-6	<br>Job comes closer to the question in dispute. This was, Whether outwardprosperity is a mark of the true church, and the true members of it, sothat ruin of a man's prosperity proves him a hypocrite? This theyasserted, but Job denied. If they looked upon him, they might seemisery enough to demand compassion, and their bold interpretations ofthis mysterious providence should be turned into silent wonder.
Job 21:7-16	<br>Job says, Remarkable judgments are sometimes brought upon notorioussinners, but not always. Wherefore is it so? This is the day of God'spatience; and, in some way or other, he makes use of the prosperity ofthe wicked to serve his own counsels, while it ripens them for ruin;but the chief reason is, because he will make it appear there isanother world. These prospering sinners make light of God and religion,as if because they have so much of this world, they had no need to lookafter another. But religion is not a vain thing. If it be so to us, wemay thank ourselves for resting on the outside of it. Job shows theirfolly.
Job 21:17-26	<br>Job had described the prosperity of wicked people; in these verses heopposes this to what his friends had maintained about their certainruin in this life. He reconciles this to the holiness and justice ofGod. Even while they prosper thus, they are light and worthless, of noaccount with God, or with wise men. In the height of their pomp andpower, there is but a step between them and ruin. Job refers thedifference Providence makes between one wicked man and another, intothe wisdom of God. He is Judge of all the earth, and he will do right.So vast is the disproportion between time and eternity, that if hell bethe lot of every sinner at last, it makes little difference if one goessinging thither, and another sighing. If one wicked man die in apalace, and another in a dungeon, the worm that dies not, and the firethat is not quenched, will be the same to them. Thus differences inthis world are not worth perplexing ourselves about.
Job 21:27-34	<br>Job opposes the opinion of his friends, That the wicked are sure tofall into visible and remarkable ruin, and none but the wicked; uponwhich principle they condemned Job as wicked. Turn to whom you will,you will find that the punishment of sinners is designed more for theother world than for this, Jude 1:14,15. The sinner is here supposedto live in a great deal of power. The sinner shall have a splendidfuneral: a poor thing for any man to be proud of the prospect of. Heshall have a stately monument. And a valley with springs of water tokeep the turf green, was accounted an honourable burial place amongeastern people; but such things are vain distinctions. Death closes hisprosperity. It is but a poor encouragement to die, that others havedied before us. That which makes a man die with true courage, is, withfaith to remember that Jesus Christ died and was laid in the grave, notonly before us, but for us. That He hath gone before us, and died forus, who is alive and liveth for us, is true consolation in the hour ofdeath.
Job 22:1-4	<br>Eliphaz considers that, because Job complained so much of hisafflictions, he thought God was unjust in afflicting him; but Job wasfar from thinking so. What Eliphaz says, is unjustly applied to Job,but it is very true, that when God does us good it is not because he isindebted to us. Man's piety is no profit to God, no gain. The gains ofreligion to men are infinitely greater than the losses of it. God is aSovereign, who gives no account of his conduct; but he is perfectlywise, just, faithful, good, and merciful. He approves the likeness ofhis own holiness, and delights in the fruits of his Spirit; he acceptsthe thankful services of the humble believer, while he rejects theproud claim of the self-confident.
Job 22:5-14	<br>Eliphaz brought heavy charges against Job, without reason for hisaccusations, except that Job was visited as he supposed God alwaysvisited every wicked man. He charges him with oppression, and that hedid harm with his wealth and power in the time of his prosperity.
Job 22:15-20	<br>Eliphaz would have Job mark the old way that wicked men have trodden,and see what the end of their way was. It is good for us to mark it,that we may not walk therein. But if others are consumed, and we arenot, instead of blaming them, and lifting up ourselves, as Eliphaz doeshere, we ought to be thankful to God, and take it for a warning.
Job 22:21-30	<br>The answer of Eliphaz wrongly implied that Job had hitherto not knownGod, and that prosperity in this life would follow his sincereconversion. The counsel Eliphaz here gives is good, though, as to Job,it was built upon a false supposition that he was a stranger and enemyto God. Let us beware of slandering our brethren; and if it be our lotto suffer in this manner, let us remember how Job was treated; yea, howJesus was reviled, that we may be patient. Let us examine whether theremay not be some colour for the slander, and walk watchfully, so as tobe clear of all appearances of evil.
Job 23:1-7	<br>Job appeals from his friends to the just judgement of God. He wants tohave his cause tried quickly. Blessed be God, we may know where to findhim. He is in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself; and upon amercy-seat, waiting to be gracious. Thither the sinner may go; andthere the believer may order his cause before Him, with arguments takenfrom his promises, his covenant, and his glory. A patient waiting fordeath and judgment is our wisdom and duty, and it cannot be without aholy fear and trembling. A passionate wishing for death or judgement isour sin and folly, and ill becomes us, as it did Job.
Job 23:8-12	<br>Job knew that the Lord was every where present; but his mind was insuch confusion, that he could get no fixed view of God's mercifulpresence, so as to find comfort by spreading his case before him. Hisviews were all gloomy. God seemed to stand at a distance, and frownupon him. Yet Job expressed his assurance that he should be broughtforth, tried, and approved, for he had obeyed the precepts of God. Hehad relished and delighted in the truths and commandments of God. Herewe should notice that Job justified himself rather than God, or inopposition to him, ch. 32:2. Job might feel that he was clear from thecharges of his friends, but boldly to assert that, though visited bythe hand of God, it was not a chastisement of sin, was his error. Andhe is guilty of a second, when he denies that there are dealings ofProvidence with men in this present life, wherein the injured findredress, and the evil are visited for their sins.
Job 23:13-17	<br>As Job does not once question but that his trials are from the hand ofGod, and that there is no such thing as chance, how does he account forthem? The principle on which he views them is, that the hope and rewardof the faithful servants of God are only laid up in another life; andhe maintains that it is plain to all, that the wicked are not treatedaccording to their deserts in this life, but often directly thereverse. But though the obtaining of mercy, the first-fruits of theSpirit of grace, pledges a God, who will certainly finish the workwhich he has began; yet the afflicted believer is not to conclude thatall prayer and entreaty will be in vain, and that he should sink intodespair, and faint when he is reproved of Him. He cannot tell but theintention of God in afflicting him may be to produce penitence andprayer in his heart. May we learn to obey and trust the Lord, even intribulation; to live or die as he pleases: we know not for what goodends our lives may be shortened or prolonged.
Job 24:1-12	<br>Job discourses further about the prosperity of the wicked. That manylive at ease who are ungodly and profane, he had showed, ch. xxi. Herehe shows that many who live in open defiance of all the laws ofjustice, succeed in wicked practices; and we do not see them reckonedwith in this world. He notices those that do wrong under pretence oflaw and authority; and robbers, those that do wrong by force. He says,"God layeth not folly to them;" that is, he does not at once send hisjudgments, nor make them examples, and so manifest their folly to allthe world. But he that gets riches, and not by right, at his end shallbe a fool, Jer 17:11.
Job 24:13-17	<br>See what care and pains wicked men take to compass their wickeddesigns; let it shame our negligence and slothfulness in doing good.See what pains those take, who make provision for the flesh to fulfilthe lusts of it: pains to compass, and then to hide that which will endin death and hell at last. Less pains would mortify and crucify theflesh, and be life and heaven at last. Shame came in with sin, andeverlasting shame is at the end of it. See the misery of sinners; theyare exposed to continual frights: yet see their folly; they are afraidof coming under the eye of men, but have no dread of God's eye, whichis always upon them: they are not afraid of doing things which they areafraid of being known to do.
Job 24:18-25	<br>Sometimes how gradual is the decay, how quiet the departure of a wickedperson, how is he honoured, and how soon are all his cruelties andoppressions forgotten! They are taken off with other men, as theharvestman gathers the ears of corn as they come to hand. There willoften appear much to resemble the wrong view of Providence Job takes inthis chapter. But we are taught by the word of inspiration, that thesenotions are formed in ignorance, from partial views. The providence ofGod, in the affairs of men, is in every thing a just and wiseprovidence. Let us apply this whenever the Lord may try us. He cannotdo wrong. The unequalled sorrows of the Son of God when on earth,unless looked at in this view, perplex the mind. But when we beholdhim, as the sinner's Surety, bearing the curse, we can explain why heshould endure that wrath which was due to sin, that Divine justicemight be satisfied, and his people saved.
Job 26:1-4	<br>Job derided Bildad's answer; his words were a mixture of peevishnessand self-preference. Bildad ought to have laid before Job theconsolations, rather than the terrors of the Almighty. Christ knows howto speak what is proper for the weary, Isa 50:4; and his ministersshould not grieve those whom God would not have made sad. We are oftendisappointed in our expectations from our friends who should comfortus; but the Comforter, the Holy Ghost, never mistakes, nor fails of hisend.
Job 26:5-14	<br>Many striking instances are here given of the wisdom and power of God,in the creation and preservation of the world. If we look about us, tothe earth and waters here below, we see his almighty power. If weconsider hell beneath, though out of our sight, yet we may conceive thediscoveries of God's power there. If we look up to heaven above, we seedisplays of God's almighty power. By his Spirit, the eternal Spiritthat moved upon the face of the waters, the breath of his mouth, Ps33:6, he has not only made the heavens, but beautified them. Byredemption, all the other wonderful works of the Lord are eclipsed; andwe may draw near, and taste his grace, learn to love him, and walk withdelight in his ways. The ground of the controversy between Job and theother disputants was, that they unjustly thought from his afflictionsthat he must have been guilty of heinous crimes. They appear not tohave duly considered the evil and just desert of original sin; nor didthey take into account the gracious designs of God in purifying hispeople. Job also darkened counsel by words without knowledge. But hisviews were more distinct. He does not appear to have alleged hispersonal righteousness as the ground of his hope towards God. Yet whathe admitted in a general view of his case, he in effect denied, whilehe complained of his sufferings as unmerited and severe; that verycomplaint proving the necessity for their being sent, in order to hisbeing further humbled in the sight of God.
Job 27:1-6	<br>Job's friends now suffered him to speak, and he proceeded in a graveand useful manner. Job had confidence in the goodness both of his causeand of his God; and cheerfully committed his cause to him. But Job hadnot due reverence when he spake of God as taking away his judgment, andvexing his soul. To resolve that our hearts shall not reproach us,while we hold fast our integrity, baffles the designs of the evilspirit.
Job 27:7-10	<br>Job looked upon the condition of a hypocrite and a wicked man, to bemost miserable. If they gained through life by their profession, andkept up their presumptuous hope till death, what would that avail whenGod required their souls? The more comfort we find in our religion, themore closely we shall cleave to it. Those who have no delight in God,are easily drawn away by the pleasures, and easily overcome by thecrosses of this life. (Job 27:11-23)
Job 27:11-23	<br>Job's friends, on the same subject, spoke of the misery of wicked menbefore death as proportioned to their crimes; Job considered that if itwere not so, still the consequences of their death would be dreadful.Job undertook to set this matter in a true light. Death to a godly man,is like a fair gale of wind to convey him to the heavenly country; but,to a wicked man, it is like a storm, that hurries him away todestruction. While he lived, he had the benefit of sparing mercy; butnow the day of God's patience is over, and he will pour out upon himhis wrath. When God casts down a man, there is no flying from, norbearing up under his anger. Those who will not now flee to the arms ofDivine grace, which are stretched out to receive them, will not be ableto flee from the arms of Divine wrath, which will shortly be stretchedout to destroy them. And what is a man profited if he gain the wholeworld, and thus lose his own soul?
Job 28:1-11	<br>Job maintained that the dispensations of Providence were regulated bythe highest wisdom. To confirm this, he showed of what a great deal ofknowledge and wealth men may make themselves masters. The caverns ofthe earth may be discovered, but not the counsels of Heaven. Go to theminers, thou sluggard in religion, consider their ways, and be wise.Let their courage and diligence in seeking the wealth that perishes,shame us out of slothfulness and faint-heartedness in labouring for thetrue riches. How much better is it to get wisdom than gold! How mucheasier, and safer! Yet gold is sought for, but grace neglected. Willthe hopes of precious things out of the earth, so men call them, thoughreally they are paltry and perishing, be such a spur to industry, andshall not the certain prospect of truly precious things in heaven bemuch more so?
Job 28:12-19	<br>Job here speaks of wisdom and understanding, the knowing and enjoyingof God and ourselves. Its worth is infinitely more than all the richesin this world. It is a gift of the Holy Ghost which cannot be boughtwith money. Let that which is most precious in God's account, be so inours. Job asks after it as one that truly desired to find it, anddespaired of finding it any where but in God; any way but by Divinerevelation. (Job 28:20-28)
Job 28:20-28	<br>There is a two-fold wisdom; one hid in God, which is secret, andbelongs not to us; the other made known by him, and revealed to man.One day's events, and one man's affairs, have such reference to, and sohang one upon another, that He only, to whom all is open, and who seesthe whole at one view, can rightly judge of every part. But theknowledge of God's revealed will is within our reach, and will do usgood. Let man look upon this as his wisdom, To fear the Lord, and todepart from evil. Let him learn that, and he is learned enough. Whereis this wisdom to be found? The treasures of it are hid in Christ,revealed by the word, received by faith, through the Holy Ghost. Itwill not feed pride or vanity, or amuse our vain curiosity. It teachesand encourages sinners to fear the Lord, and to depart from evil, inthe exercise of repentance and faith, without desiring to solve alldifficulties about the events of this life.
Job 29:1-6	<br>Job proceeds to contrast his former prosperity with his present misery,through God's withdrawing from him. A gracious soul delights in God'ssmiles, not in the smiles of this world. Four things were then verypleasant to holy Job. 1. The confidence he had in the Divineprotection. 2. The enjoyment he had of the Divine favour. 3. Thecommunion he had with the Divine word. 4. The assurance he had of theDivine presence. God's presence with a man in his house, though it bebut a cottage, makes it a castle and a palace. Then also he had comfortin his family. Riches and flourishing families, like a candle, may besoon extinguished. But when the mind is enlightened by the Holy Spirit,when a man walks in the light of God's countenance, every outwardcomfort is doubled, every trouble is diminished, and he may passcheerfully by this light through life and through death. Yet thesensible comfort of this state is often withdrawn for a season; andcommonly this arises from sinful neglect, and grieving the Holy Spirit:sometimes it may be a trial of a man's faith and grace. But it isneedful to examine ourselves, to seek for the cause of such a change byfervent prayer, and to increase our watchfulness.
Job 29:7-17	<br>All sorts of people paid respect to Job, not only for the dignity ofhis rank, but for his personal merit, his prudence, integrity, and goodmanagement. Happy the men who are blessed with such gifts as these!They have great opportunities of honouring God and doing good, but havegreat need to watch against pride. Happy the people who are blessedwith such men! it is a token for good to them. Here we see what Jobvalued himself by, in the day of his prosperity. It was by hisusefulness. He valued himself by the check he gave to the violence ofproud and evil men. Good magistrates must thus be a restraint toevil-doers, and protect the innocent; in order to this, they should armthemselves with zeal and resolution. Such men are public blessings, andresemble Him who rescues poor sinners from Satan. How many who wereready to perish, now are blessing Him! But who can show forth Hispraises? May we trust in His mercy, and seek to imitate His truth,justice, and love.
Job 29:18-25	<br>Being thus honoured and useful, Job had hoped to die in peace andhonour, in a good old age. If such an expectation arise from livelyfaith in the providence and promise of God, it is well; but if fromconceit of our own wisdom, and dependence on changeable, earthlythings, it is ill grounded, and turns to sin. Every one that has thespirit of wisdom, has not the spirit of government; but Job had both.Yet he had the tenderness of a comforter. This he thought upon withpleasure, when he was himself a mourner. Our Lord Jesus is a King whohates iniquity, and upon whom the blessing of a world ready to perishcomes. To Him let us give ear.
Job 30:1-14	<br>Job contrasts his present condition with his former honour andauthority. What little cause have men to be ambitious or proud of thatwhich may be so easily lost, and what little confidence is to be put init! We should not be cast down if we are despised, reviled, and hatedby wicked men. We should look to Jesus, who endured the contradictionof sinners.
Job 30:15-31	<br>Job complains a great deal. Harbouring hard thoughts of God was the sinwhich did, at this time, most easily beset Job. When inward temptationsjoin with outward calamities, the soul is hurried as in a tempest, andis filled with confusion. But woe be to those who really have God foran enemy! Compared with the awful state of ungodly men, what are alloutward, or even inward temporal afflictions? There is something withwhich Job comforts himself, yet it is but a little. He foresees thatdeath will be the end of all his troubles. God's wrath might bring himto death; but his soul would be safe and happy in the world of spirits.If none pity us, yet our God, who corrects, pities us, even as a fatherpitieth his own children. And let us look more to the things ofeternity: then the believer will cease from mourning, and joyfullypraise redeeming love.
Job 31:1-8	<br>Job did not speak the things here recorded by way of boasting, but inanswer to the charge of hypocrisy. He understood the spiritual natureof God's commandments, as reaching to the thoughts and intents of theheart. It is best to let our actions speak for us; but in some cases weowe it to ourselves and to the cause of God, solemnly to protest ourinnocence of the crimes of which we are falsely accused. The lusts ofthe flesh, and the love of the world, are two fatal rocks on whichmultitudes split; against these Job protests he was always careful tostand upon his guard. And God takes more exact notice of us than we doof ourselves; let us therefore walk circumspectly. He carefully avoidedall sinful means of getting wealth. He dreaded all forbidden profit asmuch as all forbidden pleasure. What we have in the world may be usedwith comfort, or lost with comfort, if honestly gotten. Without stricthonestly and faithfulness in all our dealings, we can have no goodevidence of true godliness. Yet how many professors are unable to abidethis touchstone!
Job 31:9-15	<br>All the defilements of the life come from a deceived heart. Lust is afire in the soul: those that indulge it, are said to burn. It consumesall that is good there, and lays the conscience waste. It kindles thefire of God's wrath, which, if not quenched by the blood of Christ,will consume even to eternal destruction. It consumes the body; itconsumes the substance. Burning lusts bring burning judgments. Job hada numerous household, and he managed it well. He considered that he hada Master in heaven; and as we are undone if God should be severe withus, we ought to be mild and gentle towards all with whom we have to do.
Job 31:16-23	<br>Job's conscience gave testimony concerning his just and charitablebehaviour toward the poor. He is most large upon this head, because inthis matter he was particularly accused. He was tender of all, andhurtful to none. Notice the principles by which Job was restrained frombeing uncharitable and unmerciful. He stood in awe of the Lord, ascertainly against him, if he should wrong the poor. Regard to worldlyinterests may restrain a man from actual crimes; but the grace of Godalone can make him hate, dread, and shun sinful thoughts and desires.
Job 31:24-32	<br>Job protests, 1. That he never set his heart upon the wealth of thisworld. How few prosperous professors can appeal to the Lord, that theyhave not rejoiced because their gains were great! Through thedetermination to be rich, numbers ruin their souls, or piercethemselves with many sorrows. 2. He never was guilty of idolatry. Thesource of idolatry is in the heart, and it corrupts men, and provokesGod to send judgments upon a nation. 3. He neither desired nordelighted in the hurt of the worst enemy he had. If others bear maliceto us, that will not justify us in bearing malice to them. 4. He hadnever been unkind to strangers. Hospitality is a Christian duty, 1Pe4:9.
Job 31:33-40	<br>Job clears himself from the charge of hypocrisy. We are loth to confessour faults, willing to excuse them, and to lay the blame upon others.But he that thus covers his sins, shall not prosper, Pr 28:13. Hespeaks of his courage in what is good, as an evidence of his sincerityin it. When men get estates unjustly, they are justly deprived ofcomfort from them; it was sown wheat, but shall come up thistles. Whatmen do not come honestly by, will never do them any good. The words ofJob are ended. They end with a bold assertion, that, with respect toaccusation against his moral and religious character as the cause forhis sufferings, he could appeal to God. But, however confident Job was,we shall see he was mistaken, chap. 40:4,5; 1Jo 1:8. Let us all judgeourselves; wherein we are guilty, let us seek forgiveness in that bloodwhich cleanseth from all sin; and may the Lord have mercy upon us, andwrite his laws in our hearts!
Job 32:1-5	<br>Job's friends were silenced, but not convinced. Others had beenpresent. Elihu was justly displeased with Job, as more anxious to clearhis own character than the justice and goodness of God. Elihu wasdispleased with Job's friends because they had not been candid to Job.Seldom is a quarrel begun, more seldom is a quarrel carried on, inwhich there are not faults on both sides. Those that seek for truth,must not reject what is true and good on either side, nor approve ordefend what is wrong.
Job 32:6-14	<br>Elihu professes to speak by the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, andcorrects both parties. He allowed that those who had the longestexperience should speak first. But God gives wisdom as he pleases; thisencouraged him to state his opinion. By attention to the word of God,and dependence upon the Holy Spirit, young men may become wiser thanthe aged; but this wisdom will render them swift to hear, slow tospeak, and disposed to give others a patient hearing.
Job 32:15-22	<br>If we are sure that the Spirit of God suggested what we are about tosay, still we ought to refrain, till it comes to our turn to speak. Godis the God of order, not of confusion. It is great refreshment to agood man, to speak for the glory of the Lord, and to edify others. Andthe more we consider the majesty of God, as our Maker, and the more wedread his wrath and justice, the less shall we sinfully fear or flattermen. Could we set the wrath Lord always before us, in his mercies andhis terrors, we should not be moved from doing our duty in whatever weare called to do.
Job 33:1-7	<br>Job had desired a judge to decide his appeal. Elihu was one accordingto his wish, a man like himself. If we would rightly convince men, itmust be by reason, not by terror; by fair argument, not by a heavyhand.
Job 33:8-13	<br>Elihu charges Job with reflecting upon the justice and goodness of God.When we hear any thing said to God's dishonour, we ought to bear ourtestimony against it. Job had represented God as severe in marking whathe did amiss. Elihu urges that he had spoken wrong, and that he oughtto humble himself before God, and by repentance to unsay it. God is notaccountable to us. It is unreasonable for weak, sinful creatures, tostrive with a God of infinite wisdom, power, and goodness. He acts withperfect justice, wisdom, and goodness, where we cannot perceive it.
Job 33:14-18	<br>God speaks to us by conscience, by providences, and by ministers; ofall these Elihu discourses. There was not then, that we know of, anyDivine revelation in writing, though now it is our principal guide.When God designs men's good, by the convictions and dictates of theirown consciences, he opens the heart, as Lydia's, and opens the ears, sothat conviction finds or forces its way in. The end and design of theseadmonitions are to keep men from sin, particularly the sin of pride.While sinners are pursuing evil purposes, and indulging their pride,their souls are hastening to destruction. That which turns men fromsin, saves them from hell. What a mercy it is to be under therestraints of an awakened conscience!
Job 33:19-28	<br>Job complained of his diseases, and judged by them that God was angrywith him; his friends did so too: but Elihu shows that God oftenafflicts the body for good to the soul. This thought will be of greatuse for our getting good from sickness, in and by which God speaks tomen. Pain is the fruit of sin; yet, by the grace of God, the pain ofthe body is often made a means of good to the soul. When afflictionshave done their work, they shall be removed. A ransom or propitiationis found. Jesus Christ is the Messenger and the Ransom, so Elihu callshim, as Job had called him his Redeemer, for he is both the Purchaserand the Price, the Priest and the sacrifice. So high was the value ofsouls, that nothing less would redeem them; and so great the hurt doneby sin, that nothing less would atone for it, than the blood of the Sonof God, who gave his life a ransom for many. A blessed change follows.Recovery from sickness is a mercy indeed, when it proceeds from theremission of sin. All that truly repent of their sins, shall find mercywith God. The works of darkness are unfruitful works; all the gains ofsin will come far short of the damage. We must, with a broken andcontrite heart, confess our sins to God, 1Jo 1:9. We must confess thefact of sin; and not try to justify or excuse ourselves. We mustconfess the fault of sin; I have perverted that which was right. Wemust confess the folly of sin; So foolish have I been and ignorant. Isthere not good reason why we should make such a confession?
Job 33:29-33	<br>Elihu shows that God's great and gracious design toward the children ofmen, is, to save them from being for ever miserable, and to bring themto be for ever happy. By whatever means we are kept back from the weshall bless the Lord for them at least, and should bless him for themthough they be painful and distressing. Those that perish for ever arewithout excuse, for they would not be healed.
Job 34:1-9	<br>Elihu calls upon those present to decide with him upon Job's words. Theplainest Christian, whose mind is enlightened, whose heart issanctified by the Spirit of God, and who is versed in the Scriptures,can say how far matters, words, or actions, agree with true religion,better than any that lean to their own understandings. Job had spokenas if he meant wholly to justify himself. He that say, I have cleansedmy hands in vain, does not only offend against God's children, Ps73:13-15, but gratifies his enemies, and says as they say.
Job 34:10-15	<br>Elihu had showed Job, that God meant him no hurt by afflicting him, butintended his spiritual benefit. Here he shows, that God did him nowrong by afflicting him. If the former did not satisfy him, this oughtto silence him. God cannot do wickedness, nor the Almighty commitwrong. If services now go unrewarded, and sins now go unpunished, yetthere is a day coming, when God will fully render to every manaccording to his works. Further, though the believer's finalcondemnation is done away through the Saviour's ransom, yet he hasmerited worse than any outward afflictions; so that no wrong is done tohim, however he may be tried.
Job 34:16-30	<br>Elihu appeals directly to Job himself. Could he suppose that God waslike those earthly princes, who hate right, who are unfit to rule, andprove the scourges of mankind? It is daring presumption to condemnGod's proceedings, as Job had done by his discontents. Elihu suggestsdivers considerations to Job, to produce in him high thoughts of God,and so to persuade him to submit. Job had often wished to plead hiscause before God. Elihu asks, To what purpose? All is well that Goddoes, and will be found so. What can make those uneasy, whose soulsdwell at ease in God? The smiles of all the world cannot quiet those onwhom God frowns.
Job 34:31-37	<br>When we reprove for what is amiss, we must direct to what is good.Job's friends would have had him own himself a wicked man. Let willonly oblige him to own that he spoke unadvisedly with his lips. Let us,in giving reproof, not make a matter worse than it is. Elihu directsJob to humble himself before God for his sins, and to accept thepunishment. Also to pray to God to discover his sins to him. A good manis willing to know the worst of himself; particularly, underaffliction, he desires to be told wherefore God contends with him. Itis not enough to be sorry for our sins, but we must go and sin no more.And if we are affectionate children, we shall love to speak with ourFather, and to tell him all our mind. Elihu reasons with Job concerninghis discontent under affliction. We are ready to think every thing thatconcerns us should be just as we would have it; but it is notreasonable to expect this. Elihu asks whether there was not sin andfolly in what Job said. God is righteous in all his ways, and holy inall his works, Ps 145:17. The believer saith, Let my Saviour, my wiseand loving Lord, choose every thing for me. I am sure that will bewisest, and the best for his glory and my good.
Job 35:1-8	<br>Elihu reproves Job for justifying himself more than God, and called hisattention to the heavens. They are far above us, and God is far abovethem; how much then is he out of the reach, either of our sins or ofour services! We have no reason to complain if we have not what weexpect, but should be thankful that we have better than we deserve.
Job 35:9-13	<br>Job complained that God did not regard the cries of the oppressedagainst their oppressors. This he knew not how to reconcile the justiceof God and his government. Elihu solves the difficulty. Men do notnotice the mercies they enjoy in and under their afflictions, nor arethankful for them, therefore they cannot expect that God should deliverthem out of affliction. He gives songs in the night; when our conditionis dark and melancholy, there is that in God's providence and promise,which is sufficient to support us, and to enable us even to rejoice intribulation. When we only pore upon our afflictions, and neglect theconsolations of God which are treasured up for us, it is just in God toreject our prayers. Even the things that will kill the body, cannothurt the soul. If we cry to God for the removal of an affliction, andit is not removed, the reason is, not because the Lord's hand isshortened, or his ear heavy; but because we are not sufficientlyhumbled.
Job 35:14-16	<br>As in prosperity we are ready to think our mountain will never bebrought low; so when in adversity, we are ready to think our valleywill never be filled up. But to conclude that to-morrow must be as thisday, is as absurd as to think that the weather, when either fair orfoul, will be always so. When Job looked up to God, he had no reason tospeak despairingly. There is a day of judgment, when all that seemsamiss will be found to be right, and all that seems dark and difficultwill be cleared up and set straight. And if there is Divine wrath inour troubles, it is because we quarrel with God, are fretful, anddistrust Divine Providence. This was Job's case. Elihu was directed byGod to humble Job, for as to some things he had both opened his mouthin vain, and had multiplied words without knowledge. Let us beadmonished, in our afflictions, not so much to set forth the greatnessof our suffering, as the greatness of the mercy of God.
Job 36:1-4	<br>Elihu only maintained that the affliction was sent for his trial; andlengthened because Job was not yet thoroughly humbled under it. Hesought to ascribe righteousness to his Maker; to clear this truth, thatGod is righteous in all his ways. Such knowledge must be learned fromthe word and Spirit of God, for naturally we are estranged from it. Thefitness of Elihu's discourse to the dispute between Job and his friendsis plain. It pointed out to Job the true reason of those trials withwhich he had been pointed out to Job the true reason of those trialswith which he had been visited. It taught that God had acted in mercytowards him, and the spiritual benefit he was to derive from them. Itcorrected the mistake of his friends, and showed that Job's calamitieswere for good.
Job 36:5-14	<br>Elihu here shows that God acts as righteous Governor. He is alwaysready to defend those that are injured. If our eye is ever toward Godin duty, his eye will be ever upon us in mercy, and, when we are at thelowest, will not overlook us. God intends, when he afflicts us, todiscover past sins to us, and to bring them to our remembrance. Also,to dispose our hearts to be taught: affliction makes people willing tolearn, through the grace of God working with and by it. And further, todeter us from sinning for the future. It is a command, to have no moreto do with sin. If we faithfully serve God, we have the promise of thelife that now is, and the comforts of it, as far as is for God's gloryand our good: and who would desire them any further? We have thepossession of inward pleasures, the great peace which those have thatlove God's law. If the affliction fail in its work, let men expect thefurnace to be heated till they are consumed. Those that die withoutknowledge, die without grace, and are undone for ever. See the natureof hypocrisy; it lies in the heart: that is for the world and theflesh, while perhaps the outside seems to be for God and religion.Whether sinners die in youth, or live long to heap up wrath, their caseis dreadful. The souls of the wicked live after death, but it is ineverlasting misery.
Job 36:15-23	<br>Elihu shows that Job caused the continuance of his own trouble. Hecautions him not to persist in frowardness. Even good men need to bekept to their duty by the fear of God's wrath; the wisest and best haveenough in them to deserve his stroke. Let not Job continue his unjustquarrel with God and his providence. And let us never dare to thinkfavourably of sin, never indulge it, nor allow ourselves in it. Elihuthinks Job needed this caution, he having chosen rather to gratify hispride and humour by contending with God, than to mortify them bysubmitting, and accepting the punishment. It is absurd for us to thinkto teach Him who is himself the Fountain of light, truth, knowledge,and instruction. He teaches by the Bible, and that is the best book;teaches by his Son, and he is the best Master. He is just in allproceedings.
Job 36:24-33	<br>Elihu endeavours to fill Job with high thought of God, and so topersuade him into cheerful submission to his providence. Man may seeGod's works, and is capable of discerning his hand in them, which thebeasts are not, therefore they ought to give him the glory. But whilethe worker of iniquity ought to tremble, the true believer shouldrejoice. Children should hear with pleasure their Father's voice, evenwhen he speaks in terror to his enemies. There is no light but theremay be a cloud to intercept it. The light of the favour of God, thelight of his countenance, the most blessed light of all, even thatlight has many a cloud. The clouds of our sins cause the Lord to hisface, and hinder the light of his loving-kindness from shining on oursouls.
Job 37:1-13	<br>The changes of the weather are the subject of a great deal of ourthoughts and common talk; but how seldom do we think and speak of thesethings, as Elihu, with a regard to God, the director of them! We mustnotice the glory of God, not only in the thunder and lightning, but inthe more common and less awful changes of the weather; as the snow andrain. Nature directs all creatures to shelter themselves from a storm;and shall man only be unprovided with a refuge? Oh that men wouldlisten to the voice of God, who in many ways warns them to flee fromthe wrath to come; and invites them to accept his salvation, and to behappy. The ill opinion which men entertain of the Divine direction,peculiarly appears in their murmurs about the weather, though the wholeresult of the year proves the folly of their complaints. Believersshould avoid this; no days are bad as God makes them, though we makemany bad by our sins. (Job 37:14-20)
Job 37:14-20	<br>Due thoughts of the works of God will help to reconcile us to all hisprovidences. As God has a powerful, freezing north wind, so he has athawing, composing south wind: the Spirit is compared to both, becausehe both convinces and comforts, So 4:16. The best of men are much inthe dark concerning the glorious perfections of the Divine nature andthe Divine government. Those who, through grace, know much of God, knownothing, in comparison with what is to be known, and of what will beknown, when that which is perfect is come.
Job 37:21-24	<br>Elihu concludes his discourse with some great sayings concerning theglory of God. Light always is, but is not always to be seen. Whenclouds come between, the sun is darkened in the clear day. The light ofGod's favour shines ever towards his faithful servants, though it benot always seen. Sins are clouds, and often hinder us from seeing thatbright light which is in the face of God. Also, as to those thickclouds of sorrow which often darken our minds, the Lord hath a windwhich passes and clears them away. What is that wind? It is his HolySpirit. As the wind dispels and sweeps away the clouds which aregathered in the air, so the Spirit of God clears our souls from theclouds and fogs of ignorance and unbelief, of sin and lust. From allthese clouds the Holy Spirit of God frees us in the work ofregeneration. And from all the clouds which trouble our consciences,the Holy Spirit sets us free in the work of consolation. Now that Godis about to speak, Elihu delivers a few words, as the sum of all hisdiscourse. With God is terrible majesty. Sooner or later all men shallfear him.
Job 38:1-3	<br>Job had silenced, but had not convinced his friends. Elihu had silencedJob, but had not brought him to admit his guilt before God. It pleasedthe Lord to interpose. The Lord, in this discourse, humbles Job, andbrings him to repent of his passionate expressions concerning God'sprovidential dealings with him; and this he does, by calling upon Jobto compare God's being from everlasting to everlasting, with his owntime; God's knowledge of all things, with his own ignorance; and God'salmighty power, with his own weakness. Our darkening the counsels ofGod's wisdom with our folly, is a great provocation to God. Humblefaith and sincere obedience see farthest and best into the will of theLord.
Job 38:4-11	<br>For the humbling of Job, God here shows him his ignorance, evenconcerning the earth and the sea. As we cannot find fault with God'swork, so we need not fear concerning it. The works of his providence,as well as the work of creation, never can be broken; and the work ofredemption is no less firm, of which Christ himself is both theFoundation and the Corner-stone. The church stands as firm as theearth.
Job 38:12-24	<br>The Lord questions Job, to convince him of his ignorance, and shame himfor his folly in prescribing to God. If we thus try ourselves, we shallsoon be brought to own that what we know is nothing in comparison withwhat we know not. By the tender mercy of our God, the Day-spring fromon high has visited us, to give light to those that sit in darkness,whose hearts are turned to it as clay to the seal, 2Co 4:6. God's wayin the government of the world is said to be in the sea; this means,that it is hid from us. Let us make sure that the gates of heaven shallbe opened to us on the other side of death, and then we need not fearthe opening of the gates of death. It is presumptuous for us, whoperceive not the breadth of the earth, to dive into the depth of God'scounsels. We should neither in the brightest noon count upon perpetualday, nor in the darkest midnight despair of the return of the morning;and this applies to our inward as well as to our outward condition.What folly it is to strive against God! How much is it our interest toseek peace with him, and to keep in his love!
Job 38:25-41	<br>Hitherto God had put questions to Job to show him his ignorance; nowGod shows his weakness. As it is but little that he knows, he ought notto arraign the Divine counsels; it is but little he can do, thereforehe ought not to oppose the ways of Providence. See the all-sufficiencyof the Divine Providence; it has wherewithal to satisfy the desire ofevery living thing. And he that takes care of the young ravens,certainly will not be wanting to his people. This being but oneinstance of the Divine compassion out of many, gives us occasion tothink how much good our God does, every day, beyond what we are awareof. Every view we take of his infinite perfections, should remind us ofhis right to our love, the evil of sinning against him, and our need ofhis mercy and salvation.
Job 40:1-5	<br>Communion with the Lord effectually convinces and humbles a saint, andmakes him glad to part with his most beloved sins. There is need to bethoroughly convinced and humbled, to prepare us for remarkabledeliverances. After God had shown Job, by his manifest ignorance of theworks of nature, how unable he was to judge of the methods and designsof Providence, he puts a convincing question to him; Shall he thatcontendeth with the Almighty instruct him? Now Job began to melt intogodly sorrow: when his friends reasoned with him, he did not yield; butthe voice of the Lord is powerful. When the Spirit of truth is come, heshall convince. Job yields himself to the grace of God. He owns himselfan offender, and has nothing to say to justify himself. He is nowsensible that he has sinned; and therefore he calls himself vile.Repentance changes men's opinion of themselves. Job is now convinced ofhis error. Those who are truly sensible of their own sinfulness andvileness, dare not justify themselves before God. He perceived that hewas a poor, mean, foolish, and sinful creature, who ought not to haveuttered one word against the Divine conduct. One glimpse of God's holynature would appal the stoutest rebel. How, then will the wicked bearthe sight of his glory at the day of judgment? But when we see thisglory revealed in Jesus Christ, we shall be humbled without beingterrified; self-abasement agrees with filial love. (Job 40:6-14)
Job 40:6-14	<br>Those who profit by what they have heard from God, shall hear more fromhim. And those who are truly convinced of sin, yet need to be morethoroughly convinced and more humbled. No doubt God, and he only, haspower to humble and bring down proud men; he has wisdom to know whenand how to do it, and it is not for us to teach him how to govern theworld. Our own hands cannot save us by recommending us to God's grace,much less rescuing us from his justice; and therefore into his hand wemust commit ourselves. The renewal of a believer proceeds in the sameway of conviction, humbling, and watchfulness against remaining sin, ashis first conversion. When convinced of many evils in our conduct, westill need convincing of many more.
Job 40:15-24	<br>God, for the further proving of his own power, describes two vastanimals, far exceeding man in bulk and strength. Behemoth signifiesbeasts. Most understand it of an animal well known in Egypt, called theriver-horse, or hippopotamus. This vast animal is noticed as anargument to humble ourselves before the great God; for he created thisvast animal, which is so fearfully and wonderfully made. Whateverstrength this or any other creature has, it is derived from God. Hethat made the soul of man, knows all the ways to it, and can make thesword of justice, his wrath, to approach and touch it. Every godly manhas spiritual weapons, the whole armour of God, to resist, yea, toovercome the tempter, that his never-dying soul may be safe, whateverbecomes of his frail flesh and mortal body.
Job 42:1-6	<br>Job was now sensible of his guilt; he would no longer speak in his ownexcuse; he abhorred himself as a sinner in heart and life, especiallyfor murmuring against God, and took shame to himself. When theunderstanding is enlightened by the Spirit of grace, our knowledge ofDivine things as far exceeds what we had before, as the sight of theeyes excels report and common fame. By the teachings of men, Godreveals his Son to us; but by the teachings of his Spirit he revealshis Son in us, Ga 1:16, and changes us into the same image, 2Co 3:18.It concerns us to be deeply humbled for the sins of which we areconvinced. Self-loathing is ever the companion of true repentance. TheLord will bring those whom he loveth, to adore him in self-abasement;while true grace will always lead them to confess their sins withoutself-justifying.
Job 42:7-9	<br>After the Lord had convinced and humbled Job, and brought him torepentance, he owned him, comforted him, and put honour upon him. Thedevil had undertaken to prove Job a hypocrite, and his three friendshad condemned him as a wicked man; but if God say, Well done, thou goodand faithful servant, it is of little consequence who says otherwise.Job's friends had wronged God, by making prosperity a mark of the truechurch, and affliction a certain proof of God's wrath. Job had referredthings to the future judgment and the future state, more than hisfriends, therefore he spake of God that which was right, better thanhis friends had done. And as Job prayed and offered sacrifice for thosethat had grieved and wounded his spirit, so Christ prayed for hispersecutors, and ever lives, making intercession for the transgressors.Job's friends were good men, and belonged to God, and He would not letthem be in their mistake any more than Job; but having humbled him by adiscourse out of the whirlwind, he takes another way to humble them.They are not to argue the matter again, but they must agree in asacrifice and a prayer, and that must reconcile them, Those who differin judgment about lesser things, yet are one in Christ the greatSacrifice, and ought therefore to love and bear with one another. WhenGod was angry with Job's friends, he put them in a way to make peacewith him. Our quarrels with God always begin on our part, but themaking peace begins on his. Peace with God is to be had only in his ownway, and upon his own terms. These will never seem hard to those whoknow how to value this blessing: they will be glad of it, like Job'sfriends, upon any terms, though ever so humbling. Job did not insultover his friends, but God being graciously reconciled to him, he waseasily reconciled to them. In all our prayers and services we shouldaim to be accepted of the Lord; not to have praise of men, but toplease God. (Job 42:10-17)
Job 42:10-17	<br>In the beginning of this book we had Job's patience under his troubles,for an example; here, for our encouragement to follow that example, wehave his happy end. His troubles began in Satan's malice, which Godrestrained; his restoration began in God's mercy, which Satan could notoppose. Mercy did not return when Job was disputing with his friends,but when he was praying for them. God is served and pleased with ourwarm devotions, not with our warm disputes. God doubled Job'spossessions. We may lose much for the Lord, but we shall not lose anything by him. Whether the Lord gives us health and temporal blessingsor not, if we patiently suffer according to his will, in the end weshall be happy. Job's estate increased. The blessing of the Lord makesrich; it is he that gives us power to get wealth, and gives success inhonest endeavours. The last days of a good man sometimes prove hisbest, his last works his best works, his last comforts his bestcomforts; for his path, like that of the morning light, shines more andmore unto the perfect day.
Psa 1:1-3	<br>To meditate in God's word, is to discourse with ourselves concerningthe great things contained in it, with close application of mind andfixedness of thought. We must have constant regard to the word of God,as the rule of our actions, and the spring of our comforts; and have itin our thoughts night and day. For this purpose no time is amiss.
Psa 1:4-6	<br>The ungodly are the reverse of the righteous, both in character andcondition. The ungodly are not so, ver. 4; they are led by the counselof the wicked, in the way of sinners, to the seat of the scornful; theyhave no delight in the law of God; they bring forth no fruit but whatis evil. The righteous are like useful, fruitful trees: the ungodly arelike the chaff which the wind drives away: the dust which the owner ofthe floor desires to have driven away, as not being of any use. Theyare of no worth in God's account, how highly soever they may valuethemselves. They are easily driven to and fro by every wind oftemptation. The chaff may be, for a while, among the wheat, but He iscoming, whose fan is in his hand, and who will thoroughly purge hisfloor. Those that, by their own sin and folly, make themselves aschaff, will be found so before the whirlwind and fire of Divine wrath.The doom of the ungodly is fixed, but whenever the sinner becomessensible of this guilt and misery, he may be admitted into the companyof the righteous by Christ the living way, and become in Christ a newcreature. He has new desires, new pleasures, hopes, fears, sorrows,companions, and employments. His thoughts, words, and actions arechanged. He enters on a new state, and bears a new character. Behold,all things are become new by Divine grace, which changes his soul intothe image of the Redeemer. How different the character and end of theungodly!
Psa 2:1-6	<br>We are here told who would appear as adversaries to Christ. As thisworld is the kingdom of Satan, unconverted men, of every rank, party,and character, are stirred up by him to oppose the cause of God. Butthe rulers of the earth generally have been most active. The truths andprecepts of Christianity are against ambitious projects and worldlylusts. We are told what they aim at in this opposition. They wouldbreak asunder the bands of conscience, and the cords of God'scommandments; they will not receive, but cast them away as far as theycan. These enemies can show no good cause for opposing so just and holya government, which, if received by all, would bring a heaven uponearth. They can hope for no success in so opposing so powerful akingdom. The Lord Jesus has all power both in heaven and in earth, andis Head over all things to the church, notwithstanding the restlessendeavours of his enemies. Christ's throne is set up in his church,that is, in the hearts of all believers.
Psa 2:7-9	<br>The kingdom of the Messiah is founded upon an eternal decree of God theFather. This our Lord Jesus often referred to, as what he governedhimself by. God hath said unto him, Thou art my Son, and it becomeseach of us to say to him, Thou art my Lord, my Sovereign'. The Son, inasking the heathen for his inheritance, desires their happiness in him;so that he pleads for them, ever lives to do so, and is able to save tothe uttermost, and he shall have multitudes of willing, loyal subjects,among them. Christians are the possession of the Lord Jesus; they areto him for a name and a praise. God the Father gives them to him, when,by his Spirit and grace, he works upon them to submit to the LordJesus.
Psa 2:10-12	<br>Whatever we rejoice in, in this world, it must always be withtrembling, because of the uncertainty of all things in it. To welcomeJesus Christ, and to submit to him, is our wisdom and interest. Let himbe very dear and precious; love him above all, love him in sincerity,love him much, as she did, to whom much was forgiven, and, in token ofit, kissed his feet, Lu 7:38. And with a kiss of loyalty take this yokeupon you, and give up yourselves to be governed by his laws, disposedof by his providence, and entirely devoted to his cause. Unbelief is asin against the remedy. It will be utter destruction to yourselves;lest ye perish in the way of your sins, and from the way of your vainhopes; lest your way perish, lest you prove to have missed the way ofhappiness. Christ is the way; take heed lest ye be cut off from Him asyour way to God. They thought themselves in the way; but neglectingChrist, they perish from it. Blessed will those be in the day of wrath,who, by trusting in Christ, have made him their Refuge.
Psa 3:1-3	<br>An active believer, the more he is beaten off from God, either by therebukes of providence, or the reproaches of enemies, the faster hold hewill take, and the closer will he cleave to him. A child of Godstartles at the very thought of despairing of help in God. See what Godis to his people, what he will be, what they have found him, what Davidfound in him. 1. Safety; a shield for me; which denotes the advantageof that protection. 2. Honour; those whom God owns for his, have truehonour put upon them. 3. Joy and deliverance. If, in the worst oftimes, God's people can lift up their heads with joy, knowing that allshall work for good to them, they will own God as giving them bothcause and hearts to rejoice.
Psa 3:4-8	<br>Care and grief do us good, when they engage us to pray to God, as inearnest. David had always found God ready to answer his prayers.Nothing can fix a gulf between the communications of God's gracetowards us, and the working of his grace in us; between his favour andour faith. He had always been very safe under the Divine protection.This is applicable to the common mercies of every night, for which weought to give thanks every morning. Many lie down, and cannot sleep,through pain of body, or anguish of mind, or the continual alarms offear in the night. But it seems here rather to be meant of the calmnessof David's spirit, in the midst of his dangers. The Lord, by his graceand the consolations of his Spirit, made him easy. It is a great mercy,when we are in trouble, to have our minds stayed upon God. Behold theSon of David composing himself to his rest upon the cross, that bed ofsorrows; commending his Spirit into the Father's hands in fullconfidence of a joyful resurrection. Behold this, O Christian: letfaith teach thee how to sleep, and how to die; while it assures theethat as sleep is a short death, so death is only a longer sleep; thesame God watches over thee, in thy bed and in thy grave. David's faithbecame triumphant. He began the psalm with complaints of the strengthand malice of his enemies; but concludes with rejoicing in the powerand grace of his God, and now sees more with him than against him.Salvation belongeth unto the Lord; he has power to save, be the dangerever so great. All that have the Lord for their God, are sure ofsalvation; for he who is their God, is the God of Salvation.
Psa 4:1-5	<br>Hear me for thy mercy-sake, is our best plea. He who will not ask suchblessings as pardon, and justifying righteousness, and eternal life,must perish for the want of them. Alas! that so many should make sofearful a choice. The psalmist warns against sin. Keep up holyreverence of the glory and majesty of God. You have a great deal to sayto your hearts, they may be spoken with, let it not be unsaid. Examinethem by serious self-reflection; let your thoughts fasten upon thatwhich is good, and keep close to it. Consider your ways, and before youturn to sleep at night, examine your consciences with respect to whatyou have done in the day; particularly what you have done amiss, thatyou may repent of it. when you awake in the night, meditate upon God,and the things that belong to your peace. Upon a sick-bed,particularly, we should consider our ways. Be still. when you haveasked conscience a question, be serious, be silent, wait for an answer.Open not the mouth to excuse sin. All confidence must be pan answer.Open not the mouth to excuse sin. All confidence only: therefore, aftercommanding the sacrifices of righteousness, the psalmist says, Put yourtrust in the Lord.
Psa 4:6-8	<br>Wordly people inquire for good, not for the chief good; all they wantis outward good, present good, partial good, good meat, good drink, agood trade, and a good estate; but what are all these worth? Any goodwill serve the turn of most men, but a gracious soul will not be putoff so. Lord, let us have thy favour, and let us know that we have it,we desire no more; let us be satisfied of thy loving-kindness, and willbe satisfied with it. Many inquire after happiness, but David had foundit. When God puts grace in the heart, he puts gladness in the heart.Thus comforted, he pitied, but neither envied nor feared the mostprosperous sinner. He commits all his affairs to God, and is preparedto welcome his holy will. But salvation is in Christ alone; where willthose appear who despise him as their Mediator, and revile him in hisdisciples? May they stand in awe, and no longer sin against the onlyremedy.
Psa 5:1-6	<br>God is a prayer-hearing God. Such he has always been, and he is stillas ready to hear prayer as ever. The most encouraging principle ofprayer, and the most powerful plea in prayer, is, to look upon him asour King and our God. David also prays to a sin-hating God. sin isfolly, and sinners are the greatest of all fools; fools of their ownmaking. Wicked people hate God; justly are they hated of him, and thiswill be their endless misery and ruin. Let us learn the importance oftruth and sincerity, in all the affairs of life. Liars and murderersresemble the devil, and are his children, therefore it may well beexpected that God should abhor them. These were the characters ofDavid's enemies; and such as these are still the enemies of Christ andhis people.
Psa 5:7-12	<br>David prayed often alone, yet was very constant in attendance on publicworship. The mercy of God should ever be the foundation both of ourhope and of our joy, in every thing wherein we have to do with him. Letus learn to pray, not for ourselves only, but for others; grace be withall that love Christ in sincerity. The Divine blessing comes down uponus through Jesus Christ, the righteous or just One, as of old it didupon Israel through David, whom God protected, and placed upon thethrone. Thou, O Christ, art the righteous Saviour, thou art the King ofIsrael, thou art the Fountain of blessing to all believers; thy favouris the defence and protection of thy church.
Psa 6:1-7	<br>These verses speak the language of a heart truly humbled, of a brokenand contrite spirit under great afflictions, sent to awaken conscienceand mortify corruption. Sickness brought sin to his remembrance, and helooked upon it as a token of God's displeasure against him. Theaffliction of his body will be tolerable, if he has comfort in hissoul. Christ's sorest complaint, in his sufferings, was of the troubleof his soul, and the want of his Father's smiles. Every page ofScripture proclaims the fact, that salvation is only of the Lord. Manis a sinner, his case can only be reached by mercy; and never is mercymore illustrious than in restoring backsliders. With good reason we maypray, that if it be the will of God, and he has any further work for usor our friends to do in this world, he will yet spare us or them toserve him. To depart and be with Christ is happiest for the saints; butfor them to abide in the flesh is more profitable for the church.
Psa 6:8-10	<br>What a sudden change is here! Having made his request known to God, thepsalmist is confident that his sorrow will be turned into joy. By theworkings of God's grace upon his heart, he knew his prayer wasaccepted, and did not doubt but it would, in due time, be answered. Hisprayers will be accepted, coming up out of the hands of Christ theMediator. The word signifies prayer made to God, the righteous Judge,as the God of his righteousness, who would plead his cause, and righthis wrongs. A believer, through the blood and righteousness of Christ,can go to God as a righteous God, and plead with him for pardon andcleansing, who is just and faithful to grant both. He prays for theconversion of his enemies, or foretells their ruin.
Psa 7:1-9	<br>David flees to God for succour. But Christ alone could call on Heavento attest his uprightness in all things. All His works were wrought inrighteousness; and the prince of this world found nothing whereofjustly to accuse him. Yet for our sakes, submitting to be charged asguilty, he suffered all evils, but, being innocent, he triumphed overthem all. The plea is, "For the righteous God trieth the hearts and thereins." He knows the secret wickedness of the wicked, and how to bringit to an end; he is witness to the secret sincerity of the just, andhas ways of establishing it. When a man has made peace with God aboutall his sins, upon the terms of grace and mercy, through the sacrificeof the Mediator, he may, in comparison with his enemies, appeal toGod's justice to decide.
Psa 7:10-17	<br>David is confident that he shall find God his powerful Saviour. Thedestruction of sinners may be prevented by their conversion; for it isthreatened, If he turn not from his evil way, let him expect it will behis ruin. But amidst the threatenings of wrath, we have a graciousoffer of mercy. God gives sinners warning of their danger, and space torepent, and prevent it. He is slow to punish, and long-suffering tous-ward, not willing that any should perish. The sinner is described,
Psa 7:14-16), as taking more pains to ruin his soul than, if directedaright, would save it. This is true, in a sense, of all sinners. Let uslook to the Saviour under all our trials. Blessed Lord, give us graceto look to thee in the path of tribulation, going before thy church andpeople, and marking the way by thine own spotless example. Under allthe persecutions which in our lesser trials mark our way, let thelooking to Jesus animate our minds and comfort our hearts.	
Psa 8:1,2	<br>The psalmist seeks to give unto God the glory due to his name. Howbright this glory shines even in this lower world! He is ours, for hemade us, protects us, and takes special care of us. The birth, life,preaching, miracles, suffering, death, resurrection, and ascension ofJesus are known through the world. No name is so universal, no powerand influence so generally felt, as those of the Saviour of mankind.But how much brighter it shines in the upper world! We, on this earth,only hear God's excellent name, and praise that; the angels and blessedspirits above, see his glory, and praise that; yet he is exalted farabove even their blessing and praise. Sometimes the grace of Godappears wonderfully in young children. Sometimes the power of Godbrings to pass great things in his church, by very weak and unlikelyinstruments, that the excellency of the power might the more evidentlyappear to be of God, and not of man. This he does, because of hisenemies, that he may put them to silence.
Psa 8:3-9	<br>We are to consider the heavens, that man thus may be directed to sethis affections on things above. What is man, so mean a creature, thathe should be thus honoured! so sinful a creature, that he should bethus favoured! Man has sovereign dominion over the inferior creatures,under God, and is appointed their lord. This refers to Christ. In Heb2:6-8, the apostle, to prove the sovereign dominion of Christ, shows heis that Man, that Son of man, here spoken of, whom God has made to havedominion over the works of his hands. The greatest favour ever showedto the human race, and the greatest honour ever put upon human nature,were exemplified in the Lord Jesus. With good reason does the psalmistconclude as he began, Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the earth,which has been honoured with the presence of the Redeemer, and is stillenlightened by his gospel, and governed by his wisdom and power! Whatwords can reach his praises, who has a right to our obedience as ourRedeemer?
Psa 9:1-10	<br>If we would praise God acceptably, we must praise him in sincerity,with our whole heart. When we give thanks for some one particularmercy, we should remember former mercies. Our joy must not be in thegift, so much as in the Giver. The triumphs of the Redeemer ought to bethe triumphs of the redeemed. The almighty power of God is that whichthe strongest and stoutest of his enemies are no way able to standbefore. We are sure that the judgment of God is according to truth, andthat with him there is no unrighteousness. His people may, by faith,flee to him as their Refuge, and may depend on his power and promisefor their safety, so that no real hurt shall be done to them. Those whoknow him to be a God of truth and faithfulness, will rejoice in hisword of promise, and rest upon that. Those who know him to be aneverlasting Father, will trust him with their souls as their main care,and trust in him at all times, even to the end; and by constant careseek to approve themselves to him in the whole course of their lives.Who is there that would not seek him, who never hath forsaken thosethat seek Him?
Psa 9:11-20	<br>Those who believe that God is greatly to be praised, not only desire topraise him better themselves, but desire that others may join withthem. There is a day coming, when it will appear that he has notforgotten the cry of the humble; neither the cry of their blood, or thecry of their prayers. We are never brought so low, so near to death,but God can raise us up. If he has saved us from spiritual and eternaldeath, we may thence hope, that in all our distresses he will be a verypresent help to us. The overruling providence of God frequently soorders it, that persecutors and oppressors are brought to ruin by theprojects they formed to destroy the people of God. Drunkards killthemselves; prodigals beggar themselves; the contentious bring mischiefupon themselves: thus men's sins may be read in their punishment, andit becomes plain to all, that the destruction of sinners is ofthemselves. All wickedness came originally with the wicked one fromhell; and those who continue in sin, must go to that place of torment.The true state, both of nations and of individuals, may be correctlyestimated by this one rule, whether in their doings they remember orforget God. David encourages the people of God to wait for hissalvation, though it should be long deferred. God will make it appearthat he never did forget them: it is not possible he should. Strangethat man, dust in his and about him, should yet need some sharpaffliction, some severe visitation from God, to bring him to theknowledge of himself, and make him feel who and what he is.
Psa 10:1-11	<br>God's withdrawings are very grievous to his people, especially in timesof trouble. We stand afar off from God by our unbelief, and thencomplain that God stands afar off from us. Passionate words against badmen do more hurt than good; if we speak of their badness, let it be tothe Lord in prayer; he can make them better. The sinner proudly gloriesin his power and success. Wicked people will not seek after God, thatis, will not call upon him. They live without prayer, and that isliving without God. They have many thoughts, many objects and devices,but think not of the Lord in any of them; they have no submission tohis will, nor aim for his glory. The cause of this is pride. Men thinkit below them to be religious. They could not break all the laws ofjustice and goodness toward man, if they had not first shaken off allsense of religion.
Psa 10:12-18	<br>The psalmist speaks with astonishment, at the wickedness of the wicked,and at the patience and forbearance of God. God prepares the heart forprayer, by kindling holy desires, and strengthening our most holyfaith, fixing the thoughts, and raising the affections, and then hegraciously accepts the prayer. The preparation of the heart is from theLord, and we must seek unto him for it. Let the poor, afflicted,persecuted, or tempted believer recollect, that Satan is the prince ofthis world, and that he is the father of all the ungodly. The childrenof God cannot expect kindness, truth, or justice from such persons ascrucified the Lord of glory. But this once suffering Jesus, now reignsas King over all the earth, and of his dominion there shall be no end.Let us commit ourselves unto him, humbly trusting in his mercy. He willrescue the believer from every temptation, and break the arm of everywicked oppressor, and bruise Satan under our feet shortly. But inheaven alone will all sin and temptation be shut out, though in thislife the believer has a foretaste of deliverance.
Psa 17:1-7	<br>This psalm is a prayer. Feigned prayers are fruitless; but if ourhearts lead our prayers, God will meet them with his favour. Thepsalmist had been used to pray, so that it was not his distress anddanger that now first brought him to his duty. And he was encouraged byhis faith to expect God would notice his prayers. Constant resolutionand watchfulness against sins of the tongue, will be a good evidence ofour integrity. Aware of man's propensity to wicked works, and of hisown peculiar temptations, David had made God's word his preservativefrom the paths of Satan, which lead to destruction. If we carefullyavoid the paths of sin, it will be very lead to destruction. If wecarefully avoid the paths of sin, it will be very comfortable in thereflection, when we are in trouble. Those that are, through grace,going in God's paths, should pray that their goings may be held up inthose paths. David prays, Lord, still hold me up. Those who wouldproceed and persevere in the ways of God, must, by faith prayer, getdaily fresh supplies of grace and strength from him. Show thymarvellous loving-kindness, distinguishing favours, not common mercies,but be gracious to me; do as thou usest to do to those who love thyname.
Psa 17:8-15	<br>Being compassed with enemies, David prays to God to keep him in safety.This prayer is a prediction that Christ would be preserved, through allthe hardships and difficulties of his humiliation, to the glories andjoys of his exalted state, and is a pattern to Christians to commit thekeeping of their souls to God, trusting him to preserve them to hisheavenly kingdom. Those are our worst enemies, that are enemies to oursouls. They are God's sword, which cannot move without him, and whichhe will sheathe when he has done his work with it. They are his hand,by which he chastises his people. There is no fleeing from God's hand,but by fleeing to it. It is very comfortable, when we are in fear ofthe power of man, to see it dependent upon, and in subjection to thepower of God. Most men look on the things of this world as the bestthings; and they look no further, nor show any care to provide foranother life. The things of this world are called treasures, they areso accounted; but to the soul, and when compared with eternalblessings, they are trash. The most afflicted Christian need not envythe most prosperous men of the world, who have their portion in thislife. Clothed with Christ's righteousness, having through his grace agood heart and a good life, may we by faith behold God's face, and sethim always before us. When we awake every morning, may we be satisfiedwith his likeness set before us in his word, and with his likenessstamped upon us by his renewing grace. Happiness in the other world isprepared only for those that are justified and sanctified: they shallbe put in possession of it when the soul awakes, at death, out of itsslumber in the body, and when the body awakes, at the resurrection, outof its slumber in the grave. There is no satisfaction for a soul but inGod, and in his good will towards us, and his good work in us; yet thatsatisfaction will not be perfect till we come to heaven.
Psa 18:1-19	<br>The first words, "I will love thee, O Lord, my strength," are the scopeand contents of the psalm. Those that truly love God, may triumph inhim as their Rock and Refuge, and may with confidence call upon him. Itis good for us to observe all the circumstances of a mercy whichmagnify the power of God and his goodness to us in it. David was apraying man, and God was found a prayer-hearing God. If we pray as hedid, we shall speed as he did. God's manifestation of his presence isvery fully described, 
Psa 18:7-15). Little appeared of man, but much ofGod, in these deliverances. It is not possible to apply to the historyof the son of Jesse those awful, majestic, and stupendous words whichare used through this description of the Divine manifestation. Everypart of so solemn a scene of terrors tells us, a greater than David ishere. God will not only deliver his people out of their troubles in duetime, but he will bear them up under their troubles in the mean time.Can we meditate on ver. 18, without directing one thought to Gethsemaneand Calvary? Can we forget that it was in the hour of Christ's deepestcalamity, when Judas betrayed, when his friends forsook, when themultitude derided him, and the smiles of his Father's love werewithheld, that the powers of darkness prevented him? The sorrows ofdeath surrounded him, in his distress he prayed, Heb 5:7. God made theearth to shake and tremble, and the rocks to cleave, and brought himout, in his resurrection, because he delighted in him and in hisundertaking.	
Psa 18:20-28	<br>Those that forsake the ways of the Lord, depart from their God. Butthough conscious to ourselves of many a false step, let there not be awicked departure from our God. David kept his eye upon the rule ofGod's commands. Constant care to keep from that sin, whatever it be,which most easily besets us, proves that we are upright before God.Those who show mercy to others, even they need mercy. Those who arefaithful to God, shall find him all that to them which he has promisedto be. The words of the Lord are pure words, very sure to be dependedon, and very sweet to be delighted in. Those who resist God, and walkcontrary to him, shall find that he will walk contrary to them, Le26:21-24. The gracious recompence of which David spoke, may generallybe expected by those who act from right motives. Hence he speakscomfort to the humble, and terror to the proud; "Thou wilt bring downhigh looks." And he speaks encouragement to himself; "Thou wilt lightmy candle:" thou wilt revive and comfort my sorrowful spirit; thou wiltguide my way, that I may avoid the snares laid for me. Thou wilt lightmy candle to work by, and give me an opportunity of serving thee. Letthose that walk in darkness, and labour under discouragements, takecourage; God himself will be a Light to them.
Psa 18:29-50	<br>When we praise for one mercy, we must observe the many more, with whichwe have been compassed all our days. Many things had contributed toDavid's advancement, and he owns the hand of God in them all, to teachus to do likewise. In verse #(32), and the following verses, are thegifts of God to the spiritual warrior, whereby he is prepared for thecontest, after the example of his victorious Leader. Learn that we mustseek release being made through Christ, shall be rejected. In David thetype, we behold out of trouble through Christ. The prayer put up,without reconciliation Jesus our Redeemer, conflicting with enemies,compassed with sorrows and with floods of ungodly men, enduring notonly the pains of death, but the wrath of God for us; yet calling uponthe Father with strong cries and tears; rescued from the grave;proceeding to reconcile, or to put under his feet all other enemies,till death, the last enemy, shall be destroyed. We should love theLord, our Strength, and our Salvation; we should call on him in everytrouble, and praise him for every deliverance; we should aim to walkwith him in all righteousness and true holiness, keeping from sin. Ifwe belong to him, he conquers and reigns for us, and we shall conquerand reign through him, and partake of the mercy of our anointed King,which is promised to all his seed for evermore. Amen.
Psa 19:1-6	<br>The heavens so declare the glory of God, and proclaim his wisdom,power, and goodness, that all ungodly men are left without excuse. Theyspeak themselves to be works of God's hands; for they must have aCreator who is eternal, infinitely wise, powerful, and good. Thecounter-changing of day and night is a great proof of the power of God,and calls us to observe, that, as in the kingdom of nature, so in thatof providence, he forms the light, and creates the darkness, Isa 45:7,and sets the one against the other. The sun in the firmament is anemblem of the Sun of righteousness, the Bridegroom of the church, andthe Light of the world, diffusing Divine light and salvation by hisgospel to the nations of the earth. He delights to bless his church,which he has espoused to himself; and his course will be unwearied asthat of the sun, till the whole earth is filled with his light andsalvation. Let us pray for the time when he shall enlighten, cheer, andmake fruitful every nation on earth, with the blessed salvation. Theyhave no speech or language, so some read it, and yet their voice isheard. All people may hear these preachers speak in their own tonguethe wonderful works of God. Let us give God the glory of all thecomfort and benefit we have by the lights of heaven, still lookingabove and beyond them to the Sun of righteousness.
Psa 19:7-10	<br>The Holy Scripture is of much greater benefit to us than day or night,than the air we breathe, or the light of the sun. To recover man out ofhis fallen state, there is need of the word of God. The word translated"law," may be rendered doctrine, and be understood as meaning all thatteaches us true religion. The whole is perfect; its tendency is toconvert or turn the soul from sin and the world, to God and holiness.It shows our sinfulness and misery in departing from God, and thenecessity of our return to him. This testimony is sure, to be fullydepended on: the ignorant and unlearned believing what God saith,become wise unto salvation. It is a sure direction in the way of duty.It is a sure fountain of living comforts, and a sure foundation oflasting hopes. The statues of the Lord are right, just as they shouldbe; and, because they are right, they rejoice the heart. Thecommandments of the Lord are pure, holy, just, and good. By them wediscover our need of a Saviour; and then learn how to adorn his gospel.They are the means which the Holy Spirit uses in enlightening the eyes;they bring us to a sight and sense of our sin and misery, and direct usin the way of duty. The fear of the Lord, that is, true religion andgodliness, is clean, it will cleanse our way; and it endureth for ever.The ceremonial law is long since done away, but the law concerning thefear of God is ever the same. The judgments of the Lord, his precepts,are true; they are righteous, and they are so altogether; there is nounrighteousness in any of them. Gold is only for the body, and theconcerns of time; but grace is for the soul, and the concerns ofeternity. The word of God, received by faith, is more precious thangold; it is sweet to the soul, sweeter than honey. The pleasure ofsense soon surfeit, yet never satisfy; but those of religion aresubstantial and satisfying; there is no danger of excess.
Psa 19:11-14	<br>God's word warns the wicked not to go on in his wicked way, and warnsthe righteous not to turn from his good way. There is a reward, notonly after keeping, but in keeping God's commandments. Religion makesour comforts sweet, and our crosses easy, life truly valuable, anddeath itself truly desirable. David not only desired to be pardoned andcleansed from the sins he had discovered and confessed, but from thosehe had forgotten or overlooked. All discoveries of sin made to us bythe law, should drive us to the throne of grace, there to pray. Hisdependence was the same with that of every Christian who says, Surelyin the Lord Jesus have I righteousness and strength. No prayer can beacceptable before God which is not offered in the strength of ourRedeemer or Divine Kinsman, through Him who took our nature upon him,that he might redeem us unto God, and restore the long-lostinheritance. May our hearts be much affected with the excellence of theword of God; and much affected with the evil of sin, and the danger weare in of it, and the danger we are in by it.
Psa 21:1-6	<br>Happy the people whose king makes God's strength his confidence, andGod's salvation his joy; who is pleased with all the advancements ofGod kingdom, and trusts God to support him in all he does for theservice of it. All our blessings are blessings of goodness, and areowing, not to any merit of ours, but only to God's goodness. But whenGod's blessings come sooner, and prove richer than we imagine; whenthey are given before we prayed for them, before we were ready forthem, nay, when we feared the contrary; then it may be truly said thathe prevented, or went before us, with them. Nothing indeed prevented,or went before Christ, but to mankind never was any favour morepreventing than our redemption by Christ. Thou hast made him to be auniversal, everlasting blessing to the world, in whom the families ofthe earth are, and shall be blessed; and so thou hast made himexceeding glad with the countenance thou hast given to his undertaking,and to him in the prosecution of it. The Spirit of prophecy rises fromwhat related to the king, to that which is peculiar to Christ; noneother is blessed for ever, much less a blessing for ever.
Psa 21:7-13	<br>The psalmist teaches to look forward with faith, and hope, and prayerupon what God would further do. The success with which God blessedDavid, was a type of the total overthrow of all Christ's enemies. Thosewho might have had Christ to rule and save them, but rejected him andfought against him, shall find the remembrance of it a worm that diesnot. God makes sinners willing by his grace, receives them to hisfavour, and delivers them from the wrath to come. May he exalt himself,by his all-powerful grace, in our hearts, destroying all thestrong-holds of sin and Satan. How great should be our joy and praiseto behold our Brother and Friend upon the throne, and for all theblessings we may expect from him! yet he delights in his exalted state,as enabling him to confer happiness and glory on poor sinners, who aretaught to love and trust in him.
Psa 22:1-10	<br>The Spirit of Christ, which was in the prophets, testifies in thispsalm, clearly and fully, the sufferings of Christ, and the glory thatshould follow. We have a sorrowful complaint of God's withdrawings.This may be applied to any child of God, pressed down, overwhelmed withgrief and terror. Spiritual desertions are the saints' sorestafflictions; but even their complaint of these burdens is a sign ofspiritual life, and spiritual senses exercised. To cry our, My God, whyam I sick? why am I poor? savours of discontent and worldliness. But,"Why hast thou forsaken me?" is the language of a heart binding up itshappiness in God's favour. This must be applied to Christ. In the firstwords of this complaint, he poured out his soul before God when he wasupon the cross, Mt 27:46. Being truly man, Christ felt a naturalunwillingness to pass through such great sorrows, yet his zeal and loveprevailed. Christ declared the holiness of God, his heavenly Father, inhis sharpest sufferings; nay, declared them to be a proof of it, forwhich he would be continually praised by his Israel, more than for allother deliverances they received. Never any that hoped in thee, weremade ashamed of their hope; never any that sought thee, sought thee invain. Here is a complaint of the contempt and reproach of men. TheSaviour here spoke of the abject state to which he was reduced. Thehistory of Christ's sufferings, and of his birth, explains thisprophecy.
Psa 22:11-21	<br>In these verses we have Christ suffering, and Christ praying; by whichwe are directed to look for crosses, and to look up to God under them.The very manner of Christ's death is described, though not in use amongthe Jews. They pierced his hands and his feet, which were nailed to theaccursed tree, and his whole body was left so to hang as to suffer themost severe pain and torture. His natural force failed, being wasted bythe fire of Divine wrath preying upon his spirits. Who then can standbefore God's anger? or who knows the power of it? The life of thesinner was forfeited, and the life of the Sacrifice must be the ransomfor it. Our Lord Jesus was stripped, when he was crucified, that hemight clothe us with the robe of his righteousness. Thus it waswritten, therefore thus it behoved Christ to suffer. Let all thisconfirm our faith in him as the true Messiah, and excite our love tohim as the best of friends, who loved us, and suffered all this for us.Christ in his agony prayed, prayed earnestly, prayed that the cup mightpass from him. When we cannot rejoice in God as our song, yet let usstay ourselves upon him as our strength; and take the comfort ofspiritual supports, when we cannot have spiritual delights. He prays tobe delivered from the Divine wrath. He that has delivered, dothdeliver, and will do so. We should think upon the sufferings andresurrection of Christ, till we feel in our souls the power of hisresurrection, and the fellowship of his sufferings.
Psa 22:22-31	<br>The Saviour now speaks as risen from the dead. The first words of thecomplaint were used by Christ himself upon the cross; the first wordsof the triumph are expressly applied to him, Heb 2:12. All our praisesmust refer to the work of redemption. The suffering of the Redeemer wasgraciously accepted as a full satisfaction for sin. Though it wasoffered for sinful men, the Father did not despise or abhor it for oursakes. This ought to be the matter of our thanksgiving. All humble,gracious souls should have a full satisfaction and happiness in him.Those that hunger and thirst after righteousness in Christ, shall notlabour for that which satisfies not. Those that are much in praying,will be much in thanksgiving. Those that turn to God, will makeconscience of worshipping before him. Let every tongue confess that heis Lord. High and low, rich and poor, bond and free, meet in Christ.Seeing we cannot keep alive our own souls, it is our wisdom, byobedient faith, to commit our souls to Christ, who is able to save andkeep them alive for ever. A seed shall serve him. God will have achurch in the world to the end of time. They shall be accounted to himfor a generation; he will be the same to them that he was to those whowent before them. His righteousness, and not any of their own, theyshall declare to be the foundation of all their hopes, and the fountainof all their joys. Redemption by Christ is the Lord's own doing. Herewe see the free love and compassion of God the Father, and of our LordJesus Christ, for us wretched sinners, as the source of all grace andconsolation; the example we are to follow, the treatment as Christianswe are to expect, and the conduct under it we are to adopt. Everylesson may here be learned that can profit the humbled soul. Let thosewho go about to establish their own righteousness inquire, why thebeloved Son of God should thus suffer, if their own doings could atonefor sin? Let the ungodly professor consider whether the Saviour thushonoured the Divine law, to purchase him the privilege of despising it.Let the careless take warning to flee from the wrath to come, and thetrembling rest their hopes upon this merciful Redeemer. Let the temptedand distressed believer cheerfully expect a happy end of every trial.
Psa 24:1-6	<br>We ourselves are not our own; our bodies, our souls, are not. Eventhose of the children of men are God's, who know him not, nor own theirrelation to him. A soul that knows and considers its own nature, andthat it must live for ever, when it has viewed the earth and thefulness thereof, will sit down unsatisfied. It will think of ascendingtoward God, and will ask, What shall I do, that I may abide in thathappy, holy place, where he makes his people holy and happy? We makenothing of religion, if we do not make heart-work of it. We can only becleansed from our sins, and renewed unto holiness, by the blood ofChrist and the washing of the Holy Ghost. Thus we become his people;thus we receive blessing from the Lord, and righteousness from the Godof our salvation. God's peculiar people shall be made truly and forever happy. Where God gives righteousness, he designs salvation. Thosethat are made meet for heaven, shall be brought safe to heaven, andwill find what they have been seeking.
Psa 24:7-10	<br>The splendid entry here described, refers to the solemn bringing in ofthe ark into the tent David pitched for it, or the temple Solomon builtfor it. We may also apply it to the ascension of Christ into heaven,and the welcome given to him there. Our Redeemer found the gates ofheaven shut, but having by his blood made atonement for sin, as onehaving authority, he demanded entrance. The angels were to worship him,Heb 1:6: they ask with wonder, Who is he? It is answered, that he isstrong and mighty; mighty in battle to save his people, and to subduehis and their enemies. We may apply it to Christ's entrance into thesouls of men by his word and Spirit, that they may be his temples.Behold, he stands at the door, and knocks, Rev 3:20. The gates anddoors of the heart are to be opened to him, as possession is deliveredto the rightful owner. We may apply it to his second coming withglorious power. Lord, open the everlasting door of our souls by thygrace, that we may now receive thee, and be wholly thine; and that, atlength, we may be numbered with thy saints in glory.
Psa 25:1-7	<br>In worshipping God, we must lift up our souls to him. It is certainthat none who, by a believing attendance, wait on God, and, by abelieving hope, wait for him, shall be ashamed of it. The most advancedbeliever both needs and desires to be taught of God. If we sincerelydesire to know our duty, with resolution to do it, we may be sure thatGod will direct us in it. The psalmist is earnest for the pardon of hissins. When God pardons sin, he is said to remember it no more, whichdenotes full remission. It is God's goodness, and not ours, his mercy,and not our merit, that must be our plea for the pardon of sin, and allthe good we need. This plea we must rely upon, feeling our ownunworthiness, and satisfied of the riches of God's mercy and grace. Howboundless is that mercy which covers for ever the sins and follies of ayouth spent without God and without hope! Blessed be the Lord, theblood of the great Sacrifice can wash away every stain.
Psa 25:8-14	<br>We are all sinners; and Christ came into the world to save sinners, toteach sinners, to call sinners to repentance. We value a promise by thecharacter of him that makes it; we therefore depend upon God'spromises. All the paths of the Lord, that is, all his promises and allhis providences, are mercy and truth. In all God's dealings his peoplemay see his mercy displayed, and his word fulfilled, whateverafflictions they are now exercised with. All the paths of the Lord aremercy and truth; and so it will appear when they come to theirjourney's end. Those that are humble, that distrust themselves, anddesire to be taught and to follow Divine guidance, these he will guidein judgment, that is, by the rule of the written word, to find rest fortheir souls in the Saviour. Even when the body is sick, and in pain,the soul may be at ease in God.
Psa 25:15-22	<br>The psalmist concludes, as he began, with expressing dependence uponGod, and desire toward him. It is good thus to hope, and quietly towait for the salvation of the Lord. And if God turns to us, no matterwho turns from us. He pleads his own integrity. Though guilty beforeGod, yet, as to his enemies, he had the testimony of conscience that hehad done them no wrong. God would, at length, give Israel rest from alltheir enemies round about. In heaven, God's Israel will be perfectlyredeemed from all troubles. Blessed Saviour, thou hast graciouslytaught us that without thee we can do nothing. Do thou teach us how topray, how to appear before thee in the way which thou shalt choose, andhow to lift up our whole hearts and desires after thee, for thou artthe Lord our righteousness.
Psa 27:1-6	<br>The Lord, who is the believer's light, is the strength of his life; notonly by whom, but in whom he lives and moves. In God let us strengthenourselves. The gracious presence of God, his power, his promise, hisreadiness to hear prayer, the witness of his Spirit in the hearts ofhis people; these are the secret of his tabernacle, and in these thesaints find cause for that holy security and peace of mind in whichthey dwell at ease. The psalmist prays for constant communion with Godin holy ordinances. All God's children desire to dwell in theirFather's house. Not to sojourn there as a wayfaring man, to tarry butfor a night; or to dwell there for a time only, as the servant thatabides not in the house for ever; but to dwell there all the days oftheir life, as children with a father. Do we hope that the praising ofGod will be the blessedness of our eternity? Surely then we ought tomake it the business of our time. This he had at heart more than anything. Whatever the Christian is as to this life, he considers thefavour and service of God as the one thing needful. This he desires,prays for and seeks after, and in it he rejoices.
Psa 27:7-14	<br>Wherever the believer is, he can find a way to the throne of grace byprayer. God calls us by his Spirit, by his word, by his worship, and byspecial providences, merciful and afflicting. When we are foolishlymaking court to lying vanities, God is, in love to us, calling us toseek our own mercies in him. The call is general, "Seek ye my face;"but we must apply it to ourselves, "I will seek it." The word does usno good, when we do not ourselves accept the exhortation: a graciousheart readily answers to the call of a gracious God, being made willingin the day of his power. The psalmist requests the favour of the Lord;the continuance of his presence with him; the benefit of Divineguidance, and the benefit of Divine protection. God's time to helpthose that trust in him, is, when all other helpers fail. He is a surerand better Friend than earthly parents are, or can be. What was thebelief which supported the psalmist? That he should see the goodness ofthe Lord. There is nothing like the believing hope of eternal life, theforesights of that glory, and foretastes of those pleasures, to keep usfrom fainting under all calamities. In the mean time he should bestrengthened to bear up under his burdens. Let us look unto thesuffering Saviour, and pray in faith, not to be delivered into thehands of our enemies. Let us encourage each other to wait on the Lord,with patient expectation, and fervent prayer.
Psa 28:1-5	<br>David is very earnest in prayer. Observe his faith in prayer; God is myrock, on whom I build my hope. Believers should not rest till they havereceived some token that their prayers are heard. He prays that he maynot be numbered with the wicked. Save me from being entangled in thesnares they have laid for me. Save me from being infected with theirsins, and from doing as they do. Lord, never leave me to use such artsof deceit and treachery for my safety, as they use for my ruin.Believers dread the way of sinners; the best are sensible of the dangerthey are in of being drawn aside: we should all pray earnestly to Godfor his grace to keep us. Those who are careful not to partake withsinners in their sins, have reason to hope that they shall not receivetheir plagues. He speaks of the just judgments of the Lord on theworkers of iniquity, 
Psa 28:4	<br>This is not the language of passion orrevenge. It is a prophecy that there will certainly come a day, whenGod will punish every man who persists in his evil deeds. Sinners shallbe reckoned with, not only for the mischief they have done, but for themischief they designed, and did what they could to effect. Disregard ofthe works of the Lord, is the cause of the sin of sinners, and becomesthe cause of their ruin.
Psa 28:6-9	<br>Has God heard our supplications? Let us then bless his name. The Lordis my strength, to support me, and carry me on through all my servicesand sufferings. The heart that truly believes, shall in due timegreatly rejoice: we are to expect joy and peace in believing. God shallhave the praise of it: thus must we express our gratitude. The saintsrejoice in others' comfort as well as their own: we have the lessbenefit from the light of the sun, nor from the light of God'scountenance, for others' sharing therein. The psalmist concludes with ashort, but comprehensive prayer. God's people are his inheritance, andprecious in his eyes. He prays that God would save them; that he wouldbless them with all good, especially the plenty of his ordinances,which are food to the soul. And direct their actions and overrule theiraffairs for good. Also, lift them up for ever; not only those of thatage, but his people in every age to come; lift them up as high asheaven. There, and there only, will saints be lifted up for ever, nevermore to sink, or be depressed. Save us, Lord Jesus, from our sins;bless us, thou Son of Abraham, with the blessing of righteousness; feedus, thou good Shepherd of the sheep, and lift us up for ever from thedust, O thou, who art the Resurrection and the Life.
Psa 30:1-5	<br>The great things the Lord has done for us, both by his providence andby his grace, bind us in gratitude to do all we can to advance hiskingdom among men, though the most we can do is but little. God'ssaints in heaven sing to him; why should not those on earth do thesame? Not one of all God's perfections carries in it more terror to thewicked, or more comfort to the godly, than his holiness. It is a goodsign that we are in some measure partakers of his holiness, if we canheartily rejoice at the remembrance of it. Our happiness is bound up inthe Divine favour; if we have that, we have enough, whatever else wewant; but as long as God's anger continues, so long the saints' weepingcontinues.
Psa 30:6-12	<br>When things are well with us, we are very apt to think that they willalways be so. When we see our mistake, it becomes us to think withshame upon our carnal security as our folly. If God hide his face, agood man is troubled, though no other calamity befal him. But if God,in wisdom and justice, turn from us, it will be the greatest folly ifwe turn from him. No; let us learn to pray in the dark. The sanctifiedspirit, which returns to God, shall praise him, shall be still praisinghim; but the services of God's house cannot be performed by the dust;it cannot praise him; there is none of that device or working in thegrave, for it is the land of silence. We ask aright for life, when wedo so that we may live to praise him. In due time God delivered thepsalmist out of his troubles. Our tongue is our glory, and never moreso than when employed in praising God. He would persevere to the end inpraise, hoping that he should shortly be where this would be theeverlasting work. But let all beware of carnal security. Neitheroutward prosperity, nor inward peace, here, are sure and lasting. TheLord, in his favour, has fixed the believer's safety firm as thedeep-rooted mountains, but he must expect to meet with temptations andafflictions. When we grow careless, we fall into sin, the Lord hideshis face, our comforts droop, and troubles assail us.
Psa 31:1-8	<br>Faith and prayer must go together, for the prayer of faith is theprevailing prayer. David gave up his soul in a special manner to God.And with the words, ver. 5, our Lord Jesus yielded up his last breathon the cross, and made his soul a free-will offering for sin, layingdown his life as a ransom. But David is here as a man in distress andtrouble. And his great care is about his soul, his spirit, his betterpart. Many think that while perplexed about their worldly affairs, andtheir cares multiply, they may be excused if they neglect their souls;but we are the more concerned to look to our souls, that, though theoutward man perish, the inward man may suffer no damage. The redemptionof the soul is so precious, that it must have ceased for ever, ifChrist had not undertaken it. Having relied on God's mercy, he will beglad and rejoice in it. God looks upon our souls, when we are introuble, to see whether they are humbled for sin, and made better bythe affliction. Every believer will meet with such dangers anddeliverances, until he is delivered from death, his last enemy.
Psa 31:9-18	<br>David's troubles made him a man of sorrows. Herein he was a type ofChrist, who was acquainted with grief. David acknowledged that hisafflictions were merited by his own sins, but Christ suffered for ours.David's friends durst not give him any assistance. Let us not think itstrange if thus deserted, but make sure of a Friend in heaven who willnot fail. God will be sure to order and dispose all for the best, toall those who commit their spirits also into his hand. The time of lifeis in God's hands, to lengthen or shorten, make bitter or sweet,according to the counsel of his will. The way of man is not in himself,nor in our friend's hands, nor in our enemies' hands, but in God's. Inthis faith and confidence he prays that the Lord would save him for hismercies's sake, and not for any merit of his own. He prophesies thesilencing of those that reproach and speak evil of the people of God.There is a day coming, when the Lord will execute judgment upon them.In the mean time, we should engage ourselves by well-doing, ifpossible, to silence the ignorance of foolish men.
Psa 31:19-24	<br>Instead of yielding to impatience or despondency under our troubles, weshould turn our thoughts to the goodness of the Lord towards those whofear and trust in Him. All comes to sinners through the wondrous giftof the only-begotten Son of God, to be the atonement for their sins.Let not any yield to unbelief, or think, under discouragingcircumstances, that they are cut off from before the eyes of the Lord,and left to the pride of men. Lord, pardon our complaints and fears;increase our faith, patience, love, and gratitude; teach us to rejoicein tribulation and in hope. The deliverance of Christ, with thedestruction of his enemies, ought to strengthen and comfort the heartsof believers under all their afflictions here below, that havingsuffered courageously with their Master, they may triumphantly enterinto his joy and glory.
Psa 32:1,2	<br>Sin is the cause of our misery; but the true believer's transgressionsof the Divine law are all forgiven, being covered with the atonement.Christ bare his sins, therefore they are not imputed to him. Therighteousness of Christ being reckoned to us, and we being made therighteousness of God in him, our iniquity is not imputed, God havinglaid upon him the iniquity of us all, and made him a sin-offering forus. Not to impute sin, is God's act, for he is the Judge. It is Godthat justifies. Notice the character of him whose sins are pardoned; heis sincere, and seeks sanctification by the power of the Holy Ghost. Hedoes not profess to repent, with an intention to indulge in sin,because the Lord is ready to forgive. He will not abuse the doctrine offree grace. And to the man whose iniquity is forgiven, all manner ofblessings are promised.
Psa 32:3-7	<br>It is very difficult to bring sinful man humbly to accept free mercy,with a full confession of his sins and self-condemnation. But the trueand only way to peace of conscience, is, to confess our sins, that theymay be forgiven; to declare them that we may be justified. Althoughrepentance and confession do not merit the pardon of transgression,they are needful to the real enjoyment of forgiving mercy. And whattongue can tell the happiness of that hour, when the soul, oppressed bysin, is enabled freely to pour forth its sorrows before God, and totake hold of his covenanted mercy in Christ Jesus! Those that wouldspeed in prayer, must seek the Lord, when, by his providence, he callsthem to seek him, and, by his Spirit, stirs them up to seek him. In atime of finding, when the heart is softened with grief, and burdenedwith guilt; when all human refuge fails; when no rest can be found tothe troubled mind, then it is that God applies the healing balm by hisSpirit.
Psa 32:8-11	<br>God teaches by his word, and guides with the secret intimations of hiswill. David gives a word of caution to sinners. The reason for thiscaution is, that the way of sin will certainly end in sorrow. Here is aword of comfort to saints. They may see that a life of communion withGod is far the most pleasant and comfortable. Let us rejoice, O LordJesus, in thee, and in thy salvation; so shall we rejoice indeed.
Psa 33:1-11	<br>Holy joy is the heart and soul of praise, and that is here pressed uponthe righteous. Thankful praise is the breath and language of holy joy.Religious songs are proper expressions of thankful praise. Everyendowment we possess, should be employed with all our skill andearnestness in God's service. His promises are all wise and good. Hisword is right, and therefore we are only in the right when we agreewith it. His works are all done in truth. He is the righteous Lord,therefore loveth righteousness. What a pity it is that this earth,which is so full of the proofs and instances of God's goodness, shouldbe so empty of his praises; and that of the multitudes who live uponhis bounty, there are so few who live to his glory! What the Lord does,he does to purpose; it stands fast. He overrules all the counsels ofmen, and makes them serve his counsels; even that is fulfilled, whichto us is most surprising, the eternal counsel of God, nor can any thingprevent its coming to pass.
Psa 33:12-22	<br>All the motions and operations of the souls of men, which no mortalsknow but themselves, God knows better than they do. Their hearts, aswell as their times, are all in his hand; he formed the spirit of eachman within him. All the powers of the creature depend upon him, and areof no account, of no avail at all, without him. If we make God's favoursure towards us, then we need not fear whatever is against us. We areto give to him the glory of his special grace. All human devices forthe salvation of our souls are vain; but the Lord's watchful eye isover those whose conscientious fear of his name proceeds from abelieving hope in his mercy. In difficulties they shall be helped; indangers they shall not receive any real damage. Those that fear God andhis wrath, must hope in God and his mercy; for there is no flying fromhim, but by flying to him. Let thy mercy, O Lord, be upon us; let usalways have the comfort and benefit, not according to our merits, butaccording to the promise which thou hast in thy word given to us, andaccording to the faith thou hast by thy Spirit and grace wrought in us.
Psa 34:1-10	<br>If we hope to spend eternity in praising God, it is fit that we shouldspend much of our time here in this work. He never said to any one,Seek ye me in vain. David's prayers helped to silence his fears; manybesides him have looked unto the Lord by faith and prayer, and it haswonderfully revived and comforted them. When we look to the world, weare perplexed, and at a loss. But on looking to Christ depends ourwhole salvation, and all things needful thereunto do so also. This poorman, whom no man looked upon with any respect, or looked after with anyconcern, was yet welcome to the throne of grace; the Lord heard him,and saved him out of all his troubles. The holy angels minister to thesaints, and stand for them against the powers of darkness. All theglory be to the Lord of the angels. By taste and sight we both makediscoveries, and have enjoyment; Taste and see God's goodness; takenotice of it, and take the comfort of it. He makes all truly blessedthat trust in him. As to the things of the other world, they shall havegrace sufficient for the support of spiritual life. And as to thislife, they shall have what is necessary from the hand of God. Paul hadall, and abounded, because he was content, Php 4:11-18. Those who trustto themselves, and think their own efforts sufficient for them, shallwant; but they shall be fed who trust in the Lord. Those shall notwant, who with quietness work, and mind their own business.
Psa 34:11-22	<br>Let young persons set out in life with learning the fear of the Lord,if they desire true comfort here, and eternal happiness hereafter.Those will be most happy who begin the soonest to serve so good aMaster. All aim to be happy. Surely this must look further than thepresent world; for man's life on earth consists but of few days, andthose full of trouble. What man is he that would see the good of thatwhere all bliss is perfect? Alas! few have this good in their thoughts.That religion promises best which creates watchfulness over the heartand over the tongue. It is not enough not to do hurt, we must study tobe useful, and to live to some purpose; we must seek peace and pursueit; be willing to deny ourselves a great deal for peace' sake. It isthe constant practice of real believers, when in distress, to cry untoGod, and it is their constant comfort that he hears them. The righteousare humbled for sin, and are low in their own eyes. Nothing is moreneedful to true godliness than a contrite heart, broken off from everyself-confidence. In this soil every grace will flourish, and nothingcan encourage such a one but the free, rich grace of the gospel ofJesus Christ. The righteous are taken under the special protection ofthe Lord, yet they have their share of crosses in this world, and thereare those that hate them. Both from the mercy of Heaven, and the maliceof hell, the afflictions of the righteous must be many. But whatevertroubles befal them, shall not hurt their souls, for God keeps themfrom sinning in troubles. No man is desolate, but he whom God hasforsaken.
Psa 35:1-10	<br>It is no new thing for the most righteous men, and the most righteouscause, to meet with enemies. This is a fruit of the old enmity in theseed of the serpent against the Seed of the woman. David in hisafflictions, Christ in his sufferings, the church under persecution,and the Christian in the hour temptation, all beseech the Almighty toappear in their behalf, and to vindicate their cause. We are apt tojustify uneasiness at the injuries men do us, by our never having giventhem cause to use us so ill; but this should make us easy, for then wemay the more expect that God will plead our cause. David prayed to Godto manifest himself in his trial. Let me have inward comfort under alloutward troubles, to support my soul. If God, by his Spirit, witness toour spirits that he is our salvation, we need desire no more to make ushappy. If God is our Friend, no matter who is our enemy. By the Spiritof prophecy, David foretells the just judgments of God that would comeupon his enemies for their great wickedness. These are predictions,they look forward, and show the doom of the enemies of Christ and hiskingdom. We must not desire or pray for the ruin of any enemies, exceptour lusts and the evil spirits that would compass our destruction. Atraveller benighted in a bad road, is an expressive emblem of a sinnerwalking in the slippery and dangerous ways of temptation. But Davidhaving committed his cause to God, did not doubt of his owndeliverance. The bones are the strongest parts of the body. Thepsalmist here proposes to serve and glorify God with all his strength.If such language may be applied to outward salvation, how much morewill it apply to heavenly things in Christ Jesus!
Psa 35:11-16	<br>Call a man ungrateful, and you can call him no worse: this was thecharacter of David's enemies. Herein he was a type of Christ. Davidshows how tenderly he had behaved towards them in afflictions. We oughtto mourn for the sins of those who do not mourn for themselves. Weshall not lose by the good offices we do to any, how ungrateful soeverthey may be. Let us learn to possess our souls in patience and meeknesslike David, or rather after Christ's example.
Psa 35:17-28	<br>Though the people of God are, and study to be, quiet, yet it has beencommon for their enemies to devise deceitful matters against them.David prays, My soul is in danger, Lord, rescue it; it belongs to theethe Father of spirits, therefore claim thine own; it is thine, save it!Lord, be not far from me, as if I were a stranger. He who exalted theonce suffering Redeemer, will appear for all his people: the roaringlion shall not destroy their souls, any more than he could that ofChrist, their Surety. They trust their souls in his hands, they are onewith him by faith, are precious in his sight, and shall be rescued fromdestruction, that they may give thanks in heaven.
Psa 36:1-4	<br>From this psalm our hearts should be duly affected with hatred of sin,and seek satisfaction in God's loving-kindness. Here is the root ofbitterness, from which all the wickedness of wicked men comes. It takesrise from contempt of God, and the want of due regard to him. Also fromthe deceit they put upon their own souls. Let us daily beg of God topreserve us from self-flattery. Sin is very hurtful to the sinnerhimself, and therefore ought to be hateful; but it is not so. It is nomarvel, if those that deceive themselves, seek to deceive all mankind;to whom will they be true, who are false to their own souls? It is badto do mischief, but worse to devise it, to do it with plot andmanagement. If we willingly banish holy meditations in our solitaryhours, Satan will soon occupy our minds with sinful imaginations.Hardened sinners stand to what they have done, as though they couldjustify it before God himself.
Psa 36:5-12	<br>Men may shut up their compassion, yet, with God we shall find mercy.This is great comfort to all believers, plainly to be seen, and not tobe taken away. God does all wisely and well; but what he does we knownot now, it is time enough to know hereafter. God's loving-kindness isprecious to the saints. They put themselves under his protection, andthen are safe and easy. Gracious souls, though still desiring more ofGod, never desire more than God. The gifts of Providence so far satisfythem, that they are content with such things as they have. The benefitof holy ordinances is sweet to a sanctified soul, and strengthening tothe spiritual and Divine life. But full satisfaction is reserved forthe future state. Their joys shall be constant. God not only works inthem a gracious desire for these pleasures, but by his Spirit fillstheir souls with joy and peace in believing. He quickens whom he will;and whoever will, may come, and take from him of the waters of lifefreely. May we know, and love, and uprightly serve the Lord; then noproud enemy, on earth or from hell, shall separate us from his love.Faith calleth things that are not, as though they were. It carries usforward to the end of time; it shows us the Lord, on his throne ofjudgment; the empire of sin fallen to rise no more.
Psa 37:1-6	<br>When we look abroad we see the world full of evil-doers, that flourishand live in ease. So it was seen of old, therefore let us not marvel atthe matter. We are tempted to fret at this, to think them the onlyhappy people, and so we are prone to do like them: but this we arewarned against. Outward prosperity is fading. When we look forward,with an eye of faith, we shall see no reason to envy the wicked. Theirweeping and wailing will be everlasting. The life of religion is abelieving trust in the Lord, and diligent care to serve him accordingto his will. It is not trusting God, but tempting him, if we do notmake conscience of our duty to him. A man's life consists not inabundance, but, Thou shalt have food convenient for thee. This is morethan we deserve, and it is enough for one that is going to heaven. Todelight in God is as much a privilege as a duty. He has not promised togratify the appetites of the body, and the humours of the fancy, butthe desires of the renewed, sanctified soul. What is the desire of theheart of a good man? It is this, to know, and love, and serve God.Commit thy way unto the Lord; roll thy way upon the Lord, so the marginreads it. Cast thy burden upon the Lord, the burden of thy care. Wemust roll it off ourselves, not afflict and perplex ourselves withthoughts about future events, but refer them to God. By prayer spreadthy case and all thy cares before the Lord, and trust in him. We mustdo our duty, and then leave the event with God. The promise is verysweet: He shall bring that to pass, whatever it is, which thou hascommitted to him.
Psa 37:7-20	<br>Let us be satisfied that God will make all to work for good to us. Letus not discompose ourselves at what we see in this world. A fretful,discontented spirit is open to many temptations. For, in all respects,the little which is allotted to the righteous, is more comfortable andmore profitable than the ill-gotten and abused riches of ungodly men.It comes from a hand of special love. God provides plentifully andwell, not only for his working servants, but for his waiting servants.They have that which is better than wealth, peace of mind, peace withGod, and then peace in God; that peace which the world cannot give, andwhich the world cannot have. God knows the believer's days. Not oneday's work shall go unrewarded. Their time on earth is reckoned bydays, which will soon be numbered; but heavenly happiness shall be forever. This will be a real support to believers in evil times. Thosethat rest on the Rock of ages, have no reason to envy the wicked thesupport of their broken reeds.
Psa 37:21-33	<br>The Lord our God requires that we do justly, and render to all theirdue. It is a great sin for those that are able, to deny the payment ofjust debts; it is a great misery not to be able to pay them. He that istruly merciful, will be ever merciful. We must leave our sins; learn todo well, and cleave to it. This is true religion. The blessing of Godis the spring, sweetness, and security of all earthly enjoyments. Andif we are sure of this, we are sure not to want any thing good for usin this world. By his grace and Holy Spirit, he directs the thoughts,affections, and designs of good men. By his providence he overrulesevents, so as to make their way plain. He does not always show them hisway for a distance, but leads them step by step, as children are led.God will keep them from being ruined by their falls, either into sin orinto trouble, though such as fall into sin will be sorely hurt. Few, ifany, have known the consistent believer, or his children, reduced toabject, friendless want. God forsakes not his saints in affliction; andin heaven only the righteous shall dwell for ever; that will be theireverlasting habitation. A good man may fall into the hands of amessenger of Satan, and be sorely buffeted, but God will not leave himin his enemy's hands.
Psa 37:34-40	<br>Duty is ours, and we must mind it; but events are God's, we must referthe disposal of them to him. What a striking picture is in 
Psa 37:35,36), of many a prosperous enemy of God! But God remarkably blights theprojects of the prosperous wicked, especially persecutors. None areperfect in themselves, but believers are so in Christ Jesus. If all thesaint's days continue dark and cloudy, his dying day may provecomfortable, and his sun set bright; or, if it should set under acloud, yet his future state will be everlasting peace. The salvation ofthe righteous will be the Lord's doing. He will help them to do theirduties, to bear their burdens; help them to bear their troubles well,and get good by them, and, in due time, will deliver them out of theirtroubles. Let sinners then depart from evil, and do good; repent of andforsake sin, and trust in the mercy of God through Jesus Christ. Letthem take his yoke upon them, and learn of him, that they may dwell forevermore in heaven. Let us mark the closing scenes of differentcharacters, and always depend on God's mercy.	
Psa 38:1-11	<br>Nothing will disquiet the heart of a good man so much as the sense ofGod's anger. The way to keep the heart quiet, is to keep ourselves inthe love of God. But a sense of guilt is too heavy to bear; and wouldsink men into despair and ruin, unless removed by the pardoning mercyof God. If there were not sin in our souls, there would be no pain inour bones, no illness in our bodies. The guilt of sin is a burden tothe whole creation, which groans under it. It will be a burden to thesinners themselves, when they are heavy-laden under it, or a burden ofruin, when it sinks them to hell. When we perceive our true condition,the Good Physician will be valued, sought, and obeyed. Yet many lettheir wounds rankle, because they delay to go to their merciful Friend.When, at any time, we are distempered in our bodies, we ought toremember how God has been dishonoured in and by our bodies. Thegroanings which cannot be uttered, are not hid from Him that searchesthe heart, and knows the mind of the Spirit. David, in his troubles,was a type of Christ in his agonies, of Christ on his cross, sufferingand deserted.
Psa 38:12-22	<br>Wicked men hate goodness, even when they benefit by it. David, in thecomplaints he makes of his enemies, seems to refer to Christ. But ourenemies do us real mischief only when they drive us from God and ourduty. The true believer's trouble will be made useful; he will learn towait for his God, and will not seek relief from the world or himself.The less we notice the unkindness and injuries that are done us, themore we consult the quiet of our own minds. David's troubles were thechastisement and the consequence of his transgressions, whilst Christsuffered for our sins and ours only. What right can a sinner have toyield to impatience or anger, when mercifully corrected for his sins?David was very sensible of the present workings of corruption in him.Good men, by setting their sorrow continually before them, have beenready to fall; but by setting God always before them, they have kepttheir standing. If we are truly penitent for sin, that will make uspatient under affliction. Nothing goes nearer to the heart of abeliever when in affliction, than to be under the apprehension of God'sdeserting him; nor does any thing come more feelingly from his heartthan this prayer, "Be not far from me." The Lord will hasten to helpthose who trust in him as their salvation.
Psa 39:1-6	<br>If an evil thought should arise in the mind, suppress it. Watchfulnessin the habit, is the bridle upon the head; watchfulness in acts, is thehand upon the bridle. When not able to separate from wicked men, weshould remember they will watch our words, and turn them, if they can,to our disadvantage. Sometimes it may be necessary to keep silence,even from good words; but in general we are wrong when backward toengage in edifying discourse. Impatience is a sin that has its causewithin ourselves, and that is, musing; and its ill effects uponourselves, and that is no less than burning. In our greatest health andprosperity, every man is altogether vanity, he cannot live long; he maydie soon. This is an undoubted truth, but we are very unwilling tobelieve it. Therefore let us pray that God would enlighten our minds byhis Holy Spirit, and fill our hearts with his grace, that we may beready for death every day and hour.
Psa 39:7-13	<br>There is no solid satisfaction to be had in the creature; but it is tobe found in the Lord, and in communion with him; to him we should bedriven by our disappointments. If the world be nothing but vanity, mayGod deliver us from having or seeking our portion in it. Whencreature-confidences fail, it is our comfort that we have a God to goto, a God to trust in. We may see a good God doing all, and orderingall events concerning us; and a good man, for that reason, says nothingagainst it. He desires the pardoning of his sin, and the preventing ofhis shame. We must both watch and pray against sin. When under thecorrecting hand of the Lord, we must look to God himself for relief,not to any other. Our ways and our doings bring us into trouble, and weare beaten with a rod of our own making. What a poor thing is beauty!and what fools are those that are proud of it, when it will certainly,and may quickly, be consumed! The body of man is as a garment to thesoul. In this garment sin has lodged a moth, which wears away, firstthe beauty, then the strength, and finally the substance of its parts.Whoever has watched the progress of a lingering distemper, or the workof time alone, in the human frame, will feel at once the force of thiscomparison, and that, surely every man is vanity. Afflictions are sentto stir up prayer. If they have that effect, we may hope that God willhear our prayer. The believer expects weariness and ill treatment onhis way to heaven; but he shall not stay here long : walking with Godby faith, he goes forward on his journey, not diverted from his course,nor cast down by the difficulties he meets. How blessed it is to sitloose from things here below, that while going home to our Father'shouse, we may use the world as not abusing it! May we always look forthat city, whose Builder and Maker is God.
Psa 40:1-5	<br>Doubts and fears about the eternal state, are a horrible pit and miryclay, and have been so to many a dear child of God. There is powerenough in God to help the weakest, and grace enough to help theunworthiest of all that trust in him. The psalmist waited patiently; hecontinued believing, hoping, and praying. This is applicable to Christ.His agony, in the garden and on the cross, was a horrible pit and miryclay. But those that wait patiently for God do not wait in vain. Thosethat have been under religious melancholy, and by the grace of God havebeen relieved, may apply 
Psa 40:2) very feelingly to themselves; theyare brought up out of a horrible pit. Christ is the Rock on which apoor soul can alone stand fast. Where God has given stedfast hope, heexpects there should be a steady, regular walk and conduct. God filledthe psalmist with joy, as well as peace in believing. Multitudes, byfaith beholding the sufferings and glory of Christ, have learned tofear the justice and trust in the mercy of God through Him. Many arethe benefits with which we are daily loaded, both by the providence andby the grace of God.	
Psa 40:6-10	<br>The psalmist foretells that work of wonder, redemption by our LordJesus Christ. The Substance must come, which is Christ, who must bringthat glory to God, and that grace to man, which it was impossible thesacrifices should ever do. Observe the setting apart of our Lord Jesusto the work and office of Mediator. In the volume, or roll, of the bookit was written of him. In the close rolls of the Divine decrees andcounsel, the covenant of redemption was recorded. Also, in all thevolumes of the Old Testament something was written of him, Joh 19:28.Now the purchase of our salvation is made, the proclamation is sentforth, calling us to come and accept it. It was preached freely andopenly. Whoever undertook to preach the gospel of Christ, would beunder great temptation to conceal it; but Christ, and those he calls tothat work, are carried on in it. May we believe his testimony, trusthis promise, and submit to his authority.
Psa 40:11-17	<br>The best saints see themselves undone, unless continually preserved bythe grace of God. But see the frightful view the psalmist had of sin.This made the discovery of a Redeemer so welcome. In all hisreflections upon each step of his life, he discovered something amiss.The sight and sense of our sins in their own colours, must distract us,if we have not at the same time some sight of a Saviour. If Christ hastriumphed over our spiritual enemies, then we, through him, shall bemore than conquerors. This may encourage all that seek God and love hissalvation, to rejoice in him, and to praise him. No griefs nor povertycan render those miserable who fear the Lord. Their God, and all thathe has or does, is the ground of their joy. The prayer of faith canunlock his fulness, which is adapted to all their wants. The promisesare sure, the moment of fulfilment hastens forward. He who once came ingreat humility, shall come again in glorious majesty.
Psa 41:1-4	<br>The people of God are not free from poverty, sickness, or outwardaffliction, but the Lord will consider their case, and send duesupplies. From his Lord's example the believer learns to consider hispoor and afflicted brethren. This branch of godliness is usuallyrecompensed with temporal blessings. But nothing is so distressing tothe contrite believer, as a fear or sense of the Divine displeasure, orof sin in his heart. Sin is the sickness of the soul; pardoning mercyheals it, renewing grace heals it, and for this spiritual healing weshould be more earnest than for bodily health.
Psa 41:5-13	<br>We complain, and justly, of the want of sincerity, and that there isscarcely any true friendship to be found among men; but the former dayswere no better. One particularly, in whom David had reposed greatconfidence, took part with his enemies. And let us not think itstrange, if we receive evil from those we suppose to be friends. Havenot we ourselves thus broken our words toward God? We eat of his breaddaily, yet lift up the heel against him. But though we may not takepleasure in the fall of our enemies, we may take pleasure in the makingvain their designs. When we can discern the Lord's favour in any mercy,personal or public, that doubles it. If the grace of God did not takeconstant care of us, we should not be upheld. But let us, while onearth, give heartfelt assent to those praises which the redeemed onearth and in heaven render to their God and Saviour.
Psa 42:1-5	<br>The psalmist looked to the Lord as his chief good, and set his heartupon him accordingly; casting anchor thus at first, he rides out thestorm. A gracious soul can take little satisfaction in God's courts, ifit do not meet with God himself there. Living souls never can take uptheir rest any where short of a living God. To appear before the Lordis the desire of the upright, as it is the dread of the hypocrite.Nothing is more grievous to a gracious soul, than what is intended toshake its confidence in the Lord. It was not the remembrance of thepleasures of his court that afflicted David; but the remembrance of thefree access he formerly had to God's house, and his pleasure inattending there. Those that commune much with their own hearts, willoften have to chide them. See the cure of sorrow. When the soul restson itself, it sinks; if it catches hold on the power and promise ofGod, the head is kept above the billows. And what is our support underpresent woes but this, that we shall have comfort in Him. We have greatcause to mourn for sin; but being cast down springs from unbelief and arebellious will; we should therefore strive and pray against it.
Psa 42:6-11	<br>The way to forget our miseries, is to remember the God of our mercies.David saw troubles coming from God's wrath, and that discouraged him.But if one trouble follow hard after another, if all seem to combinefor our ruin, let us remember they are all appointed and overruled bythe Lord. David regards the Divine favour as the fountain of all thegood he looked for. In the Saviour's name let us hope and pray. Oneword from him will calm every storm, and turn midnight darkness intothe light of noon, the bitterest complaints into joyful praises. Ourbelieving expectation of mercy must quicken our prayers for it. Atlength, is faith came off conqueror, by encouraging him to trust in thename of the Lord, and to stay himself upon his God. He adds, And myGod; this thought enabled him to triumph over all his griefs and fears.Let us never think that the God of our life, and the Rock of oursalvation, has forgotten us, if we have made his mercy, truth, andpower, our refuge. Thus the psalmist strove against his despondency: atlast his faith and hope obtained the victory. Let us learn to check allunbelieving doubts and fears. Apply the promise first to ourselves, andthen plead it to God.
Psa 44:1-8	<br>Former experiences of God's power and goodness are strong supports tofaith, and powerful pleas in prayer under present calamities. The manyvictories Israel obtained, were not by their own strength or merit, butby God's favour and free grace. The less praise this allows us, themore comfort it affords, that we may see all as coming from the favourof God. He fought for Israel, else they had fought in vain. This isapplicable to the planting of the Christian church in the world, whichwas not by any human policy or power. Christ, by his Spirit, went forthconquering and to conquer; and he that planted a church for himself inthe world, will support it by the same power and goodness. They trustedand triumphed in and through him. Let him that glories, glory in theLord. But if they have the comfort of his name, let them give unto himthe glory due unto it.
Psa 44:9-16	<br>The believer must have times of temptation, affliction, anddiscouragement; the church must have seasons of persecution. At suchtimes the people of God will be ready to fear that he has cast themoff, and that his name and truth will be dishonoured. But they shouldlook above the instruments of their trouble, to God, well knowing thattheir worst enemies have no power against them, but what is permittedfrom above.
Psa 44:17-26	<br>In afflictions, we must not seek relief by any sinful compliance; butshould continually meditate on the truth, purity, and knowledge of ourheart-searching God. Hearts sins and secret sins are known to God, andmust be reckoned for. He knows the secret of the heart, thereforejudges of the words and actions. While our troubles do not drive usfrom our duty to God, we should not suffer them to drive us from ourcomfort in God. Let us take care that prosperity and ease do not renderus careless and lukewarm. The church of God cannot be prevailed on bypersecution to forget God; the believer's heart does not turn back fromGod. The Spirit of prophecy had reference to those who suffered untodeath, for the testimony of Christ. Observe the pleas used, 
Psa 44:25,26). Not their own merit and righteousness, but the poor sinner'spleas. None that belong to Christ shall be cast off, but every one ofthem shall be saved, and that for ever. The mercy of God, purchased,promised, and constantly flowing forth, and offered to believers, doesaway every doubt arising from our sins; while we pray in faith, Redeemus for thy mercies' sake.	
Psa 45:1-5	<br>The psalmist's tongue was guided by the Spirit of God, as the pen is bythe hand of a ready writer. This psalm is touching the King Jesus, hiskingdom and government. It is a shame that this good matter is not morethe subject of our discourse. There is more in Christ to engage ourlove, than there is or can be in any creature. This world and itscharms are ready to draw away our hearts from Christ; therefore we areconcerned to understand how much more worthy he is of our love. By hisword, his promise, his gospel, the good will of God is made known tous, and the good work of God is begun and carried on in us. Thepsalmist, 
Psa 45:3-5), joyfully foretells the progress and success ofthe Messiah. The arrows of conviction are very terrible in the heartsof sinners, till they are humbled and reconciled; but the arrows ofvengeance will be more so to his enemies who refuse to submit. All whohave seen his glory and tasted his grace, rejoice to see him, by hisword and Spirit, bring enemies and strangers under his dominion.	
Psa 45:6-9	<br>The throne of this almighty King is established for ever. While theHoly Spirit leads Christ's people to look to his cross, he teaches themto see the evil of sin and the beauty of holiness; so that none of themcan feel encouragement to continue in sin. The Mediator is God, else hehad been neither able to do the Mediator's work, nor fit to wear theMediator's crown. God the Father, as his God in respect to his humannature and mediatorial offices, has given to him the Holy Spiritwithout measure. Thus anointed to be a Prophet, Priest, and King,Christ has pre-eminence in the gladdening gifts and graces of thespirit, and from his fulness communicates them to his brethren in humannature. The Spirit is called the oil of gladness, because of thedelight wherewith Christ was filled, in carrying on his undertakings.The salvation of sinners is the joy of angels, much more of the Son.And in proportion as we are conformed to his holy image, we may expectthe gladdening gifts influences of the Comforter. The excellences ofthe Messiah, the suitableness of his offices, and the sufficiency ofhis grace, seem to be intended by the fragrance of his garments. Thechurch formed of true believers, is here compared to the queen, whom,by an everlasting covenant, the Lord Jesus has betrothed to himself.This is the bride, the Lamb's wife, whose graces are compared to finelinen, for their purity; to gold, for their costliness: for as we oweour redemption, so we owe our adorning, to the precious blood of theSon of God.
Psa 45:10-17	<br>If we desire to share these blessings, we must hearken to Christ'sword. We must forget our carnal and sinful attachments and pursuits. Hemust be our Lord as well as our Saviour; all idols must be thrown away,that we may give him our whole heart. And here is good encouragement,thus to break off from former alliances. The beauty of holiness, bothon the church and on particular believers, is, in the sight of Christ,of great price, and very amiable. The work of grace is the workmanshipof the Spirit, it is the image of Christ upon the soul, a partaking ofthe Divine nature. It is clear of all sin, there is none in it, nor anycomes from it. There is nothing glorious in the old man or corruptnature; but in the new man, or work of grace upon the soul, every thingis glorious. The robe of Christ's righteousness, which he has wroughtout for his church, the Father imputes unto her, and bestows upon her.None are brought to Christ, but those whom the Father brings. Thisnotes the conversion of souls to him. The robe of righteousness, andgarments of salvation, the change of raiment Christ has put upon her.Such as strictly cleave to Christ, loving him in singleness of heart,are companions of the bride, who partake of the very same grace, enjoythe same privileges, and share in one common salvation. These, everyone, shall be brought to the King; not one lost or left behind. Insteadof the Old Testament church, there shall be a New Testament church, aGentile church. In the believing hope of our everlasting happiness inthe other world, let us always keep up the remembrance of Christ, asour only way thither; and transmit the remembrance of him to succeedinggenerations, that his name may endure for ever.
Psa 46:1-5	<br>This psalm encourages to hope and trust in God; in his power andprovidence, and his gracious presence with his church in the worst oftimes. We may apply it to spiritual enemies, and the encouragement wehave that, through Christ, we shall be conquerors over them. He is aHelp, a present Help, a Help found, one whom we have found to be so; aHelp at hand, one that is always near; we cannot desire a better, norshall we ever find the like in any creature. Let those be troubled atthe troubling of the waters, who build their confidence on a floatingfoundation; but let not those be alarmed who are led to the Rock, andthere find firm footing. Here is joy to the church, even in sorrowfultimes. The river alludes to the graces and consolations of the HolySpirit, which flow through every part of the church, and through God'ssacred ordinances, gladdening the heart of every believer. It ispromised that the church shall not be moved. If God be in our hearts,by his word dwelling richly in us, we shall be established, we shall behelped; let us trust and not be afraid.
Psa 46:6-11	<br>Come and see the effects of desolating judgments, and stand in awe ofGod. This shows the perfect security of the church, and is an assuranceof lasting peace. Let us pray for the speedy approach of these gloriousdays, and in silent submission let us worship and trust in our almightySovereign. Let all believers triumph in this, that the Lord of hosts,the God of Jacob, has been, is, and will be with us; and will be ourRefuge. Mark this, take the comfort, and say, If God be for us, who canbe against us? With this, through life and in death, let us answerevery fear.
Psa 47:1-4	<br>The God with whom we have to do, is a God of awful majesty. Theuniversal and absolute sovereignty of a holy God would be too terriblefor us even to think of, were it not exercised by his Son from amercy-seat; but now it is only terrible to the workers of iniquity.While his people express confidence and joy, and animate each other inserving him, let sinners submit to his authority, and accept hissalvation. Jesus Christ shall subdue the Gentiles; he shall bring themas sheep into the fold, not for slaughter, but for preservation. Heshall subdue their affections, and make them a willing people in theday of his power. Also it speaks of his giving them rest andsettlement. Apply this spiritually; the Lord himself has undertaken tobe the inheritance of his people. It shows the faith and submission ofthe saints. This is the language of every gracious soul, The Lord shallchoose my inheritance for me; he knows what is good for me better thanI do.
Psa 47:5-9	<br>Praise is a duty in which we ought to be frequent and abundant. Buthere is a needful rule; Sing ye praises with understanding. As thosethat understand why and for what reasons they praise God, and what isthe meaning of the service. It is not an acceptable service, if it isnot a reasonable service. We are never to forget the end of Messiah'sexaltation, so continually do the prophets dwell upon the conversion ofthe nations to the gospel of Christ. Why do we vainly fancy that webelong to him, unless the Spirit reign in our hearts by faith? Lord, isit not thy glory and delight to give repentance to Israel and remissionof sins, now that thou art exalted as a Prince and a Saviour? Set upthy kingdom in our hearts. Bring into captivity every thought to theobedience of Christ. And so sweetly constrain all the powers andfaculties of the souls of thy redeemed, into holy love, fear, anddelight in thee, that praise with the understanding may rise from everyheart, both here and for ever, to Thee, our God.
Psa 48:1-7	<br>Jerusalem is the city of our God: none on earth render him due honourexcept the citizens of the spiritual Jerusalem. Happy the kingdom, thecity, the family, the heart, in which God is great, in which he is all.There God is known. The clearer discoveries are made to us of the Lordand his greatness, the more it is expected that we should abound in hispraises. The earth is, by sin, covered with deformity, therefore justlymight that spot of ground, which was beautified with holiness, becalled the joy of the whole earth; that which the whole earth hasreason to rejoice in, that God would thus in very deed dwell with manupon the earth. The kings of the earth were afraid of it. Nothing innature can more fitly represent the overthrow of heathenism by theSpirit of the gospel, than the wreck of a fleet in a storm. Both are bythe mighty power of the Lord.
Psa 48:8-14	<br>We have here the improvement which the people of God are to make of hisglorious and gracious appearances for them. Let our faith in the wordof God be hereby confirmed. Let our hope of the stability of the churchbe encouraged. Let our minds be filled with good thoughts of God. Allthe streams of mercy that flow down to us, must be traced to thefountain of His loving-kindness. Let us give to God the glory of thegreat things he has done for us. Let all the members of the church takecomfort from what the Lord does for his church. Let us observe thebeauty, strength, and safety of the church. Consider its strength; seeit founded on Christ the Rock, fortified by the Divine power, guardedby Him who neither slumbers nor sleeps. See what precious ordinancesare its palaces, what precious promises are its bulwarks, that you maybe encouraged to join yourselves to it: and tell this to others. ThisGod, who has now done such great things for us, is unchangeable in hislove to us, and his care for us. If he is our God, he will lead andkeep us even to the last. He will so guide us, as to set us above thereach of death, so that it shall not do us any real hurt. He will leadus to a life in which there shall be no more death.
Psa 49:1-5	<br>We seldom meet with a more solemn introduction: there is no truth ofgreater importance. Let all hear this with application to ourselves.The poor are in danger from undue desire toward the wealth of theworld, as rich people from undue delight in it. The psalmist beginswith applying it to himself, and that is the right method in which totreat of Divine things. Before he sets down the folly of carnalsecurity, he lays down, from his own experience, the benefit andcomfort of a holy, gracious security, which they enjoy who trust inGod, and not in their worldly wealth. In the day of judgment, theiniquity of our heels, or of our steps, our past sins, will compass us.In those days, worldly, wicked people will be afraid; but whereforeshould a man fear death who has God with him?
Psa 49:6-14	<br>Here is a description of the spirit and way of worldly people. A manmay have wealth, and may have his heart enlarged in love, thankfulness,and obedience, and may do good with it. Therefore it is not men'shaving riches that proves them to be worldly, but their setting theirhearts upon them as the best things. Worldly men have only somefloating thoughts of the things of God, while their fixed thoughts,their inward thoughts, are about the world; that lies nearest theheart. But with all their wealth they cannot save the life of thedearest friend they have. This looks further, to the eternal redemptionto be wrought out by the Messiah. The redemption of the soul shall costvery dear; but, being once wrought, it shall never need to be repeated.And he, the Redeemer, shall rise again before he sees corruption, andthen shall live for evermore, Re 1:18. This likewise shows the folly ofworldly people, who sell their souls for that which will never buythem. With all their wealth they cannot secure themselves from thestroke of death. Yet one generation after another applaud their maxims;and the character of a fool, as drawn by heavenly Wisdom itself, Lu12:16-21, continues to be followed even among professed Christians.Death will ask the proud sinner, Where is thy wealth, thy pomp? And inthe morning of the resurrection, when all that sleep in the dust shallawake, the upright shall be advanced to the highest honour, when thewicked shall be filled with everlasting shame and contempt, Da 12:2.Let us now judge of things as they will appear in that day. The beautyof holiness is that alone which the grave cannot touch, or damage.
Psa 49:15-20	<br>Believers should not fear death. The distinction of men's outwardconditions, how great soever in life, makes none at death; but thedifference of men's spiritual states, though in this life it may seemof small account, yet at and after death is very great. The soul isoften put for the life. The God of life, who was its Creator at first,can and will be its Redeemer at last. It includes the salvation of thesoul from eternal ruin. Believers will be under strong temptation toenvy the prosperity of sinners. Men will praise thee, and cry thee up,as having done well for thyself in raising an estate and family. Butwhat will it avail to be approved of men, if God condemn us? Those thatare rich in the graces and comforts of the Spirit, have something ofwhich death cannot strip them, nay, which death will improve; but asfor worldly possessions, as we brought nothing into the world, so it iscertain that we shall carry nothing out; we must leave all to others.The sum of the whole matter is, that it can profit a man nothing togain the whole world, to become possessed of all its wealth and all itspower, if he lose his own soul, and is cast away for want of that holyand heavenly wisdom which distinguishes man from the brutes, in hislife and at his death. And are there men who can prefer the lot of therich sinner to that of poor Lazarus, in life and death, and toeternity? Assuredly there are. What need then we have of the teachingof the Holy Ghost; when, with all our boasted powers, we are prone tosuch folly in the most important of all concerns!
Psa 50:1-6	<br>This psalm is a psalm of instruction. It tells of the coming of Christand the day of judgment, in which God will call men to account; and theHoly Ghost is the Spirit of judgement. All the children of men areconcerned to know the right way of worshipping the Lord, in spirit andin truth. In the great day, our God shall come, and make those hear hisjudgement who would not hearken to his law. Happy are those who comeinto the covenant of grace, by faith in the Redeemer's atoningsacrifice, and show the sincerity of their love by fruits ofrighteousness. When God rejects the services of those who rest inoutside performances, he will graciously accept those who seek himaright. It is only by sacrifice, by Christ, the great Sacrifice, fromwhom the sacrifices of the law derived what value they had, that we canbe accepted of God. True and righteous are his judgments; even sinners'own consciences will be forced to acknowledge the righteousness of God.
Psa 50:7-15	<br>To obey is better than sacrifice, and to love God and our neighbourbetter than all burnt-offerings. We are here warned not to rest inthese performances. And let us beware of resting in any form. Goddemands the heart, and how can human inventions please him, whenrepentance, faith, and holiness are neglected? In the day of distresswe must apply to the Lord by fervent prayer. Our troubles, though wesee them coming from God's hand, must drive us to him, not drive usfrom him. We must acknowledge him in all our ways, depend upon hiswisdom, power, and goodness, and refer ourselves wholly to him, and sogive him glory. Thus must we keep up communion with God; meeting himwith prayers under trials, and with praises in deliverances. Abelieving supplicant shall not only be graciously answered as to hispetition, and so have cause for praising God, but shall also have graceto praise him.
Psa 50:16-23	<br>Hypocrisy is wickedness, which God will judge. And it is too common,for those who declare the Lord's statutes to others, to live indisobedience to them themselves. This delusion arises from the abuse ofGod's long-suffering, and a wilful mistake of his character and theintention of his gospel. The sins of sinners will be fully proved onthem in the judgment of the great day. The day is coming when God willset their sins in order, sins of childhood and youth, of riper age andold age, to their everlasting shame and terror. Let those hithertoforgetful of God, given up to wickedness, or in any way negligent ofsalvation, consider their urgent danger. The patience of the Lord isvery great. It is the more wonderful, because sinners make such ill useof it; but if they turn not, they shall be made to see their error whenit is too late. Those that forget God, forget themselves; and it willnever be right with them till they consider. Man's chief end is toglorify God: whoso offers praise, glorifies him, and his spiritualsacrifices shall be accepted. We must praise God, sacrifice praise, putit into the hands of the Priest, our Lord Jesus, who is also the altar:we must be fervent in spirit, praising the Lord. Let us thankfullyaccept God's mercy, and endeavour to glorify him in word and deed.
Psa 51:1-6	<br>David, being convinced of his sin, poured out his soul to God in prayerfor mercy and grace. Whither should backsliding children return, but tothe Lord their God, who alone can heal them? he drew up, by Divineteaching, an account of the workings of his heart toward God. Thosethat truly repent of their sins, will not be ashamed to own theirrepentance. Also, he instructs others what to do, and what to say.David had not only done much, but suffered much in the cause of God;yet he flees to God's infinite mercy, and depends upon that alone forpardon and peace. He begs the pardon of sin. The blood of Christ,sprinkled upon the conscience, blots out the transgression, and, havingreconciled us to God, reconciles us to ourselves. The believer longs tohave the whole debt of his sins blotted out, and every stain cleansed;he would be thoroughly washed from all his sins; but the hypocritealways has some secret reserve, and would have some favorite lustspared. David had such a deep sense of his sin, that he was continuallythinking of it, with sorrow and shame. His sin was committed againstGod, whose truth we deny by wilful sin; with him we deal deceitfully.And the truly penitent will ever trace back the streams of actual sinto the fountain of original depravity. He confesses his originalcorruption. This is that foolishness which is bound in the heart of achild, that proneness to evil, and that backwardness to good, which isthe burden of the regenerate, and the ruin of the unregenerate. He isencouraged, in his repentance, to hope that God would graciously accepthim. Thou desirest truth in the inward part; to this God looks, in areturning sinner. Where there is truth, God will give wisdom. Those whosincerely endeavour to do their duty shall be taught their duty; butthey will expect good only from Divine grace overcoming their corruptnature.
Psa 51:7-15	<br>Purge me with hyssop, with the blood of Christ applied to my soul by alively faith, as the water of purification was sprinkled with a bunchof hyssop. The blood of Christ is called the blood of sprinkling, Heb12:24. If this blood of Christ, which cleanses from all sin, cleanse usfrom our sin, then we shall be clean indeed, Heb 10:2. He asks not tobe comforted, till he is first cleansed; if sin, the bitter root ofsorrow, be taken away, he can pray in faith, Let me have awell-grounded peace, of thy creating, so that the bones broken byconvictions may rejoice, may be comforted. Hide thy face from my sins;blot out all mine iniquities out of thy book; blot them out, as a cloudis blotted out and dispelled by the beams of the sun. And the believerdesires renewal to holiness as much as the joy of salvation. David nowsaw, more than ever, what an unclean heart he had, and sadly lamentsit; but he sees it is not in his own power to amend it, and thereforebegs God would create in him a clean heart. When the sinner feels thischange is necessary, and reads the promise of God to that purpose, hebegins to ask it. He knew he had by his sin grieved the Holy Spirit,and provoked him to withdraw. This he dreads more than anything. Heprays that Divine comforts may be restored to him. When we giveourselves cause to doubt our interest in salvation, how can we expectthe joy of it? This had made him weak; he prays, I am ready to fall,either into sin or into despair, therefore uphold me with thy Spirit.Thy Spirit is a free Spirit, a free Agent himself, working freely. Andthe more cheerful we are in our duty, the more constant we shall be toit. What is this but the liberty wherewith Christ makes his peoplefree, which is contrasted with the yoke of bondage? Ga 5:1. It is theSpirit of adoption spoken to the heart. Those to whom God is the God ofsalvation, he will deliver from guilt; for the salvation he is the Godof, is salvation from sin. We may therefore plead with him, Lord, thouart the God of my salvation, therefore deliver me from the dominion ofsin. And when the lips are opened, what should they speak but thepraises of God for his forgiving mercy?
Psa 51:16-19	<br>Those who are thoroughly convinced of their misery and danger by sin,would spare no cost to obtain the remission of it. But as they cannotmake satisfaction for sin, so God cannot take any satisfaction in them,otherwise than as expressing love and duty to him. The good workwrought in every true penitent, is a broken spirit, a broken and acontrite heart, and sorrow for sin. It is a heart that is tender, andpliable to God's word. Oh that there were such a heart in every one ofus! God is graciously pleased to accept this; it is instead of allburnt-offering and sacrifice. The broken heart is acceptable to Godonly through Jesus Christ; there is no true repentance without faith inhim. Men despise that which is broken, but God will not. He will notoverlook it, he will not refuse or reject it; though it makes God nosatisfaction for the wrong done to him by sin. Those who have been inspiritual troubles, know how to pity and pray for others afflicted inlike manner. David was afraid lest his sin should bring judgements uponthe city and kingdom. No personal fears or troubles of conscience canmake the soul, which has received grace, careless about the interestsof the church of God. And let this be the continued joy of all theredeemed, that they have redemption through the blood of Christ, theforgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace.
Psa 52:1-5	<br>Those that glory in sin, glory in their shame. The patience andforbearance of God are abused by sinners, to the hardening of theirhearts in their wicked ways. But the enemies in vain boast in theirmischief, while we have God's mercy to trust in. It will not save usfrom the guilt of lying, to be able to say, there was some truth inwhat we said, if we make it appear otherwise than it was. The morethere is of craft and contrivance in any wickedness, the more there isof Satan in it. When good men die, they are transplanted from the landof the living on earth, to heaven, the garden of the Lord, where theyshall take root for ever; but when wicked men die, they are rooted out,to perish for ever. The believer sees that God will destroy those whomake not him their strength.
Psa 52:6-9	<br>Those wretchedly deceive themselves, who think to support themselves inpower and wealth without God. The wicked man trusted in the abundanceof his riches; he thought his wickedness would help him to keep hiswealth. Right or wrong, he would get what he could, and keep what hehad, and ruin any one that stood in his way; this he thought wouldstrengthen him; but see what it comes to! Those who by faith and lovedwell in the house of God, shall be like green olive-trees there. Andthat we may be as green olive-trees, we must live a life of faith andholy confidence in God and his grace. It adds much to the beauty of ourprofession, and to fruitfulness in every grace, to be much in praisingGod; and we never can want matter for praise. His name alone can be ourrefuge and strong tower. It is very good for us to wait on that savingname; there is nothing better to calm and quiet our spirits, whendisturbed, and to keep us in the way of duty, when tempted to use anycrooked courses for our relief, than to hope, and quietly wait for thesalvation of the Lord. None ever followed his guidance but it endedwell.
Psa 54:1-3	<br>God is faithful, though men are not to be trusted, and it is well forus it is so. David has no other plea to depend upon than God's name, noother power to depend upon than God's strength, and these he makes hisrefuge and confidence. This would be the effectual answer to hisprayers. Looking unto David, betrayed by the men of Judah, and toJesus, betrayed by one of his apostles, what can we expect from any whohave not set God before them, save ingratitude, treachery, malice, andcruelty? What bonds of nature, or friendship, or gratitude, orcovenant, will hold those that have broken through the fear of God?Selah; Mark this. Let us set God before us at all times; for if we donot, we are in danger of despair.
Psa 54:4-7	<br>Behold, God is mine Helper. If we are for him, he is for us; and if heis for us, we need not fear. Every creature is that to us, and no more,which God makes it to be. The Lord will in due time save his people,and in the mean time he sustains them, and bears them up, so that thespirit he has made shall not fail. There is truth in God'sthreatenings, as well as in his promises; sinners that repent not, willfind it so to their cost. David's present deliverance was an earnest offurther deliverance. He speaks of the completion of his deliverance asa thing done, though he had as yet many troubles before him; because,having God's promise for it, he was as sure of it as if it was donealready. The Lord would deliver him out of all his troubles. May hehelp us to bear our cross without repining, and at length bring us toshare his victories and glory. Christians never should suffer the voiceof praise and thanksgiving to cease in the church of the redeemed.
Psa 55:1-8	<br>In these verses we have, 1. David praying. Prayer is a salve for everysore, and a relief to the spirit under every burden. 2. David weeping.Griefs are thus, in some measure, lessened, while those increase thathave no vent given them. David in great alarm. We may well suppose himto be so, upon the breaking out of Absalom's conspiracy, and thefalling away of the people. Horror overwhelmed him. Probably theremembrance of his sin in the matter of Uriah added much to the terror.When under a guilty conscience we must mourn in our complaint, and evenstrong believers have for a time been filled with horror. But none everwas so overwhelmed as the holy Jesus, when it pleased the Lord to puthim to grief, and to make his soul an offering for our sins. In hisagony he prayed more earnestly, and was heard and delivered; trustingin him, and following him, we shall be supported under, and carriedthrough all trials. See how David was weary of the treachery andingratitude of men, and the cares and disappointments of his highstation: he longed to hide himself in some desert from the fury andfickleness of his people. He aimed not at victory, but rest; a barrenwilderness, so that he might be quiet. The wisest and best of men mostearnestly covet peace and quietness, and the more when vexed andwearied with noise and clamour. This makes death desirable to a childof God, that it is a final escape from all the storms and tempests ofthis world, to perfect and everlasting rest.
Psa 55:9-15	<br>No wickedness so distresses the believer, as that which he witnesses inthose who profess to be of the church of God. Let us not be surprisedat the corruptions and disorders of the church on earth, but long tosee the New Jerusalem. He complains of one that had been veryindustrious against him. God often destroys the enemies of the churchby dividing them. And an interest divided against itself cannot longstand. The true Christian must expect trials from professed friends,from those with whom he has been united; this will be very painful; butby looking unto Jesus we shall be enabled to bear it. Christ wasbetrayed by a companion, a disciple, an apostle, who resembledAhithophel in his crimes and doom. Both were speedily overtaken byDivine vengeance. And this prayer is a prophecy of the utter, theeverlasting ruin, of all who oppose and rebel against the Messiah.
Psa 55:16-23	<br>In every trial let us call upon the Lord, and he will save us. He shallhear us, and not blame us for coming too often; the oftener the morewelcome. David had thought all were against him; but now he sees therewere many with him, more than he supposed; and the glory of this hegives to God, for it is he that raises us up friends, and makes themfaithful to us. There are more true Christians, and believers have morereal friends, than in their gloomy hours they suppose. His enemiesshould be reckoned with, and brought down; they could not easethemselves of their fears, as David could, by faith in God. Mortal men,though ever so high and strong, will easily be crushed by an eternalGod. Those who are not reclaimed by the rod of affliction, willcertainly be brought down to the pit of destruction. The burden ofafflictions is very heavy, especially when attended with thetemptations of Satan; there is also the burden of sin and corruption.The only relief under it is, to look to Christ, who bore it. Whateverit is that thou desirest God should give thee, leave it to him to giveit in his own way and time. Care is a burden, it makes the heart stoop.We must commit our ways and works to the Lord; let him do as seemethhim good, and let us be satisfied. To cast our burden upon God, is torest upon his providence and promise. And if we do so, he will carry usin the arms of his power, as a nurse carries a child; and willstrengthen our spirits by his Spirit, so that they shall sustain thetrial. He will never suffer the righteous to be moved; to be so shakenby any troubles, as to quit their duty to God, or their comfort in him.He will not suffer them to be utterly cast down. He, who bore theburden of our sorrows, desires us to leave to him to bear the burden ofour cares, that, as he knows what is best for us, he may provide itaccordingly. Why do not we trust Christ to govern the world which heredeemed?
Psa 56:1-7	<br>Be merciful unto me, O God. This petition includes all the good forwhich we come to throne of grace. If we obtain mercy there, we need nomore to make us happy. It implies likewise our best plea, not ourmerit, but God's mercy, his free, rich mercy. We may flee to, and trustthe mercy of God, when surrounded on all sides by difficulties anddangers. His enemies were too hard for him, if God did not help him. Heresolves to make God's promises the matter of his praises, and so wehave reason to make them. As we must not trust an arm of flesh whenengaged for us, so we must not be afraid of an arm of flesh whenstretched out against us. The sin of sinners will never be theirsecurity. Who knows the power of God's anger; how high it can reach,how forcibly it can strike?
Psa 56:8-13	<br>The heavy and continued trials through which many of the Lord's peoplehave passed, should teach us to be silent and patient under lightercrosses. Yet we are often tempted to repine and despond under smallsorrows. For this we should check ourselves. David comforts himself, inhis distress and fear, that God noticed all his grievances and all hisgriefs. God has a bottle and a book for his people's tears, both thetears for their sins, and those for their afflictions. He observes themwith tender concern. Every true believer may boldly say, The Lord is myhelper, and then I will not fear what man shall do unto me; for man hasno power but what is given him from above. Thy vows are upon me, OLord; not as a burden, but as that by which I am known to be thyservant; as a bridle that restrains me from what would be hurtful, anddirects me in the way of my duty. And vows of thankfulness properlyaccompany prayers for mercy. If God deliver us from sin, either fromdoing it, or by his pardoning mercy, he has delivered our souls fromdeath, which is the wages of sin. Where the Lord has begun a good workhe will carry it on and perfect it. David hopes that God would keep himeven from the appearance of sin. We should aim in all our desires andexpectations of deliverance, both from sin and trouble, that we may dothe better service to the Lord; that we may serve him without fear. Ifhis grace has delivered our souls from the death of sin, he will bringus to heaven, to walk before him for ever in light.
Psa 57:1-6	<br>All David's dependence is upon God. The most eminent believers needoften repeat the publican's prayer, "God be merciful to me a sinner."But if our souls trust in the Lord, this may assure us, in our utmostdangers, that our calamities will at length be overpast, and in themean time, by faith and prayer, we must make him our refuge. Though Godbe most high, yet he condescends so low, as to take care that allthings are made to work for good to his people. This is a good reasonwhy we should pray earnestly. Look which way we will on this earth,refuge fails, no help appears; but we may look for it from heaven. Ifwe have fled from the wrath to come, unto Jesus Christ, he thatperformed all things needful to purchase the salvation of his people,will do for us and in us all things needful for our enjoyment of it. Itmade David droop to think there should be those that bore him so muchill-will. But the mischief they designed against him, returned onthemselves. And when David was in the greatest distress and disgrace,he did not pray, Lord, exalt me, but, Lord, exalt thine own name. Ourbest encouragement in prayer, is taken from the glory of God, and tothat, more than to our own comfort, we should have regard in all ourpetitions for mercy.
Psa 57:7-11	<br>By lively faith, David's prayers and complaints are at once turned intopraises. His heart is fixed; it is prepared for every event, beingstayed upon God. If by the grace of God we are brought into this even,composed frame of mind, we have great reason to be thankful. Nothing isdone to purpose, in religion, unless it is done with the heart. Theheart must be fixed for the duty, put in frame for it; fixed in theduty by close attention. Our tongue is our glory, and never more sothan when praising God; dull and sleepy devotions will never beacceptable to God. Let us awake early in the morning, to begin the daywith God; early in the beginning of a mercy. When God comes toward uswith his favours, let us go forth to meet him with our praises. Daviddesired to bring others to join in praising God; and in his psalms, heis still praising God among the people, singing to Him among thenations. Let us seek to have our hearts fixed to praise his boundlessmercy and unfailing faithfulness; and to glorify him with body, soul,and spirit, which are his. Let us earnestly pray that the blessings ofthe gospel may be sent through every land.
Psa 58:1-5	<br>When wrong is done under the form of law, it is worse than any other;especially it is grievous to behold those who profess to be children ofGod, joining together against any of his people. We should thank theLord for merciful restraints; we should be more earnest in seekingrenewing grace, more watchful over ourselves, and more patient underthe effects of fallen nature in others. The corruption of their naturewas the root of bitterness. We may see in children the wickedness ofthe world beginning. They go astray from God and their duty as soon aspossibly they can. And how soon will little children tell lies! It isour duty to take pains to teach them, and above all, earnestly to prayfor converting grace to make our children new creatures. Though thepoison be within, much of it may be kept from breaking forth to injureothers. When the Saviour's words are duly regarded, the serpent becomesharmless. But those who refuse to hear heavenly wisdom, must perishmiserably, for ever.
Psa 58:6-11	<br>David prayed that the enemies of God's church and people might bedisabled to do further mischief. We may, in faith, pray against thedesigns of the enemies of the church. He foretells their ruin. And whoknows the power of God's anger? The victories of the Just One, in hisown person and that of his servants, over the enemies of man'ssalvation, produce a joy which springs not from revenge, but from aview of the Divine mercy, justice, and truth, shown in the redemptionof the elect, the punishment of the ungodly, and the fulfilment of thepromises. Whoever duly considers these things, will diligently seek thereward of righteousness, and adore the Providence which orders allthing aright in heaven and in earth.
Psa 59:1-7	<br>In these words we hear the voice of David when a prisoner in his ownhouse; the voice of Christ when surrounded by his merciless enemies;the voice of the church when under bondage in the world; and the voiceof the Christian when under temptation, affliction, and persecution.And thus earnestly should we pray daily, to be defended and deliveredfrom our spiritual enemies, the temptations of Satan, and thecorruptions of our own hearts. We should fear suffering as evil-doers,but not be ashamed of the hatred of workers of iniquity. It is notstrange, if those regard not what they themselves say, who have madethemselves believe that God regards not what they say. And where thereis no fear of God, there is nothing to secure proper regard to man.
Psa 59:8-17	<br>It is our wisdom and duty, in times of danger and difficulty, to waitupon God; for he is our defence, in whom we shall be safe. It is verycomfortable to us, in prayer, to look to God as the God of our mercy,the Author of all good in us, and the Giver of all good to us. Thewicked can never be satisfied, which is the greatest misery in a poorcondition. A contented man, if he has not what he would have, yet hedoes not quarrel with Providence, nor fret within himself. It is notpoverty, but discontent that makes a man unhappy. David would praiseGod because he had many times, and all along, found Him his refuge inthe day of trouble. He that is all this to us, is certainly worthy ofour best affections, praises, and services. The trials of his peoplewill end in joy and praise. When the night of affliction is over, theywill sing of the Lord's power and mercy in the morning. Let believersnow, in assured faith and hope, praise Him for those mercies, for whichthey will rejoice and praise him for ever.
Psa 60:1-5	<br>David owns God's displeasure to be the cause of all the hardships hehad undergone. And when God is turning his hand in our favour, it isgood to remember our former troubles. In God's displeasure theirtroubles began, therefore in his favour their prosperity must begin.Those breaches and divisions which the folly and corruption of manmake, nothing but the wisdom and grace of God can repair, by pouringout a spirit of love and peace, by which only a kingdom is saved fromruin. The anger of God against sin, is the only cause of all misery,private or public, that has been, is, or shall be. In all these casesthere is no remedy, but by returning to the Lord with repentance,faith, and prayer; beseeching him to return to us. Christ, the Son ofDavid, is given for a banner to those that fear God; in him they aregathered together in one, and take courage. In his name and strengththey wage war with the powers of darkness.
Psa 60:6-12	<br>If Christ be ours, all things, one way or another, shall be for oureternal good. The man who is a new creature in Christ, may rejoice inall the precious promises God has spoken in his holiness. His presentprivileges, and the sanctifying influences of the Spirit, are sureearnests of heavenly glory. David rejoices in conquering theneighbouring nations, which had been enemies to Israel. The Israel ofGod are through Christ more than conquerors. Though sometimes theythink that the Lord has cast them off, yet he will bring them into thestrong city at last. Faith in the promise will assure us that it is ourFather's good pleasure to give us the kingdom: But we are not yet madecomplete conquerors, and no true believer will abuse these truths toindulge sloth, or vain confidence. Hope in God is the best principle oftrue courage, for what need those fear who have God on their side? Allour victories are from him, and while those who willingly submit to ouranointed King shall share his glories, all his foes shall be put underhis feet.
Psa 61:1-4	<br>David begins with prayers and tears, but ends with praise. Thus thesoul, being lifted up to God, returns to the enjoyment of itself.Wherever we are, we have liberty to draw near to God, and may find away open to the throne of grace. And that which separates us from othercomforts, should drive us nearer to God, the fountain of all comfort.Though the heart is overwhelmed, yet it may be lifted up to God inprayer. Nay, I will cry unto thee, for by that means it will besupported and relieved. Weeping must quicken praying, and not deadenit. God's power and promise are a rock that is higher than we are. Thisrock is Christ. On the Divine mercy, as on a rock, David desired torest his soul; but he was like a ship-wrecked sailor, exposed to thebillows at the bottom of a rock too high for him to climb without help.David found that he could not be fixed on the Rock of salvation, unlessthe Lord placed him upon it. As there is safety in Him, and none inourselves, let us pray to be led to and fixed upon Christ our Rock. Theservice of God shall be his constant work and business: all must makeit so who expect to find God their shelter and strong tower. The graceof God shall be his constant comfort.
Psa 61:5-8	<br>There is a people in the world that fear God's name. There is aheritage peculiar to that people; present comforts in the soul,earnests of future bliss. Those that fear God have enough in him, andmust not complain. We need desire no better heritage than that of thosewho fear God. Those abide to good purpose in this world, who abidebefore God, serve him, and walk in his fear; those who do so, shallabide before him for ever. And these words are to be applied to Him ofwhom the angel said, the Lord shall give unto him the throne of hisfather David, and of his kingdom there shall be no end, Lu 1:32. God'spromises, and our faith in them, are not to do away, but to encourageprayer. We need not desire to be better secured than under theprotection of God's mercy and truth. And if we partake of that graceand truth which came by Jesus Christ, we may praise him, whatever beour outward circumstances. But renewed experience of God's mercy andtruth towards his people in Christ, is the main matter of our joy inhim, and our praise unto him.
Psa 62:1-7	<br>We are in the way both of duty and comfort, when our souls wait uponGod; when we cheerfully give up ourselves, and all our affairs, to hiswill and wisdom; when we leave ourselves to all the ways of hisprovidence, and patiently expect the event, with full satisfaction inhis goodness. See the ground and reason of this dependence. By hisgrace he has supported me, and by his providence delivered me. He onlycan be my Rock and my salvation; creatures are nothing without him,therefore I will look above them to him. Trusting in God, the heart isfixed. If God be for us, we need not fear what man can do against us.David having put his confidence in God, foresees the overthrow of hisenemies. We have found it good to wait upon the Lord, and should chargeour souls to have such constant dependence upon him, as may make usalways easy. If God will save my soul, I may well leave every thingelse to his disposal, knowing all shall turn to my salvation. And asDavid's faith in God advances to an unshaken stedfastness, so his joyin God improves into a holy triumph. Meditation and prayer are blessedmeans of strengthening faith and hope.
Psa 62:8-12	<br>Those who have found the comfort of the ways of God themselves, willinvite others into those ways; we shall never have the less for otherssharing with us. the good counsel given is, to trust wholly in God. Wemust so trust in him at all times, as not at any time to put that trustin ourselves, or in any creature, which is to be put in him only. Trustin him to guide us when in doubt, to protect us when in danger, tosupply us when in want, to strengthen us for every good word and work.We must lay out wants and our wishes before him, and then patientlysubmit our wills to his: this is pouring out our hearts. God is arefuge for all, even for as many as will take shelter in him. Thepsalmist warns against trusting in men. The multitude, those of lowdegree, are changeable as the wind. The rich and noble seem to havemuch in their power, and lavish promises; but those that depend onthem, are disappointed. Weighed in the balance of Scripture, all thatman can do to make us happy is lighter than vanity itself. It is hardto have riches, and not to trust in them if they increase, though bylawful and honest means; but we must take heed, lest we set ouraffections unduly upon them. A smiling world is the most likely to drawthe heart from God, on whom alone it should be set. The consistentbeliever receives all from God as a trust; and he seeks to use it tohis glory, as a steward who must render an account. God hath spoken asit were once for all, that power belongs to him alone. He can punishand destroy. Mercy also belongs to him; and his recompensing theimperfect services of those that believe in him, blotting out theirtransgressions for the Redeemer's sake, is a proof of abundant mercy,and encourages us to trust in him. Let us trust in his mercy and grace,and abound in his work, expecting mercies from him alone.
Psa 63:1,2	<br>Early will I seek thee. The true Christian devotes to God the morninghour. He opens the eyes of his understanding with those of his body,and awakes each morning to righteousness. He arises with a thirst afterthose comforts which the world cannot give, and has immediate recourseby prayer to the Fountain of the water of life. The true believer isconvinced, that nothing in this sinful world can satisfy the wants anddesires of his immortal soul; he expects his happiness from God, as hisportion. When faith and hope are most in exercise, the world appears aweary desert, and the believer longs for the joys of heaven, of whichhe has some foretastes in the ordinances of God upon earth.
Psa 63:3-6	<br>Even in affliction we need not want matter for praise. When this is theregular frame of a believer's mind, he values the loving-kindness ofGod more than life. God's loving-kindness is our spiritual life, andthat is better than temporal life. We must praise God with joyful lips;we must address ourselves to the duties of religion with cheerfulness,and speak forth the praises of God from a principle of holy joy.Praising lips must be joyful lips. David was in continual danger; careand fear held his eyes waking, and gave him wearisome nights; but hecomforted himself with thoughts of God. The mercies of God, when calledto mind in the night watches, support the soul, making darknesscheerful. How happy will be that last morning, when the believer,awaking up after the Divine likeness, shall be satisfied with all thefulness of God, and praise him with joyful lips, where there is nonight, and where sorrow and sighing flee away!
Psa 63:7-11	<br>True Christians can, in some measure, and at some times, make use ofthe strong language of David, but too commonly our souls cleave to thedust. Having committed ourselves to God, we must be easy and pleased,and quiet from the fear of evil. Those that follow hard after God,would soon fail, if God's right hand did not uphold them. It is he thatstrengthens us and comforts us. The psalmist doubts not but that thoughnow sowing in tears, he should reap in joy. Messiah the Prince shallrejoice in God; he is already entered into the joy set before him, andhis glory will be completed at his second coming. Blessed Lord, let ourdesire towards thee increase every hour; let our love be always uponthee; let all our enjoyment be in thee, and all our satisfaction fromthee. Be thou all in all to us while we remain in the presentwilderness state, and bring us home to the everlasting enjoyment ofthee for ever.
Psa 64:1-6	<br>The psalmist earnestly begs of God to preserve him from disquietingfear. The tongue is a little member, but it boasts great things. Theupright man is the mark at which the wicked aim, they cannot speakpeaceably either of him or to him. There is no guard against a falsetongue. It is bad to do wrong, but worse to encourage ourselves and oneanother in it. It is a sign that the heart is hardened to the greatestdegree, when it is thus fully set to do evil. A practical disbelief ofGod's knowledge of all things, is at the bottom of every wickedness.The benefit of a good cause and a good conscience, appears most whennothing can help a man against his enemies, save God alone, who isalways a present help.
Psa 64:7-10	<br>When God brings upon men the mischiefs they have desired on others, itis weight enough to sink a man to the lowest hell. Those who lovecursing, it shall come upon them. Those who behold this shallunderstand, and observe God's hand in all; unless we do so, we are notlikely to profit by the dispensations of Providence. The righteousshall be glad in the Lord; not glad of the misery and ruin of theirfellow-creatures, but glad that God is glorified, and his wordfulfilled, and the cause of injured innocence pleaded effectually. Theyrejoice not in men, nor in themselves, nor in any creature, or creatureenjoyments, nor in their wisdom, strength, riches, or righteousness;but in Christ, in whom all the seed of Israel are justified and glory,and in what he is to them, and has done for them.
Psa 65:1-5	<br>All the praise the Lord receives from this earth is from Zion, beingthe fruit of the Spirit of Christ, and acceptable through him. Praiseis silent unto thee, as wanting words to express the great goodness ofGod. He reveals himself upon a mercy-seat, ready to hear and answer theprayers of all who come unto him by faith in Jesus Christ. Our sinsprevail against us; we cannot pretend to balance them with anyrighteousness of our own: yet, as for our transgressions, of thine ownfree mercy, and for the sake of a righteousness of thine own providing,we shall not come into condemnation for them. Observe what it is tocome into communion with God in order to blessedness. It is to conversewith him as one we love and value; it is to apply ourselves closely toreligion as to the business of our dwelling-place. Observe how we comeinto communion with God; only by God's free choice. There is abundanceof goodness in God's house, and what is satisfying to the soul; thereis enough for all, enough for each: it is always ready; and all withoutmoney and without price. By faith and prayer we may keep up communionwith God, and bring in comfort from him, wherever we are. But it isonly through that blessed One, who approaches the Father as ourAdvocate and Surety, that sinners may expect or can find thishappiness.
Psa 65:6-13	<br>That Almighty strength which sets fast the mountains, upholds thebeliever. That word which stills the stormy ocean, and speaks it into acalm, can silence our enemies. How contrary soever light and darknessare to each other, it is hard to say which is most welcome. Does thewatchman wait for the morning? so does the labourer earnestly desirethe shades of evening. Some understand it of the morning and eveningsacrifices. We are to look upon daily worship, both alone and with ourfamilies, to be the most needful of our daily occupations, the mostdelightful of our daily comforts. How much the fruitfulness of thislower part of the creation depends upon the influence of the upper, iseasy to observe; every good and perfect gift is from above. He whoenriches the earth, which is filled with man's sins, by his abundantand varied bounty, can neither want power nor will to feed the souls ofhis people. Temporal mercies to us unworthy creatures, shadow forthmore important blessings. The rising of the Sun of righteousness, andthe pouring forth of the influences of the Holy Spirit, that river ofGod, full of the waters of life and salvation, render the hard, barren,worthless hearts of sinners fruitful in every good work, and change theface of nations more than the sun and rain change the face of nature.Wherever the Lord passes, by his preached gospel, attended by his HolySpirit, his paths drop fatness, and numbers are taught to rejoice inand praise him. They will descend upon the pastures of the wilderness,all the earth shall hear and embrace the gospel, and bring forthabundantly the fruits of righteousness which are, through Jesus Christ,to the glory of the Father. Manifold and marvellous, O Lord, are thyworks, whether of nature or of grace; surely in loving-kindness hastthou made them all.
Psa 66:1-7	<br>The holy church throughout all the world lifts up her voice, to laudthat Name which is above every name, to make the praise of Jesusglorious, both by word and deed; that others may be led to glorify himalso. But nothing can bring men to do this aright, unless his effectualgrace create their hearts anew unto holiness; and in the redemption bythe death of Christ, and the glorious deliverances it effects, are morewondrous works than Israel's deliverance from Egyptian bondage.
Psa 66:8-12	<br>The Lord not only preserves our temporal life, but maintains thespiritual life which he has given to believers. By afflictions we areproved, as silver in the fire. The troubles of the church willcertainly end well. Through various conflicts and troubles, the slaveof Satan escapes from his yoke, and obtains joy and peace in believing:through much tribulation the believer must enter into the kingdom ofGod.
Psa 66:13-20	<br>We should declare unto those that fear God, what he has done for oursouls, and how he has heard and answered our prayers, inviting them tojoin us in prayer and praise; this will turn to our mutual comfort, andto the glory of God. We cannot share these spiritual privileges, if weretain the love of sin in our hearts, though we refrain from the grosspractice, Sin, regarded in the heart, will spoil the comfort andsuccess of prayer; for the sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination ofthe Lord. But if the feeling of sin in the heart causes desires to berid of it; if it be the presence of one urging a demand we know we mustnot, cannot comply with, this is an argument of sincerity. And when wepray in simplicity and godly sincerity, our prayers will be answered.This will excite gratitude to Him who hath not turned away our prayernor his mercy from us. It was not prayer that fetched the deliverance,but his mercy that sent it. That is the foundation of our hopes, thefountain of our comforts; and ought to be the matter of our praises.
Psa 68:1-6	<br>None ever hardened his heart against God, and prospered. God is the joyof his people, then let them rejoice when they come before him. He whoderives his being from none, but gives being to all, is engaged bypromise and covenant to bless his people. He is to be praised as a Godof mercy and tender compassion. He ever careth for the afflicted andoppressed: repenting sinners, who are helpless and exposed more thanany fatherless children, are admitted into his family, and share alltheir blessings.
Psa 68:7-14	<br>Fresh mercies should put us in mind of former mercies. If God bring hispeople into a wilderness, he will be sure to go before them in it, andto bring them out of it. He provided for them, both in the wildernessand in Canaan. The daily manna seems here meant. And it looks to thespiritual provision for God's Israel. The Spirit of grace and thegospel of grace are the plentiful rain, with which God confirms hisinheritance, and from which their fruit is found. Christ shall come asshowers that water the earth. The account of Israel's victories is tobe applied to the victories over death and hell, by the exaltedRedeemer, for those that are his. Israel in Egypt among the kilnsappeared wretched, but possessed of Canaan, during the reigns of Davidand Solomon, appeared glorious. Thus the slaves of Satan, whenconverted to Christ, when justified and sanctified by him, lookhonourable. When they reach heaven, all remains of their sinful statedisappear, they shall be as the wings of the dove, covered with silver,and her feathers as gold. Full salvation will render those white assnow, who were vile and loathsome through the guilt and defilement ofsin.
Psa 68:15-21	<br>The ascension of Christ must here be meant, and thereto it is applied,Eph 4:8. He received as the purchase of his death, the gifts needfulfor the conversion of sinners, and the salvation of believers. These hecontinually bestows, even on rebellious men, that the Lord God mightdwell among them, as their Friend and Father. He gave gifts to men.Having received power to give eternal life, the Lord Jesus bestows iton as many as were given him, Joh 17:2. Christ came to a rebelliousworld, not to condemn it, but that through him it might be saved. Theglory of Zion's King is, that he is a Saviour and Benefactor to all hiswilling people, and a consuming fire to all that persist in rebellionagainst him. So many, so weighty are the gifts of God's bounty, that hemay be truly said to load us with them. He will not put us off withpresent things for a portion, but will be the God of our salvation. TheLord Jesus has authority and power to rescue his people from thedominion of death, by taking away the sting of it from them when theydie, and giving them complete victory over it when they rise again. Thecrown of the head, the chief pride and glory of the enemy, shall besmitten; Christ shall crush the head of the serpent.
Psa 68:22-28	<br>The victories with which God blessed David over the enemies of Israel,are types of Christ's victory, for himself and for all believers. Thosewho take him for theirs, may see him acting as their God, as theirKing, for their good, and in answer to their prayers; especially in andby his word and ordinances. The kingdom of the Messiah shall besubmitted to by all the rulers and learned in the world. The peopleseem to address the king, 
Psa 68:28	<br>But the words are applicable tothe Redeemer, to his church, and every true believer. We pray, thatthou, O God the Son, wilt complete thine undertaking for us, byfinishing thy good work in us.
Psa 68:29-31	<br>A powerful invitation is given to those that are without, to join thechurch. Some shall submit from fear; overcome by their consciences, andthe checks of Providence, they are brought to make peace with thechurch. Others will submit willingly, 
Psa 68:29,31). There is thatbeauty and benefit in the service of God, and in the gospel of Christwhich went forth from Jerusalem, which is enough to invite sinners outof all nations.	
Psa 68:32-35	<br>God is to be admired and adored with reverence and godly fear, by allthat attend in his holy places. The God of Israel gives strength andpower unto his people. Through Christ strengthening us we can do allthings, not otherwise; therefore he must have the glory of all we do,with our humble thanks for enabling us to do it, and for accepting thework of his hands in us.
Psa 69:1-12	<br>We should frequently consider the person of the Sufferer here spokenof, and ask why, as well as what he suffered, that, meditating thereon,we may be more humbled for sin, and more convinced of our danger, sothat we may feel more gratitude and love, constraining us to live toHis glory who died for our salvation. Hence we learn, when inaffliction, to commit the keeping of our souls to God, that we may notbe soured with discontent, or sink into despair. David was hatedwrongfully, but the words far more fully apply to Christ. In a worldwhere unrighteousness reigns so much, we must not wonder if we meetwith those that are our enemies wrongfully. Let us take care that wenever do wrong; then if we receive wrong, we may the better bear it. Bythe satisfaction Christ made to God for our sin by his blood, herestored that which he took not away, he paid our debt, suffered forour offences. Even when we can plead Not guilty, as to men's unjustaccusations, yet before God we must acknowledge ourselves to deserveall that is brought upon us. All our sins take rise from ourfoolishness. They are all done in God's sight. David complains of theunkindness of friends and relations. This was fulfilled in Christ,whose brethren did not believe on him, and who was forsaken by hisdisciples. Christ made satisfaction for us, not only by putting off thehonours due to God, but by submitting to the greatest dishonours thatcould be done to any man. We need not be discouraged if our zeal forthe truths, precepts, and worship of God, should provoke some, andcause others to mock our godly sorrow and deadness to the world.
Psa 69:13-21	<br>Whatever deep waters of affliction or temptation we sink into, whateverfloods of trouble or ungodly men seem ready to overwhelm us, let uspersevere in prayer to our Lord to save us. The tokens of God's favourto us are enough to keep our spirits from sinking in the deepestoutward troubles. If we think well of God, and continue to do so underthe greatest hardships, we need not fear but he will do well for us.And if at any time we are called on to suffer reproach and shame, forChrist's sake, this may be our comfort, that he knows it. It bears hardon one that knows the worth of a good name, to be oppressed with a badone; but when we consider what a favour it is to be accounted worthy tosuffer shame for the name of Jesus, we shall see that there is noreason why it should be heart-breaking to us. The sufferings of Christwere here particularly foretold, which proves the Scripture to be theword of God; and how exactly these predictions were fulfilled in JesusChrist, which proves him to be the true Messiah. The vinegar and thegall given to him, were a faint emblem of that bitter cup which hedrank up, that we might drink the cup of salvation. We cannot expecttoo little from men, miserable comforters are they all; nor can weexpect too much from the God of all comfort and consolation.
Psa 69:22-29	<br>These are prophecies of the destruction of Christ's persecutors. Verses#(22,23), are applied to the judgments of God upon the unbelievingJews, in Ro 11:9,10. When the supports of life and delights of sense,through the corruption of our nature, are made the food and fuel ofsin, then our table is a snare. Their sin was, that they would not see,but shut their eyes against the light, loving darkness rather; theirpunishment was, that they should not see, but should be given up totheir own hearts' lusts which hardened them. Those who reject God'sgreat salvation proffered to them, may justly fear that his indignationwill be poured out upon them. If men will sin, the Lord will reckon forit. But those that have multiplied to sin, may yet find mercy, throughthe righteousness of the Mediator. God shuts not out any from thatrighteousness; the gospel excludes none who do not, by unbelief, shutthemselves out. But those who are proud and self-willed, so that theywill not come in to God's righteousness, shall have their doomaccordingly; they themselves decide it. Let those not expect anybenefit thereby, who are not glad to be beholden to it. It is better tobe poor and sorrowful, with the blessing of the Lord, than rich andjovial, and under his curse. This may be applied to Christ. He was,when on earth, a man of sorrows that had not where to lay his head; butGod exalted him. Let us call upon the Lord, and though poor andsorrowful, guilty and defiled, his salvation will set us up on high.
Psa 69:30-36	<br>The psalmist concludes the psalm with holy joy and praise, which hebegan with complaints of his grief. It is a great comfort to us, thathumble and thankful praises are more pleasing to God than the mostcostly, pompous sacrifices. The humble shall look to him, and be glad;those that seek him through Christ shall live and be comforted. Godwill do great things for the gospel church, in which let all who wishwell to it rejoice. A seed shall serve him on earth, and his servantsshall inherit his heavenly kingdom. Those that love his name shalldwell before him for ever. He that spared not his own Son, butdelivered him up for us all, how shall he not with him also freely giveus all things? Arise, thou great Restorer of the ancient places todwell in, and turn away ungodliness from thy people.
Psa 71:1-13	<br>David prays that he might never be made ashamed of dependence upon God.With this petition every true believer may come boldly to the throne ofgrace. The gracious care of Divine providence in our birth and infancy,should engage us to early piety. He that was our Help from our birth,ought to be our Hope from our youth. Let none expect ease or comfortfrom the world. Those who love the Lord, often are hated andpersecuted; men wondered at for their principles and conduct; but theLord has been their strong refuge. The faithful servants of God may beassured that he will not cast them off in old age, nor forsake themwhen their strength fails.
Psa 71:14-24	<br>The psalmist declares that the righteousness of Christ, and the greatsalvation obtained thereby, shall be the chosen subject of hisdiscourse. Not on a sabbath only, but on every day of the week, of theyear, of his life. Not merely at stated returns of solemn devotion, buton every occasion, all the day long. Why will he always dwell on this?Because he knew not the numbers thereof. It is impossible to measurethe value or the fulness of these blessings. The righteousness isunspeakable, the salvation everlasting. God will not cast off hisgrey-headed servants when no longer capable of labouring as they havedone. The Lord often strengthens his people in their souls, when natureis sinking into decay. And it is a debt which the old disciples ofChrist owe to succeeding generations, to leave behind them a solemntestimony to the advantage of religion, and the truth of God'spromises; and especially to the everlasting righteousness of theRedeemer. Assured of deliverance and victory, let us spend our days,while waiting the approach of death, in praising the Holy One of Israelwith all our powers. And while speaking of his righteousness, andsinging his praises, we shall rise above fears and infirmities, andhave earnests of the joys of heaven. The work of redemption ought,above all God's works, to be spoken of by us in our praises. The Lambthat was slain, and has redeemed us to God, is worthy of all blessingand praise.
Psa 72:2-17	<br>This is a prophecy of the kingdom of Christ; many passages in it cannotbe applied to the reign of Solomon. There were righteousness and peaceat first in the administration of his government; but, before the endof his reign, there were troubles and unrighteousness. The kingdom herespoken of is to last as long as the sun, but Solomon's was soon at anend. Even the Jewish expositors understood it of the kingdom of theMessiah. Observe many great and precious promises here made, which wereto have full accomplishment only in the kingdom of Christ. As far ashis kingdom is set up, discord and contentions cease, in families,churches, and nations. The law of Christ, written in the heart,disposes men to be honest and just, and to render to all their due; itlikewise disposes men to live in love, and so produces abundance ofpeace. Holiness and love shall be lasting in Christ's kingdom. Throughall the changes of the world, and all the changes of life, Christ'skingdom will support itself. And he shall, by the graces and comfortsof his Spirit, come down like rain upon the mown grass; not on that cutdown, but that which is left growing, that it may spring again. Hisgospel has been, or shall be, preached to all nations. Though he needsnot the services of any, yet he must be served with the best. Thosethat have the wealth of this world, must serve Christ with it, do goodwith it. Prayer shall be made through him, or for his sake; whatever weask of the Father, should be in his name. Praises shall be offered tohim: we are under the highest obligations to him. Christ only shall befeared throughout all generations. To the end of time, and to eternity,his name shall be praised. All nations shall call HIM blessed.
Psa 72:18-20	<br>We are taught to bless God in Christ, for all he has done for us byhim. David is earnest in prayer for the fulfilment of this prophecy andpromise. It is sad to think how empty the earth is of the glory of God,how little service and honour he has from a world to which he is sobountiful. May we, like David, submit to Christ's authority, andpartake of his righteousness and peace. May we bless him for thewonders of redeeming love. May we spend our days, and end our lives,praying for the spread of his gospel.
Psa 73:1-14	<br>The psalmist was strongly tempted to envy the prosperity of the wicked;a common temptation, which has tried the graces of many saints. But helays down the great principle by which he resolved to abide. It is thegoodness of God. This is a truth which cannot be shaken. Good thoughtsof God will fortify against Satan's temptations. The faith even ofstrong believers may be sorely shaken, and ready to fail. There arestorms that will try the firmest anchors. Foolish and wicked peoplehave sometimes a great share of outward prosperity. They seem to havethe least share of the troubles of this life; and they seem to have thegreatest share of its comforts. They live without the fear of God, yetthey prosper, and get on in the world. Wicked men often spend theirlives without much sickness, and end them without great pain; whilemany godly persons scarcely know what health is, and die with greatsufferings. Often the wicked are not frightened, either by theremembrance of their sins, or the prospect of their misery, but theydie without terror. We cannot judge men's state beyond death, by whatpasses at their death. He looked abroad, and saw many of God's peoplegreatly at a loss. Because the wicked are so very daring, therefore hispeople return hither; they know not what to say to it, and the rather,because they drink deep of the bitter cup of affliction. He spokefeelingly when he spoke of his own troubles; there is no disputingagainst sense, except by faith. From all this arose a strong temptationto cast off religion. But let us learn that the true course ofsanctification consists in cleansing a man from all pollution both ofsoul and body. The heart is cleansed by the blood of Christ laid holdupon by faith; and by the begun works of the Lord's Spirit, manifestedin the hearty resolution, purpose, and study of holiness, and ablameless course of life and actions, the hands are cleansed. It is notin vain to serve God and keep his ordinances.
Psa 73:15-20	<br>The psalmist having shown the progress of his temptation, shows howfaith and grace prevailed. He kept up respect for God's people, andwith that he restrained himself from speaking what he had thoughtamiss. It is a sign that we repent of the evil thoughts of the heart,if we suppress them. Nothing gives more offence to God's children, thanto say it is vain to serve God; for there is nothing more contrary totheir universal experience. He prayed to God to make this matter plainto him; and he understood the wretched end of wicked people; even inthe height of their prosperity they were but ripening for ruin. Thesanctuary must be the resort of a tempted soul. The righteous man'safflictions end in peace, therefore he is happy; the wicked man'senjoyments end in destruction, therefore he is miserable. Theprosperity of the wicked is short and uncertain, slippery places. Seewhat their prosperity is; it is but a vain show, it is only a corruptimagination, not substance, but a mere shadow; it is as a dream, whichmay please us a little while we are slumbering, yet even then itdisturbs our repose.
Psa 73:21-28	<br>God would not suffer his people to be tempted, if his grace were notsufficient, not only to save them from harm, but to make them gainersby it. This temptation, the working of envy and discontent, is verypainful. In reflecting upon it, the psalmist owns it was his folly andignorance thus to vex himself. If good men, at any time, through thesurprise and strength of temptation, think, or speak, or act amiss,they will reflect upon it with sorrow and shame. We must ascribe oursafety in temptation, and our victory, not to our own wisdom, but tothe gracious presence of God with us, and Christ's intercession for us.All who commit themselves to God, shall be guided with the counsel bothof his word and of his Spirit, the best counsellors here, and shall bereceived to his glory in another world; the believing hopes andprospects of which will reconcile us to all dark providences. And thepsalmist was hereby quickened to cleave the closer to God. Heavenitself could not make us happy without the presence and love of ourGod. The world and all its glory vanishes. The body will fail bysickness, age, and death; when the flesh fails, the conduct, courage,and comfort fail. But Christ Jesus, our Lord, offers to be all in allto every poor sinner, who renounces all other portions and confidences.By sin we are all far from God. And a profession Christ, if we go on insin, will increase our condemnation. May we draw near, and keep near,to our God, by faith and prayer, and find it good to do so. Those thatwith an upright heart put their trust in God, shall never want matterfor thanksgiving to him. Blessed Lord, who hast so graciously promisedto become our portion in the next world, prevent us from choosing anyother in this.
Psa 74:1-11	<br>This psalm appears to describe the destruction of Jerusalem and thetemple by the Chaldeans. The deplorable case of the people of God, atthe time, is spread before the Lord, and left with him. They plead thegreat things God had done for them. If the deliverance of Israel out ofEgypt was encouragement to hope that he would not cast them off, muchmore reason have we to believe, that God will not cast off any whomChrist has redeemed with his own blood. Infidels and persecutors maysilence faithful ministers, and shut up places of worship, and say theywill destroy the people of God and their religion together. For a longtime they may prosper in these attempts, and God's oppressed servantsmay see no prospect of deliverance; but there is a remnant ofbelievers, the seed of a future harvest, and the despised church hassurvived those who once triumphed over her. When the power of enemiesis most threatening, it is comfortable to flee to the power of God byearnest prayer.
Psa 74:12-17	<br>The church silences her own complaints. What God had done for hispeople, as their King of old, encouraged them to depend on him. It wasthe Lord's doing, none besides could do it. This providence was food tofaith and hope, to support and encourage in difficulties. The God ofIsrael is the God of nature. He that is faithful to his covenant aboutthe day and the night, will never cast off those whom he has chosen. Wehave as much reason to expect affliction, as to expect night andwinter. But we have no more reason to despair of the return of comfort,than to despair of day and summer. And in the world above we shall haveno more changes.
Psa 74:18-23	<br>The psalmist begs that God would appear for the church against theirenemies. The folly of such as revile his gospel and his servants willbe plain to all. Let us call upon our God to enlighten the dark nationsof the earth; and to rescue his people, that the poor and needy maypraise his name. Blessed Saviour, thou art the same yesterday, to-day,and for ever. Make thy people more than conquerors. Be thou, Lord, allin all to them in every situation and circumstances; for then thy poorand needy people will praise thy name.
Psa 75:1-5	<br>We often pray for mercy, when in pursuit of it; and shall we only onceor twice give thanks, when we obtain it? God shows that he is nigh tous in what we call upon him for. Public trusts are to be manageduprightly. This may well be applied to Christ and his government. Man'ssin threatened to destroy the whole creation; but Christ saved theworld from utter ruin. He who is made of God to us wisdom, bids us bewise. To the proud, daring sinners he says, Boast not of your power,persist not in contempt. All the present hopes and future happiness ofthe human race spring from the Son of God.
Psa 75:6-10	<br>No second causes will raise men to preferment without the First Cause.It comes neither from the east, nor from the west, nor from the south.He mentions not the north; the same word that signifies the north,signifies the secret place; and from the secret of God's counsel itdoes come. From God alone all must receive their doom. There aremixtures of mercy and grace in the cup of affliction, when it is putinto the hands of God's people; mixtures of the curse, when it is putinto the hands of the wicked. God's people have their share in commoncalamities, but the dregs of the cup are for the wicked. The exaltationof the Son of David will be the subject of the saints' everlastingpraises. Then let sinners submit to the King of righteousness, and letbelievers rejoice in and obey him.
Psa 76:1-6	<br>Happy people are those who have their land filled with the knowledge ofGod! happy persons that have their hearts filled with that knowledge!It is the glory and happiness of a people to have God among them by hisordinances. Wherein the enemies of the church deal proudly, it willappear that God is above them. See the power of God's rebukes. Withpleasure may Christians apply this to the advantages bestowed by theRedeemer.
Psa 76:7-12	<br>God's people are the meek of the earth, the quiet in the land, thatsuffer wrong, but do none. The righteous God seems to keep silencelong, yet, sooner or later, he will make judgment to be heard. We livein an angry, provoking world; we often feel much, and are apt to fearmore, from the wrath of man. What will not turn to his praise, shallnot be suffered to break out. He can set bounds to the wrath of man, ashe does to the raging sea; hitherto it shall come, and no further. Letall submit to God. Our prayers and praises, and especially our hearts,are the presents we should bring to the Lord. His name is glorious, andhe is the proper object of our fear. He shall cut off the spirit ofprinces; he shall slip it off easily, as we slip off a flower from thestalk, or a bunch of grapes from the vine; so the word signifies. Hecan dispirit the most daring: since there is no contending with God, itis our wisdom, as it is our duty, to submit to him. Let us seek hisfavour as our portion, and commit all our concerns to him.
Psa 77:1-10	<br>Days of trouble must be days of prayer; when God seems to havewithdrawn from us, we must seek him till we find him. In the day of histrouble the psalmist did not seek for the diversion of business oramusement, but he sought God, and his favor and grace. Those that areunder trouble of mind, must pray it away. He pored upon the trouble;the methods that should have relieved him did but increase his grief.When he remembered God, it was only the Divine justice and wrath. Hisspirit was overwhelmed, and sank under the load. But let not theremembrance of the comforts we have lost, make us unthankful for thosethat are left. Particularly he called to remembrance the comforts withwhich he supported himself in former sorrows. Here is the language of asorrowful, deserted soul, walking in darkness; a common case even amongthose that fear the Lord, Isa 50:10. Nothing wounds and pierces likethe thought of God's being angry. God's own people, in a cloudy anddark day, may be tempted to make wrong conclusions about theirspiritual state, and that of God's kingdom in the world. But we mustnot give way to such fears. Let faith answer them from the Scripture.The troubled fountain will work itself clear again; and therecollection of former times of joyful experience often raises a hope,tending to relief. Doubts and fears proceed from the want and weaknessof faith. Despondency and distrust under affliction, are too often theinfirmities of believers, and, as such, are to be thought upon by uswith sorrow and shame. When, unbelief is working in us, we must thussuppress its risings.
Psa 77:11-20	<br>The remembrance of the works of God, will be a powerful remedy againstdistrust of his promise and goodness; for he is God, and changes not.God's way is in the sanctuary. We are sure that God is holy in all hisworks. God's ways are like the deep waters, which cannot be fathomed;like the way of a ship, which cannot be tracked. God brought Israel outof Egypt. This was typical of the great redemption to be wrought out inthe fulness of time, both by price and power. If we have harboureddoubtful thoughts, we should, without delay, turn our minds to meditateon that God, who spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for usall, that with him, he might freely give us all things.
Psa 78:1-8	<br>These are called dark and deep sayings, because they are carefully tobe looked into. The law of God was given with a particular charge toteach it diligently to their children, that the church may abide forever. Also, that the providences of God, both in mercy and in judgment,might encourage them to conform to the will of God. The works of Godmuch strengthen our resolution to keep his commandments. Hypocrisy isthe high road to apostacy; those that do not set their hearts right,will not be stedfast with God. Many parents, by negligence andwickedness, become murderers of their children. But young persons,though they are bound to submit in all things lawful, must not obeysinful orders, or copy sinful examples.
Psa 78:9-39	<br>Sin dispirits men, and takes away the heart. Forgetfulness of God'sworks is the cause of disobedience to his laws. This narrative relatesa struggle between God's goodness and man's badness. The Lord hears allour murmurings and distrusts, and is much displeased. Those that willnot believe the power of God's mercy, shall feel the fire of hisindignation. Those cannot be said to trust in God's salvation as theirhappiness at last, who can not trust his providence in the way to it.To all that by faith and prayer, ask, seek, and knock, these doors ofheaven shall at any time be opened; and our distrust of God is a greataggravation of our sins. He expressed his resentment of theirprovocation; not in denying what they sinfully lusted after, but ingranting it to them. Lust is contented with nothing. Those that indulgetheir lust, will never be estranged from it. Those hearts are hardindeed, that will neither be melted by the mercies of the Lord, norbroken by his judgments. Those that sin still, must expect to be introuble still. And the reason why we live with so little comfort, andto so little purpose, is, because we do not live by faith. Under theserebukes they professed repentance, but they were not sincere, for theywere not constant. In Israel's history we have a picture of our ownhearts and lives. God's patience, and warnings, and mercies, imboldenthem to harden their hearts against his word. And the history ofkingdoms is much the same. Judgments and mercies have been littleattended to, until the measure of their sins has been full. And higheradvantages have not kept churches from declining from the commandmentsof God. Even true believers recollect, that for many a year they abusedthe kindness of Providence. When they come to heaven, how will theyadmire the Lord's patience and mercy in bringing them to his kingdom!
Psa 78:40-55	<br>Let not those that receive mercy from God, be thereby made bold to sin,for the mercies they receive will hasten its punishment; yet let notthose who are under Divine rebukes for sin, be discouraged fromrepentance. The Holy One of Israel will do what is most for his ownglory, and what is most for their good. Their forgetting formerfavours, led them to limit God for the future. God made his own peopleto go forth like sheep; and guided them in the wilderness, as ashepherd his flock, with all care and tenderness. Thus the true Joshua,even Jesus, brings his church out of the wilderness; but no earthlyCanaan, no worldly advantages, should make us forget that the church isin the wilderness while in this world, and that there remaineth a farmore glorious rest for the people of God.
Psa 78:56-72	<br>After the Israelites were settled in Canaan, the children were liketheir fathers. God gave them his testimonies, but they turned back.Presumptuous sins render even Israelites hateful to God's holiness, andexposed to his justice. Those whom the Lord forsakes become an easyprey to the destroyer. And sooner or later, God will disgrace hisenemies. He set a good government over his people; a monarch after hisown heart. With good reason does the psalmist make this finishing,crowning instance of God's favour to Israel; for David was a type ofChrist, the great and good Shepherd, who was humbled first, and thenexalted; and of whom it was foretold, that he should be filled with theSpirit of wisdom and understanding. On the uprightness of his heart,and the skilfulness of his hands, all his subjects may rely; and of theincrease of his government and peace there shall be no end. Every trialof human nature hitherto, confirms the testimony of Scripture, that theheart is deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked, andnothing but being created anew by the Holy Ghost can cure theungodliness of any.
Psa 79:1-5	<br>God is complained to: whither should children go but to a Father ableand willing to help them? See what a change sin made in the holy city,when the heathen were suffered to pour in upon them. God's own peopledefiled it by their sins, therefore he suffered their enemies to defileit by their insolence. They desired that God would be reconciled. Thosewho desire God's favour as better than life, cannot but dread his wrathas worse than death. In every affliction we should first beseech theLord to cleanse away the guilt of our sins; then he will visit us withhis tender mercies.
Psa 79:6-13	<br>Those who persist in ignorance of God, and neglect of prayer, are theungodly. How unrighteous soever men were, the Lord was righteous inpermitting them to do what they did. Deliverances from trouble aremercies indeed, when grounded upon the pardon of sin; we shouldtherefore be more earnest in prayer for the removal of our sins thanfor the removal of afflictions. They had no hopes but from God'smercies, his tender mercies. They plead no merit, they pretend to none,but, Help us for the glory of thy name; pardon us for thy name's sake.The Christian forgets not that he is often bound in the chain of hissins. The world to him is a prison; sentence of death is passed uponhim, and he knows not how soon it may be executed. How fervently shouldhe at all times pray, O let the sighing of a prisoner come before thee,according to the greatness of thy power preserve thou those that areappointed to die! How glorious will the day be, when, triumphant oversin and sorrow, the church beholds the adversary disarmed for ever!while that church shall, from age to age, sing the praises of her greatShepherd and Bishop, her King and her God.
Psa 80:1-7	<br>He that dwelleth upon the mercy-seat, is the good Shepherd of hispeople. But we can neither expect the comfort of his love, nor theprotection of his arm, unless we partake of his converting grace. If heis really angry at the prayers of his people, it is because, althoughthey pray, their ends are not right, or there is some secret sinindulged in them, or he will try their patience and perseverance inprayer. When God is displeased with his people, we must expect to seethem in tears, and their enemies in triumph. There is no salvation butfrom God's favour; there is no conversion to God but by his own grace.
Psa 80:8-16	<br>The church is represented as a vine and a vineyard. The root of thisvine is Christ, the branches are believers. The church is like a vine,needing support, but spreading and fruitful. If a vine do not bringforth fruit, no tree is so worthless. And are not we planted as in awell-cultivated garden, with every means of being fruitful in works ofrighteousness? But the useless leaves of profession, and the emptyboughs of notions and forms, abound far more than real piety. It waswasted and ruined. There was a good reason for this change in God's waytoward them. And it is well or ill with us, according as we are underGod's smiles or frowns. When we consider the state of the purest partof the visible church, we cannot wonder that it is visited with sharpcorrections. They request that God would help the vine. Lord, it isformed by thyself, and for thyself, therefore it may, with humbleconfidence, be committed to thyself.
Psa 80:17-19	<br>The Messiah, the Protector and Saviour of the church, is the Man ofGod's right hand; he is the Arm of the Lord, for all power is given tohim. In him is our strength, by which we are enabled to persevere tothe end. The vine, therefore, cannot be ruined, nor can any fruitfulbranch perish; but the unfruitful will be cut off and cast into thefire. The end of our redemption is, that we should serve Him who hathredeemed us, and not go back to our old sins.
Psa 81:1-7	<br>All the worship we can render to the Lord is beneath his excellences,and our obligations to him, especially in our redemption from sin andwrath. What God had done on Israel's behalf, was kept in remembrance bypublic solemnities. To make a deliverance appear more gracious, moreglorious, it is good to observe all that makes the trouble we aredelivered from appear more grievous. We ought never to forget the baseand ruinous drudgery to which Satan, our oppressor, brought us. Butwhen, in distress of conscience, we are led to cry for deliverance, theLord answers our prayers, and sets us at liberty. Convictions of sin,and trials by affliction, prove his regard to his people. If the Jews,on their solemn feast-days, were thus to call to mind their redemptionout of Egypt, much more ought we, on the Christian sabbath, to call tomind a more glorious redemption, wrought out for us by our Lord JesusChrist, from worse bondage.
Psa 81:8-16	<br>We cannot look for too little from the creature, nor too much from theCreator. We may have enough from God, if we pray for it in faith. Allthe wickedness of the world is owing to man's wilfulness. People arenot religious, because they will not be so. God is not the Author oftheir sin, he leaves them to the lusts of their own hearts, and thecounsels of their own heads; if they do not well, the blame must beupon themselves. The Lord is unwilling that any should perish. Whatenemies sinners are to themselves! It is sin that makes our troubleslong, and our salvation slow. Upon the same conditions of faith andobedience, do Christians hold those spiritual and eternal good things,which the pleasant fields and fertile hills of Canaan showed forth.Christ is the Bread of life; he is the Rock of salvation, and hispromises are as honey to pious minds. But those who reject him as theirLord and Master, must also lose him as their Saviour and their reward.
Psa 82:1-5	<br>Magistrates are the mighty in authority for the public good.Magistrates are the ministers of God's providence, for keeping up orderand peace, and particularly in punishing evil-doers, and protectingthose that do well. Good princes and good judges, who mean well, areunder Divine direction; and bad ones, who mean ill, are under Divinerestraint. The authority of God is to be submitted to, in thosegovernors whom his providence places over us. But when justice isturned from what is right, no good can be expected. The evil actions ofpublic persons are public mischiefs.
Psa 82:6-8	<br>It is hard for men to have honour put upon them, and not to be proud ofit. But all the rulers of the earth shall die, and all their honourshall be laid in the dust. God governs the world. There is a righteousGod to whom we may go, and on whom we may depend. This also has respectto the kingdom of the Messiah. Considering the state of affairs in theworld, we have need to pray that the Lord Jesus would speedily ruleover all nations, in truth, righteousness, and peace.
Psa 83:1-8	<br>Sometimes God seems not to be concerned at the unjust treatment of hispeople. But then we may call upon him, as the psalmist here. All wickedpeople are God's enemies, especially wicked persecutors. The Lord'speople are his hidden one; the world knows them not. He takes themunder his special protection. Do the enemies of the church act with oneconsent to destroy it, and shall not the friends of the church beunited? Wicked men wish that there might be no religion among mankind.They would gladly see all its restraints shaken off, and all thatpreach, profess, or practise it, cut off. This they would bring to passif it were in their power. The enemies of God's church have always beenmany: this magnifies the power of the Lord in preserving to himself achurch in the world.
Psa 83:9-18	<br>All who oppose the kingdom of Christ may here read their doom. God isthe same still that ever he was; the same to his people, and the sameagainst his and their enemies. God would make their enemies like awheel; unsettled in all their counsels and resolves. Not only let thembe driven away as stubble, but burnt as stubble. And this will be theend of wicked men. Let them be made to fear thy name, and perhaps thatwill bring them to seek thy name. We should desire no confusion to ourenemies and persecutors but what may forward their conversion. Thestormy tempest of Divine vengeance will overtake them, unless theyrepent and seek the pardoning mercy of their offended Lord. God'striumphs over his enemies, clearly prove that he is, according to hisname JEHOVAH, an almighty Being, who has all power and perfection inhimself. May we fear his wrath, and yield ourselves to be his willingservants. And let us seek deliverance by the destruction of our fleshlylusts, which war against the soul.
Psa 84:1-7	<br>The ordinances of God are the believer's solace in this evil world; inthem he enjoys the presence of the living God: this causes him toregret his absence from them. They are to his soul as the nest to thebird. Yet they are only an earnest of the happiness of heaven; but howcan men desire to enter that holy habitation, who complain of Divineordinances as wearisome? Those are truly happy, who go forth, and go onin the exercise of religion, in the strength of the grace of JesusChrist, from whom all our sufficiency is. The pilgrims to the heavenlycity may have to pass through many a valley of weeping, and many athirsty desert; but wells of salvation shall be opened for them, andconsolations sent for their support. Those that press forward in theirChristian course, shall find God add grace to their graces. And thosewho grow in grace, shall be perfect in glory.
Psa 84:8-12	<br>In all our addresses to God, we must desire that he would look onChrist, his Anointed One, and accept us for his sake: we must look toHim with faith, and then God will with favour look upon the face of theAnointed: we, without him, dare not show our faces. The psalmist pleadslove to God's ordinances. Let us account one day in God's courts betterthan a thousand spent elsewhere; and deem the meanest place in hisservice preferable to the highest earthly preferment. We are here indarkness, but if God be our God, he will be to us a Sun, to enlightenand enliven us, to guide and direct us. We are here in danger, but hewill be to us a Shield, to secure us from the fiery darts that flythick about us. Through he has not promised to give riches anddignities, he has promised to give grace and glory to all that seekthem in his appointed way. And what is grace, but heaven begun below,in the knowledge, love, and service of God? What is glory, but thecompletion of this happiness, in being made like to him, and in fullyenjoying him for ever? Let it be our care to walk uprightly, and thenlet us trust God to give us every thing that is good for us. If wecannot go to the house of the Lord, we may go by faith to the Lord ofthe house; in him we shall be happy, and may be easy. That man isreally happy, whatever his outward circumstances may be, who trusts inthe Lord of hosts, the God of Jacob.
Psa 85:1-7	<br>The sense of present afflictions should not do away the remembrance offormer mercies. The favour of God is the fountain of happiness tonations, as well as to particular persons. When God forgives sin, hecovers it; and when he covers the sin of his people, he covers it all.See what the pardon of sin is. In compassion to us, when Christ ourIntercessor has stood before thee, thou hast turned away thine anger.When we are reconciled to God, then, and not till then, we may expectthe comfort of his being reconciled to us. He shows mercy to those towhom he grants salvation; for salvation is of mere mercy. The Lord'speople may expect sharp and tedious afflictions when they commit sin;but when they return to him with humble prayer, he will make them againto rejoice in him.
Psa 85:8-13	<br>Sooner or later, God will speak peace to his people. If he do notcommand outward peace, yet he will suggest inward peace; speaking totheir hearts by his Spirit. Peace is spoken only to those who turn fromsin. All sin is folly, especially backsliding; it is the greatest follyto return to sin. Surely God's salvation is nigh, whatever ourdifficulties and distresses are. Also, his honour is secured, thatglory may dwell in our land. And the truth of the promises is shown bythe Divine mercy in sending the Redeemer. The Divine justice is nowsatisfied by the great atonement. Christ, the way, truth, and life,sprang out of the earth when he took our nature upon him, and Divinejustice looked upon him well pleased and satisfied. For his sake allgood things, especially his Holy Spirit, are given to those who askhim. Through Christ, the pardoned sinner becomes fruitful in goodworks, and by looking to and trusting in the Saviour's righteousness,finds his feet set in the way of his steps. Righteousness is a sureguide, both in meeting God, and in following him
Psa 86:1-7	<br>Our poverty and wretchedness, when felt, powerfully plead in our behalfat the throne of grace. The best self-preservation is to commitourselves to God's keeping. I am one whom thou favourest, hast setapart for thyself, and made partaker of sanctifying grace. It is agreat encouragement to prayer, to feel that we have received theconverting grace of God, have learned to trust in him, and to be hisservants. We may expect comfort from God, when we keep up our communionwith God. God's goodness appears in two things, in giving andforgiving. Whatever others do, let us call upon God, and commit ourcase to him; we shall not seek in vain.
Psa 86:8-17	<br>Our God alone possesses almighty power and infinite love. Christ is theway and the truth. And the believing soul will be more desirous to betaught the way and the truth. And the believing soul will be moredesirous to be taught the way and the truth of God, in order to walktherein, than to be delivered out of earthly distress. Those who setnot the Lord before them, seek after believers' souls; but thecompassion, mercy, and truth of God, will be their refuge andconsolation. And those whose parents were the servants of the Lord, mayurge this as a plea why he should hear and help them. In consideringDavid's experience, and that of the believer, we must not lose sight ofHim, who though he was rich, for our sakes became poor, that we throughhis poverty might be rich.
Psa 87:1-3	<br>Christ himself is the Foundation of the church, which God has laid.Holiness is the strength and firmness of the church. Let us not beashamed of the church of Christ in its meanest condition, nor of thosethat belong to it, since such glorious things are spoken of it. Otherfoundation can no man lay than that is laid, even Jesus Christ. Theglorious things spoken of Zion by the Spirit, were all typical ofChrist, and his work and offices; of the gospel church, its privilegesand members; of heaven, its glory and perfect happiness.
Psa 87:4-7	<br>The church of Christ is more glorious and excellent than the nations ofthe earth. In the records of heaven, the meanest of those who are bornagain stand registered. When God renders to every man according to hisworks, he shall observe who enjoyed the privileges of his sanctuary. Tothem much was given, and of them much will be required. Let those thatdwell in Zion, mark this, and live up to their profession. Zion's songsshall be sung with joy and triumph. The springs of the joy of a carnalworldling are in wealth and pleasure; but of a gracious soul, in theword of God and prayer. All grace and consolation are derived fromChrist, through his ordinances, to the souls of believers.
Psa 88:1-9	<br>The first words of the psalmist are the only words of comfort andsupport in this psalm. Thus greatly may good men be afflicted, and suchdismal thoughts may they have about their afflictions, and such darkconclusion may they make about their end, through the power ofmelancholy and the weakness of faith. He complained most of God'sdispleasure. Even the children of God's love may sometimes thinkthemselves children of wrath and no outward trouble can be so hard uponthem as that. Probably the psalmist described his own case, yet heleads to Christ. Thus are we called to look unto Jesus, wounded andbruised for our iniquities. But the wrath of God poured the greatestbitterness into his cup. This weighed him down into darkness and thedeep.
Psa 88:10-18	<br>Departed souls may declare God's faithfulness, justice, andlovingkindness; but deceased bodies can neither receive God's favoursin comfort, nor return them in praise. The psalmist resolved tocontinue in prayer, and the more so, because deliverance did not comespeedily. Though our prayers are not soon answered, yet we must notgive over praying. The greater our troubles, the more earnest andserious we should be in prayer. Nothing grieves a child of God so muchas losing sight of him; nor is there any thing he so much dreads asGod's casting off his soul. If the sun be clouded, that darkens theearth; but if the sun should leave the earth, what a dungeon would itbe! Even those designed for God's favours, may for a time suffer histerrors. See how deep those terrors wounded the psalmist. If friendsare put far from us by providences, or death, we have reason to lookupon it as affliction. Such was the calamitous state of a good man. Butthe pleas here used were peculiarly suited to Christ. And we are not tothink that the holy Jesus suffered for us only at Gethsemane and onCalvary. His whole life was labour and sorrow; he was afflicted asnever man was, from his youth up. He was prepared for that death ofwhich he tasted through life. No man could share in the sufferings bywhich other men were to be redeemed. All forsook him, and fled.Oftentimes, blessed Jesus, do we forsake thee; but do not forsake us, Otake not thy Holy Spirit from us.
Psa 89:1-4	<br>Though our expectations may be disappointed, yet God's promises areestablished in the heavens, in his eternal counsels; they are out ofthe reach of opposers in hell and earth. And faith in the boundlessmercy and everlasting truth of God, may bring comfort even in thedeepest trials.
Psa 89:5-14	<br>The more God's works are known, the more they are admired. And topraise the Lord, is to acknowledge him to be such a one that there isnone like him. Surely then we should feel and express reverence when weworship God. But how little of this appears in our congregations, andhow much cause have we to humble ourselves on this account! Thatalmighty power which smote Egypt, will scatter the enemies of thechurch, while all who trust in God's mercy will rejoice in his name;for mercy and truth direct all he does. His counsels from eternity, andtheir consequences to eternity, are all justice and judgment.
Psa 89:15-18	<br>Happy are those who so know the joyful sound of the gospel as to obeyit; who experience its power upon their hearts, and bring forth thefruit of it in their lives. Though believers are nothing in themselves,yet having all in Christ Jesus, they may rejoice in his name. May theLord enable us to do so. The joy of the Lord is the strength of hispeople; whereas unbelief dispirits ourselves and discourages others.Though it steals upon us under a semblance of humility, yet it is thevery essence of pride. Christ is the Holy One of Israel; and in him wasthat peculiar people more blessed than in any other blessing.
Psa 89:19-37	<br>The Lord anointed David with the holy oil, not only as an emblem of thegraces and gifts he received, but as a type of Christ, the King Priest,and Prophet, anointed with the Holy Ghost without measure. David afterhis anointing, was persecuted, but none could gain advantage againsthim. Yet all this was a faint shadow of the Redeemer's sufferings,deliverance, glory, and authority, in whom alone these predictions andpromises are fully brought to pass. He is the mighty God. This is theRedeemer appointed for us, who alone is able to complete the work ofour salvation. Let us seek an interest in these blessings, by thewitness of the Holy Spirit in our hearts. As the Lord corrected theposterity of David for their transgressions, so his people shall becorrected for their sins. Yet it is but a rod, not a sword; it is tocorrect, not to destroy. It is a rod in the hand of God, who is wise,and knows what he does; gracious, and will do what is best. It is a rodwhich they shall never feel, but when there is need. As the sun andmoon remain in heaven, whatever changes there seem to be in them, andagain appear in due season; so the covenant of grace made in Christ,whatever alteration seems to come to it, should not be questioned.
Psa 89:38-52	<br>Sometimes it is not easy to reconcile God's providences with hispromises, yet we are sure that God's works fulfil his word. When thegreat Anointed One, Christ himself, was upon the cross, God seemed tohave cast him off, yet did not make void his covenant, for that wasestablished for ever. The honour of the house of David was lost.Thrones and crowns are often laid in the dust; but there is a crown ofglory reserved for Christ's spiritual seed, which fadeth not away. Fromall this complaint learn what work sin makes with families, noblefamilies, with families in which religion has appeared. They plead withGod for mercy. God's unchangeableness and faithfulness assure us thatHe will not cast off those whom he has chosen and covenanted with. Theywere reproached for serving him. The scoffers of the latter days, inlike manner, reproach the footsteps of the Messiah when they ask, Whereis the promise of his coming? 2Pe 3:3,4. The records of the Lord'sdealings with the family of David, show us his dealings with hischurch, and with believers. Their afflictions and distresses may begrievous, but he will not finally cast them off. Self-deceivers abusethis doctrine, and others by a careless walk bring themselves intodarkness and distress; yet let the true believer rely on it forencouragement in the path of duty, and in bearing the cross. The psalmends with praise, even after this sad complaint. Those who give Godthanks for what he has done, may give him thanks for what he will do.God will follow those with his mercies, who follow him with praises.
Psa 90:1-6	<br>It is supposed that this psalm refers to the sentence passed on Israelin the wilderness, Nu 14. The favour and protection of God are the onlysure rest and comfort of the soul in this evil world. Christ Jesus isthe refuge and dwelling-place to which we may repair. We are dyingcreatures, all our comforts in the world are dying comforts, but God isan ever-living God, and believers find him so. When God, by sickness,or other afflictions, turns men to destruction, he thereby calls men toreturn unto him to repent of their sins, and live a new life. Athousand years are nothing to God's eternity: between a minute and amillion of years there is some proportion; between time and eternitythere is none. All the events of a thousand years, whether past or tocome, are more present to the Eternal Mind, than what was done in thelast hour is to us. And in the resurrection, the body and soul shallboth return and be united again. Time passes unobserved by us, as withmen asleep; and when it is past, it is as nothing. It is a short andquickly-passing life, as the waters of a flood. Man does but flourishas the grass, which, when the winter of old age comes, will wither; buthe may be mown down by disease or disaster.
Psa 90:7-11	<br>The afflictions of the saints often come from God's love; but therebukes of sinners, and of believers for their sins, must be seencoming from the displeasure of God. Secret sins are known to God, andshall be reckoned for. See the folly of those who go about to covertheir sins, for they cannot do so. Our years, when gone, can no more berecalled than the words that we have spoken. Our whole life is toilsomeand troublesome; and perhaps, in the midst of the years we count upon,it is cut off. We are taught by all this to stand in awe. The angelsthat sinned know the power of God's anger; sinners in hell know it; butwhich of us can fully describe it? Few seriously consider it as theyought. Those who make a mock at sin, and make light of Christ, surelydo not know the power of God's anger. Who among us can dwell with thatdevouring fire?
Psa 90:12-17	<br>Those who would learn true wisdom, must pray for Divine instruction,must beg to be taught by the Holy Spirit; and for comfort and joy inthe returns of God's favour. They pray for the mercy of God, for theypretend not to plead any merit of their own. His favour would be a fullfountain of future joys. It would be a sufficient balance to formergriefs. Let the grace of God in us produce the light of good works. Andlet Divine consolations put gladness into our hearts, and a lustre uponour countenances. The work of our hands, establish thou it; and, inorder to that, establish us in it. Instead of wasting our precious,fleeting days in pursuing fancies, which leave the possessors for everpoor, let us seek the forgiveness of sins, and an inheritance inheaven. Let us pray that the work of the Holy Spirit may appear inconverting our hearts, and that the beauty of holiness may be seen inour conduct.
Psa 91:1-8	<br>He that by faith chooses God for his protector, shall find all in himthat he needs or can desire. And those who have found the comfort ofmaking the Lord their refuge, cannot but desire that others may do so.The spiritual life is protected by Divine grace from the temptations ofSatan, which are as the snares of the fowler, and from the contagion ofsin, which is a noisome pestilence. Great security is promised tobelievers in the midst of danger. Wisdom shall keep them from beingafraid without cause, and faith shall keep them from being undulyafraid. Whatever is done, our heavenly Father's will is done; and wehave no reason to fear. God's people shall see, not only God's promisesfulfilled, but his threatenings. Then let sinners come unto the Lordupon his mercy-seat, through the Redeemer's name; and encourage othersto trust in him also.
Psa 91:9-16	<br>Whatever happens, nothing shall hurt the believer; though trouble andaffliction befal, it shall come, not for his hurt, but for good, thoughfor the present it be not joyous but grievous. Those who rightly knowGod, will set their love upon him. They by prayer constantly call uponhim. His promise is, that he will in due time deliver the believer outof trouble, and in the mean time be with him in trouble. The Lord willmanage all his worldly concerns, and preserve his life on earth, solong as it shall be good for him. For encouragement in this he looksunto Jesus. He shall live long enough; till he has done the work he wassent into this world for, and is ready for heaven. Who would wish tolive a day longer than God has some work to do, either by him or uponhim? A man may die young, yet be satisfied with living. But a wickedman is not satisfied even with long life. At length the believer'sconflict ends; he has done for ever with trouble, sin, and temptation.
Psa 92:1-6	<br>It is a privilege that we are admitted to praise the Lord, and hope tobe accepted in the morning, and every night; not only on sabbath days,but every day; not only in public, but in private, and in our families.Let us give thanks every morning for the mercies of the night, andevery night for the mercies of the day; going out, and coming in, letus bless God. As He makes us glad, through the works of his providencefor us, and of his grace in us, and both through the great work ofredemption, let us hence be encouraged. As there are many who know notthe designs of Providence, nor care to know them, those who throughgrace do so, have the more reason to be thankful. And if distant viewsof the great Deliverer so animated believers of old, how should weabound in love and praise!
Psa 92:7-15	<br>God sometimes grants prosperity to wicked men in displeasure; yet theyflourish but for a moment. Let us seek for ourselves the salvation andgrace of the gospel, that being daily anointed by the Holy Spirit, wemay behold and share the Redeemer's glory. It is from his grace, by hisword and Spirit, that believers receive all the virtue that keeps themalive, and makes them fruitful. Other trees, when old, leave offbearing, but in God's trees the strength of grace does not fail withthe strength of nature. The last days of the saints are sometimes theirbest days, and their last work their best work: perseverance is sureevidence of sincerity. And may every sabbath, while it shows forth theDivine faithfulness, find our souls resting more and more upon the Lordour righteousness.
Psa 94:1-11	<br>We may with boldness appeal to God; for he is the almighty Judge bywhom every man is judged. Let this encourage those who suffer wrong, tobear it with silence, committing themselves to Him who judgesrighteously. These prayers are prophecies, which speak terror to thesons of violence. There will come a day of reckoning for all the hardspeeches which ungodly sinners have spoken against God, his truths, andways, and people. It would hardly be believed, if we did not witnessit, that millions of rational creatures should live, move, speak, hear,understand, and do what they purpose, yet act as if they believed thatGod would not punish the abuse of his gifts. As all knowledge is fromGod, no doubt he knows all the thoughts of the children of men, andknows that the imaginations of the thoughts of men's hearts are onlyevil, and that continually. Even in good thoughts there is a want ofbeing fixed, which may be called vanity. It concerns us to keep astrict watch over our thoughts, because God takes particular notice ofthem. Thoughts are words to God.
Psa 94:12-23	<br>That man is blessed, who, under the chastening of the Lord, is taughthis will and his truths, from his holy word, and by the Holy Spirit. Heshould see mercy through his sufferings. There is a rest remaining forthe people of God after the days of their adversity, which shall notlast always. He that sends the trouble, will send the rest. Thepsalmist found succour and relief only in the Lord, when all earthlyfriends failed. We are beholden, not only to God's power, but to hispity, for spiritual supports; and if we have been kept from fallinginto sin, or shrinking from our duty, we should give him the glory, andencourage our brethren. The psalmist had many troubled thoughtsconcerning the case he was in, concerning the course he should take,and what was likely to be the end of it. The indulgence of suchcontrivances and fears, adds to care and distrust, and renders ourviews more gloomy and confused. Good men sometimes have perplexed anddistressed thoughts concerning God. But let them look to the great andprecious promises of the gospel. The world's comforts give littledelight to the soul, when hurried with melancholy thoughts; but God'scomforts bring that peace and pleasure which the smiles of the worldcannot give, and which the frowns of the world cannot take away. God ishis people's Refuge, to whom they may flee, in whom they are safe, andmay be secure. And he will reckon with the wicked. A man cannot be moremiserable than his own wickedness will make him, if the Lord visit itupon him.
Psa 95:1-7	<br>Whenever we come into God's presence, we must come with thanksgiving.The Lord is to be praised; we do not want matter, it were well if wedid not want a heart. How great is that God, whose the whole earth is,and the fulness thereof; who directs and disposes of all!, The LordJesus, whom we are here taught to praise, is a great God; the mightyGod is one of his titles, and God over all, blessed for evermore. Tohim all power is given, both in heaven and earth. He is our God, and weshould praise him. He is our Saviour, and the Author of ourblessedness. The gospel church is his flock, Christ is the great andgood Shepherd of believers; he sought them when lost, and brought themto his fold.
Psa 95:7-11	<br>Christ calls upon his people to hear his voice. You call him Master, orLord; then be his willing, obedient people. Hear the voice of hisdoctrine, of his law, and in both, of his Spirit: hear and heed; hearand yield. Christ's voice must be heard to-day. This day of opportunitywill not last always; improve it while it is called to-day. Hearing thevoice of Christ is the same with believing. Hardness of heart is at thebottom of all distrust of the Lord. The sins of others ought to bewarnings to us not to tread in their steps. The murmurings of Israelwere written for our admonition. God is not subject to such passions aswe are; but he is very angry at sin and sinners. That certainly isevil, which deserves such a recompence; and his threatenings are assure as his promises. Let us be aware of the evils of our hearts, whichlead us to wander from the Lord. There is a rest ordained forbelievers, the rest of everlasting refreshment, begun in this life, andperfected in the life to come. This is the rest which God calls hisrest.
Psa 96:1-9	<br>When Christ finished his work on earth, and was received into his gloryin heaven, the church began to sing a new song unto him, and to blesshis name. His apostles and evangelists showed forth his salvation amongthe heathen, his wonders among all people. All the earth is heresummoned to worship the Lord. We must worship him in the beauty ofholiness, as God in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself.Glorious things are said of him, both as motives to praise and matterof praise.
Psa 96:10-13	<br>We are to hope and pray for that time, when Christ shall reign inrighteousness over all nations. He shall rule in the hearts of men, bythe power of truth, and the Spirit of righteousness. His coming drawsnigh; this King, this Judge standeth before the door, but he is not yetcome. The Lord will accept the praises of all who seek to promote thekingdom of Christ. The sea can but roar, and how the trees of the woodcan show that they rejoice we know not; but He that searches the heartknows what is the mind of the Spirit, and understands the words, thebroken language of the weakest. Christ will come to judge the earth, toexecute just vengeance on his enemies, and to fulfil his largestpromises to his people. What then are we? Would that day be welcome tous? If this be not our case, let us now begin to prepare to meet ourGod, by seeking the pardon of our sins, and the renewal of our souls toholiness.
Psa 97:1-7	<br>Though many have been made happy in Christ, still there is room. Andall have reason to rejoice in Christ's government. There is a depth inhis counsels, which we must not pretend to fathom; but stillrighteousness and judgment are the habitation of his throne. Christ'sgovernment, though it might be matter of joy to all, will yet be matterof terror to some; but it is their own fault that it is so. The mostresolute and daring opposition will be baffled at the presence of theLord. And the Lord Jesus will ere long come, and put an end to idolworship of every kind.
Psa 97:8-12	<br>The faithful servants of God may well rejoice and be glad, because heis glorified; and whatever tends to his honour, is his people'spleasure. Care is taken for their safety. But something more is meantthan their lives. The Lord will preserve the souls of his saints fromsin, from apostacy, and despair, under their greatest trials. He willdeliver them out of the hands of the wicked one, and preserve them safeto his heavenly kingdom. And those that rejoice in Christ Jesus, and inhis exaltation, have fountains of joy prepared for them. Those that sowin tears, shall reap in joy. Gladness is sure to the upright in heart;the joy of the hypocrite is but for a moment. Sinners tremble, butsaints rejoice at God's holiness. As he hates sin, yet freely loves theperson of the repentant sinner who believes in Christ, he will make afinal separation between the person he loves and the sin he hates, andsanctify his people wholly, body, soul, and spirit.
Psa 98:1-3	<br>A song of praise for redeeming love is a new song, a mystery hiddenfrom ages and generations. Converts sing a new song, very differentfrom what they had sung. If the grace of God put a new heart into ourbreasts, it will put a new song into our mouths. Let this new song besung to the praise of God, in consideration of the wonders he haswrought. The Redeemer has overcome all difficulties in the way of ourredemption, and was not discouraged by the services or sufferingsappointed him. Let us praise him for the discoveries made to the worldof the work of redemption; his salvation and his righteousnessfulfilling the prophecies and promises of the Old Testament. Inpursuance of this design, God raised up his Son Jesus to be not only aLight to lighten the Gentiles, but the glory of his people Israel.Surely it behoves us to inquire whether his holy arm hath gotten thevictory in our hearts, over the power of Satan, unbelief, and sin? Ifthis be our happy case, we shall exchange all light songs of vanity forsongs of joy and thanksgiving; our lives will celebrate the Redeemer'spraise.
Psa 98:4-9	<br>Let all the children of men rejoice in the setting up the kingdom ofChrist, for all may benefit by it. The different orders of rationalcreatures in the universe, seem to be described in figurative languagein the reign of the great Messiah. The kingdom of Christ will be ablessing to the whole creation. We expect his second coming to beginhis glorious reign. Then shall heaven and earth rejoice, and the joy ofthe redeemed shall be full. But sin and its dreadful effects will notbe utterly done away, till the Lord come to judge the world inrighteousness. Seeing then that we look for such things, let us givediligence that we may be found of him in peace, without spot, andblameless.
Psa 99:1-5	<br>God governs the world by his providence, governs the church by hisgrace, and both by his Son. The inhabitants of the earth have cause totremble, but the Redeemer still waits to be gracious. Let all who hear,take warning, and seek his mercy. The more we humble ourselves beforeGod, the more we exalt him; and let us be thus reverent, for he isholy.
Psa 99:6-9	<br>The happiness of Israel is made out by referring to the most usefulgovernors of that people. They in every thing made God's word and lawtheir rule, knowing that they could not else expect that their prayersshould be answered. They all wonderfully prevailed with God in prayer;miracles were wrought at their request. They pleaded for the people,and obtained answers of peace. Our Prophet and High Priest, ofinfinitely greater dignity than Moses, Aaron, or Samuel, has receivedand declared to us the will of the Father. Let us not only exalt theLord with our lips, but give him the throne in our heart; and while weworship him upon his mercy-seat, let us never forget that he is holy.
Psa 102:1-11	<br>The whole word of God is of use to direct us in prayer; but here, isoften elsewhere, the Holy Ghost has put words into our mouths. Here isa prayer put into the hands of the afflicted; let them present it toGod. Even good men may be almost overwhelmed with afflictions. It isour duty and interest to pray; and it is comfort to an afflicted spiritto unburden itself, by a humble representation of its griefs. We mustsay, Blessed be the name of the Lord, who both gives and takes away.The psalmist looked upon himself as a dying man; My days are like ashadow.
Psa 102:12-22	<br>We are dying creatures, but God is an everlasting God, the protector ofhis church; we may be confident that it will not be neglected. When weconsider our own vileness, our darkness and deadness, and the manifolddefects in our prayers, we have cause to fear that they will not bereceived in heaven; but we are here assured of the contrary, for wehave an Advocate with the Father, and are under grace, not under thelaw. Redemption is the subject of praise in the Christian church; andthat great work is described by the temporal deliverance andrestoration of Israel. Look down upon us, Lord Jesus; and bring us intothe glorious liberty of thy children, that we may bless and praise thyname.
Psa 102:23-28	<br>Bodily distempers soon weaken our strength, then what can we expect butthat our months should be cut off in the midst; and what should we dobut provide accordingly? We must own God's hand in it; and mustreconcile this to his love, for often those that have used theirstrength well, have it weakened; and those who, as we think, can veryill be spared, have their days shortened. It is very comfortable, inreference to all the changes and dangers of the church, to rememberthat Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, to-day, and for ever. And inreference to the death of our bodies, and the removal of friends, toremember that God is an everlasting God. Do not let us overlook theassurance this psalm contains of a happy end to all the believer'strials. Though all things are changing, dying, perishing, like avesture folding up and hastening to decay, yet Jesus lives, and thusall is secure, for he hath said, Because I live ye shall live also.
Psa 103:1-5	<br>By the pardon of sin, that is taken away which kept good things fromus, and we are restored to the favor of God, who bestows good things onus. Think of the provocation; it was sin, and yet pardoned: how manythe provocations, yet all pardoned! God is still forgiving, as we arestill sinning and repenting. The body finds the melancholy consequencesof Adam's offence, it is subject to many infirmities, and the soulalso. Christ alone forgives all our sins; it is he alone who heals allour infirmities. And the person who finds his sin cured, has awell-grounded assurance that it is forgiven. When God, by the gracesand comforts of his Spirit, recovers his people from their decays, andfills them with new life and joy, which is to them an earnest ofeternal life and joy, they may then be said to return to the days oftheir youth, Job 33:25.
Psa 103:6-14	<br>Truly God is good to all: he is in a special manner good to Israel. Hehas revealed himself and his grace to them. By his ways we mayunderstand his precepts, the ways he requires us to walk in; and hispromises and purposes. He always has been full of compassion. Howunlike are those to God, who take every occasion to chide, and neverknow when to cease! What would become of us, if God should deal so withus? The Scripture says a great deal of the mercy of God, and we allhave experienced it. The father pities his children that are weak inknowledge, and teaches them; pities them when they are froward, andbears with them; pities them when they are sick, and comforts them;pities them when they are fallen, and helps them to rise; pities themwhen they have offended, and, upon their submission, forgives them;pities them when wronged, and rights them: thus the Lord pities thosethat fear him. See why he pities. He considers the frailty of ourbodies, and the folly of our souls, how little we can do, how little wecan bear; in all which his compassion appears.
Psa 103:15-18	<br>How short is man's life, and uncertain! The flower of the garden iscommonly more choice, and will last the longer, for being sheltered bythe garden-wall, and the gardener's care; but the flower of the field,to which life is here compared, is not only withering in itself, butexposed to the cold blasts, and liable to be cropt and trod on by thebeasts of the field. Such is man. God considers this, and pities him;let him consider it himself. God's mercy is better than life, for itwill outlive it. His righteousness, the truth of his promise, shall beunto children's children, who tread in the footsteps of theirforefathers' piety. Then shall mercy be preserved to them.
Psa 103:19-22	<br>He who made all, rules all, and both by a word of power. He disposesall persons and things to his own glory. There is a world of holyangels who are ever praising him. Let all his works praise him. Suchwould have been our constant delight, if we had not been fallencreatures. Such it will in a measure become, if we are born of God.Such it will be for ever in heaven; nor can we be perfectly happy tillwe can take unwearied pleasure in perfect obedience to the will of ourGod. And let the feeling of each redeemed heart be, Bless the Lord, Omy soul.
Psa 104:1-9	<br>Every object we behold calls on us to bless and praise the Lord, who isgreat. His eternal power and Godhead are clearly shown by the thingswhich he hath made. God is light, and in him is no darkness at all. TheLord Jesus, the Son of his love, is the Light of the world.
Psa 104:10-18	<br>When we reflect upon the provision made for all creatures, we shouldalso notice the natural worship they render to God. Yet man, forgetfulungrateful man, enjoys the largest measure of his Creator's kindness.the earth, varying in different lands. Nor let us forget spiritualblessings; the fruitfulness of the church through grace, the bread ofeverlasting life, the cup of salvation, and the oil of gladness. DoesGod provide for the inferior creatures, and will he not be a refuge tohis people?
Psa 104:19-30	<br>We are to praise and magnify God for the constant succession of day andnight. And see how those are like to the wild beasts, who wait for thetwilight, and have fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness.Does God listen to the language of mere nature, even in ravenouscreatures, and shall he not much more interpret favourably the languageof grace in his own people, though weak and broken groanings whichcannot be uttered? There is the work of every day, which is to be donein its day, which man must apply to every morning, and which he mustcontinue in till evening; it will be time enough to rest when the nightcomes, in which no man can work. The psalmist wonders at the works ofGod. The works of art, the more closely they are looked upon, the morerough they appear; the works of nature appear more fine and exact. Theyare all made in wisdom, for they all answer the end they were designedto serve. Every spring is an emblem of the resurrection, when a newworld rises, as it were, out of the ruins of the old one. But man alonelives beyond death. When the Lord takes away his breath, his soulenters on another state, and his body will be raised, either to gloryor to misery. May the Lord send forth his Spirit, and new-create oursouls to holiness.
Psa 104:31-35	<br>Man's glory is fading; God's glory is everlasting: creatures change,but with the Creator there is no variableness. And if mediation on theglories of creation be so sweet to the soul, what greater glory appearsto the enlightened mind, when contemplating the great work ofredemption! There alone can a sinner perceive ground of confidence andjoy in God. While he with pleasure upholds all, governs all, andrejoices in all his works, let our souls, touched by his grace,meditate on and praise him.
Psa 105:1-7	<br>Our devotion is here stirred up, that we may stir up ourselves topraise God. Seek his strength; that is, his grace; the strength of hisSpirit to work in us that which is good, which we cannot do but bystrength derived from him, for which he will be sought. Seek to havehis favour to eternity, therefore continue seeking it while living inthis world; for he will not only be found, but he will reward thosethat diligently seek him.
Psa 105:8-23	<br>Let us remember the Redeemer's marvellous works, his wonders, and thejudgments of his mouth. Though true Christians are few number,strangers and pilgrims upon earth, yet a far better inheritance thanCanaan is made sure to them by the covenant of God; and if we have theanointing of the Holy Spirit, none can do us any harm. Afflictions areamong our mercies. They prove our faith and love, they humble ourpride, they wean us from the world, and quicken our prayers. Bread isthe staff which supports life; when that staff is broken, the bodyfails and sinks to the earth. The word of God is the staff of spirituallife, the food and support of the soul: the sorest judgment is a famineof hearing the word of the Lord. Such a famine was sore in all landswhen Christ appeared in the flesh; whose coming, and the blessed effectof it, are shadowed forth in the history of Joseph. At the appointedtime Christ was exalted as Mediator; all the treasures of grace andsalvation are at his disposal, perishing sinners come to him, and arerelieved by him.
Psa 105:24-45	<br>As the believer commonly thrives best in his soul when under the cross;so the church also flourishes most in true holiness, and increases innumber, while under persecution. Yet instruments shall be raised up fortheir deliverance, and plagues may be expected by persecutors. And seethe special care God took of his people in the wilderness. All thebenefits bestowed on Israel as a nation, were shadows of spiritualblessings with which we are blessed in Christ Jesus. Having redeemed uswith his blood, restored our souls to holiness, and set us at libertyfrom Satan's bondage, he guides and guards us all the way. He satisfiesour souls with the bread of heaven, and the water of life from the Rockof salvation, and will bring us safely to heaven. He redeems hisservants from all iniquity, and purifies them unto himself, to be apeculiar people, zealous of good works.
Psa 106:1-5	<br>None of our sins or sufferings should prevent our ascribing glory andpraise to the Lord. The more unworthy we are, the more is his kindnessto be admired. And those who depend on the Redeemer's righteousnesswill endeavour to copy his example, and by word and deed to show forthhis praise. God's people have reason to be cheerful people; and neednot envy the children of men their pleasure or pride.
Psa 106:6-12	<br>Here begins a confession of sin; for we must acknowledge that the Lordhas done right, and we have done wickedly. We are encouraged to hopethat though justly corrected, yet we shall not be utterly forsaken.God's afflicted people own themselves guilty before him. God isdistrusted because his favours are not remembered. If he did not saveus for his own name's sake, and to the praise of his power and grace,we should all perish.
Psa 106:13-33	<br>Those that will not wait for God's counsel, shall justly be given up totheir own hearts' lusts, to walk in their own counsels. An unduedesire, even for lawful things, becomes sinful. God showed hisdispleasure for this. He filled them with uneasiness of mind, terror ofconscience, and self-reproach. Many that fare deliciously every day,and whose bodies are healthful, have leanness in their souls: no loveto God, no thankfulness, no appetite for the Bread of life, and thenthe soul must be lean. Those wretchedly forget themselves, that feasttheir bodies and starve their souls. Even the true believer will seeabundant cause to say, It is of the Lord's mercies that I am notconsumed. Often have we set up idols in our hearts, cleaved to someforbidden object; so that if a greater than Moses had not stood to turnaway the anger of the Lord, we should have been destroyed. If God dealtseverely with Moses for unadvised words, what do those deserve whospeak many proud and wicked words? It is just in God to remove thoserelations that are blessings to us, when we are peevish and provokingto them, and grieve their spirits.
Psa 106:34-48	<br>The conduct of the Israelites in Canaan, and God's dealings with them,show that the way of sin is down-hill; omissions make way forcommissions: when they neglected to destroy the heathen, they learnedtheir works. One sin led to many more, and brought the judgments of Godon them. Their sin was, in part, their own punishment. Sinners oftensee themselves ruined by those who led them into evil. Satan, who is atempter, will be a tormentor. At length, God showed pity to his peoplefor his covenant's sake. The unchangeableness of God's merciful natureand love to his people, makes him change the course of justice intomercy; and no other change is meant by God's repentance. Our case isawful when the outward church is considered. When nations professingChristianity, are so guilty as we are, no wonder if the Lord bringsthem low for their sins. Unless there is general and deep repentance,there can be no prospect but of increasing calamities. The psalmconcludes with prayer for completing the deliverance of God's people,and praise for the beginning and progress of it. May all the people ofthe earth, ere long, add their Amen.
Psa 107:1-9	<br>In these verses there is reference to the deliverance from Egypt, andperhaps that from Babylon: but the circumstances of travellers in thosecountries are also noted. It is scarcely possible to conceive thehorrors suffered by the hapless traveller, when crossing the tracklesssands, exposed to the burning rays of the sum. The words describe theircase whom the Lord has redeemed from the bondage of Satan; who passthrough the world as a dangerous and dreary wilderness, often ready tofaint through troubles, fears, and temptations. Those who hunger andthirst after righteousness, after God, and communion with him, shall befilled with the goodness of his house, both in grace and glory.
Psa 107:10-16	<br>This description of prisoners and captives intimates that they aredesolate and sorrowful. In the eastern prisons the captives were andare treated with much severity. Afflicting providences must be improvedas humbling providences; and we lose the benefit, if our hearts areunhumbled and unbroken under them. This is a shadow of the sinner'sdeliverance from a far worse confinement. The awakened sinner discovershis guilt and misery. Having struggled in vain for deliverance, hefinds there is no help for him but in the mercy and grace of God. Hissin is forgiven by a merciful God, and his pardon is accompanied bydeliverance from the power of sin and Satan, and by the sanctifying andcomforting influences of God the Holy Spirit.
Psa 107:17-22	<br>If we knew no sin, we should know no sickness. Sinners are fools. Theyhurt their bodily health by intemperance, and endanger their lives byindulging their appetites. This their way is their folly. The weaknessof the body is the effect of sickness. It is by the power and mercy ofGod that we are recovered from sickness, and it is our duty to bethankful. All Christ's miraculous cures were emblems of his healingdiseases of the soul. It is also to be applied to the spiritual cureswhich the Spirit of grace works. He sends his word, and heals souls;convinces, converts them, makes them holy, and all by the word. Even incommon cases of recovery from sickness, God in his providence speaks,and it is done; by his word and Spirit the soul is restored to healthand holiness.
Psa 107:23-32	<br>Let those who go to sea, consider and adore the Lord. Mariners havetheir business upon the tempestuous ocean, and there witnessdeliverances of which others cannot form an idea. How seasonable it isat such a time to pray! This may remind us of the terrors and distressof conscience many experience, and of those deep scenes of troublewhich many pass through, in their Christian course. Yet, in answer totheir cries, the Lord turns their storm into a calm, and causes theirtrials to end in gladness.
Psa 107:33-43	<br>What surprising changes are often made in the affairs of men! Let thepresent desolate state of Judea, and of other countries, explain this.If we look abroad in the world, we see many greatly increase, whosebeginning was small. We see many who have thus suddenly risen, assuddenly brought to nothing. Worldly wealth is uncertain; often thosewho are filled with it, ere they are aware, lose it again. God has manyways of making men poor. The righteous shall rejoice. It shall fullyconvince all those who deny the Divine Providence. When sinners see howjustly God takes away the gifts they have abused, they will not have aword to say. It is of great use to us to be fully assured of God'sgoodness, and duly affected with it. It is our wisdom to mind our duty,and to refer our comfort to him. A truly wise person will treasure inhis heart this delightful psalm. From it, he will fully understand theweakness and wretchedness of man, and the power and loving-kindness ofGod, not for our merit, but for his mercy's sake.
Psa 109:1-5	<br>It is the unspeakable comfort of all believers, that whoever is againstthem, God is for them; and to him they may apply as to one pleased toconcern himself for them. David's enemies laughed at him for hisdevotion, but they could not laugh him out of it.
Psa 109:6-20	<br>The Lord Jesus may speak here as a Judge, denouncing sentence on someof his enemies, to warn others. When men reject the salvation ofChrist, even their prayers are numbered among their sins. See whathurries some to shameful deaths, and brings the families and estates ofothers to ruin; makes them and theirs despicable and hateful, andbrings poverty, shame, and misery upon their posterity: it is sin, thatmischievous, destructive thing. And what will be the effect of thesentence, "Go, ye cursed," upon the bodies and souls of the wicked! Howit will affect the senses of the body, and the powers of the soul, withpain, anguish, horror, and despair! Think on these things, sinners,tremble and repent.
Psa 109:21-31	<br>The psalmist takes God's comforts to himself, but in a very humblemanner. He was troubled in mind. His body was wasted, and almost wornaway. But it is better to have leanness in the body, while the soulprospers and is in health, than to have leanness in the soul, while thebody is feasted. He was ridiculed and reproached by his enemies. But ifGod bless us, we need not care who curses us; for how can they cursewhom God has not cursed; nay, whom he has blessed? He pleads God'sglory, and the honour of his name. Save me, not according to my merit,for I pretend to none, but according to thy-mercy. He concludes withthe joy of faith, in assurance that his present conflicts would end intriumphs. Let all that suffer according to the will of God, commit thekeeping of their souls to him. Jesus, unjustly put to death, and nowrisen again, is an Advocate and Intercessor for his people, ever readyto appear on their behalf against a corrupt world, and the greataccuser.
Psa 111:7,8). All God's commandments are sure; all have beenfulfilled by Christ, and remain with him for a rule of walk andconversation to us. He sent redemption unto his people, out of Egypt atfirst, and often afterwards; and these were typical of the greatredemption, which in the fulness of time was to be wrought out by theLord Jesus. Here his everlasting righteousness shines forth in unionwith his boundless mercy. No man is wise who does not fear the Lord; noman acts wisely except as influenced by that fear. This fear will leadto repentance, to faith in Christ, to watchfulness and obedience. Suchpersons are of a good understanding, however poor, unlearned, ordespised.	
Psa 115:1-8	<br>Let no opinion of our own merits have any place in our prayers or inour praises. All the good we do, is done by the power of his grace; andall the good we have, is the gift of his mere mercy, and he must haveall the praise. Are we in pursuit of any mercy, and wrestling with Godfor it, we must take encouragement in prayer from God only. Lord, do sofor us; not that we may have the credit and comfort of it, but thatthey mercy and truth may have the glory of it. The heathen gods aresenseless things. They are the works of men's hands: the painter, thecarver, the statuary, can put no life into them, therefore no sense.The psalmist hence shows the folly of the worshippers of idols.
Psa 115:9-18	<br>It is folly to trust in dead images, but it is wisdom to trust in theliving God, for he is a help and a shield to those that trust in him.Wherever there is right fear of God, there may be cheerful faith inhim; those who reverence his word, may rely upon it. He is ever foundfaithful. The greatest need his blessing, and it shall not be denied tothe meanest that fear him. God's blessing gives an increase, especiallyin spiritual blessings. And the Lord is to be praised: his goodness islarge, for he has given the earth to the children of men for their use.The souls of the faithful, after they are delivered from the burdens ofthe flesh, are still praising him; but the dead body cannot praise God:death puts an end to our glorifying him in this world of trial andconflict. Others are dead, and an end is thereby put to their service,therefore we will seek to do the more for God. We will not only do itourselves, but will engage others to do it; to praise him when we aregone. Lord, thou art the only object for faith and love. Help us topraise thee while living and when dying, that thy name may be the firstand last upon our lips: and let the sweet savour of thy name refreshour souls for ever.
Psa 116:1-9	<br>We have many reasons for loving the Lord, but are most affected by hisloving-kindness when relieved out of deep distress. When a poor sinneris awakened to a sense of his state, and fears that he must soon sinkunder the just wrath of God, then he finds trouble and sorrow. But letall such call upon the Lord to deliver their souls, and they will findhim gracious and true to his promise. Neither ignorance nor guilt willhinder their salvation, when they put their trust in the Lord. Let usall speak of God as we have found him; and have we ever found himotherwise than just and good? It is of his mercies that we are notconsumed. Let those who labour and are heavy laden come to him, thatthey may find rest to their souls; and if at all drawn from their rest,let them haste to return, remembering how bountifully the Lord hasdealt with them. We should deem ourselves bound to walk as in hispresence. It is a great mercy to be kept from being swallowed up withover-much sorrow. It is a great mercy for God to hold us by the righthand, so that we are not overcome and overthrown by a temptation. Butwhen we enter the heavenly rest, deliverance from sin and sorrow willbe complete; we shall behold the glory of the Lord, and walk in hispresence with delight we cannot now conceive.
Psa 116:10-19	<br>When troubled, we do best to hold our peace, for we are apt to speakunadvisedly. Yet there may be true faith where there are workings ofunbelief; but then faith will prevail; and being humbled for ourdistrust of God's word, we shall experience his faithfulness to it.What can the pardoned sinner, or what can those who have been deliveredfrom trouble or distress, render to the Lord for his benefits? Wecannot in any way profit him. Our best is unworthy of his acceptance;yet we ought to devote ourselves and all we have to his service. I willtake the cup of salvation; I will offer the drink-offerings appointedby the law, in token of thankfulness to God, and rejoice in God'sgoodness to me. I will receive the cup of affliction; that cup, thatbitter cup, which is sanctified to the saints, so that to them it is acup of salvation; it is a means of spiritual health. The cup ofconsolation; I will receive the benefits God bestows upon me, as fromhis hand, and taste his love in them, as the portion not only of mineinheritance in the other world, but of my cup in this. Let others servewhat masters they will, truly I am thy servant. Two ways men came to beservants. By birth. Lord, I was born in thy house; I am the son ofthine handmaid, and therefore thine. It is a great mercy to be childrenof godly parents. By redemption. Lord, thou hast loosed my bonds, thouhast discharged me from them, therefore I am thy servant. The bondsthou hast loosed shall tie me faster unto thee. Doing good issacrifice, with which God is well pleased; and this must accompanygiving thanks to his name. Why should we offer that to the Lord whichcost us nothing? The psalmist will pay his vows now; he will not delaythe payment: publicly, not to make a boast, but to show he is notashamed of God's service, and to invite others to join him. Such aretrue saints of God, in whose lives and deaths he will be glorified.
Psa 118:1-18	<br>The account the psalmist here gives of his troubles is very applicableto Christ: many hated him without a cause; nay, the Lord himselfchastened him sorely, bruised him, and put him to grief, that by hisstripes we might be healed. God is sometimes the strength of hispeople, when he is not their song; they have spiritual supports, thoughthey want spiritual delights. Whether the believer traces back hiscomfort to the everlasting goodness and mercy of God, or whether helooks forward to the blessing secured to him, he will find abundantcause for joy and praise. Every answer to our prayers is an evidencethat the Lord is on our side; and then we need not fear what man can dounto us; we should conscientiously do our duty to all, and trust in himalone to accept and bless us. Let us seek to live to declare the worksof God, and to encourage others to serve him and trust in him. Suchwere the triumphs of the Son of David, in the assurance that the goodpleasure of the Lord should prosper in his hand.
Psa 118:19-29	<br>Those who saw Christ's day at so great a distance, saw cause to praiseGod for the prospect. The prophecy, 
Psa 118:22,23), may refer toDavid's preferment; but principally to Christ. 1. His humiliation; heis the Stone which the builders refused: they would go on in theirbuilding without him. This proved the ruin of those who thus made lightof him. Rejecters of Christ are rejected of God. 2. His exaltation; heis the chief Cornerstone in the foundation. He is the chief Top-stone,in whom the building is completed, who must, in all things, have thepre-eminence. Christ's name is Wonderful; and the redemption he wroughtout is the most amazing of all God's wondrous works. We will rejoiceand be glad in the Lord's day; not only that such a day is appointed,but in the occasion of it, Christ's becoming the Head. Sabbath daysought to be rejoicing days, then they are to us as the days of heaven.Let this Saviour be my Saviour, my Ruler. Let my soul prosper and be inhealth, in that peace and righteousness which his government brings.Let me have victory over the lusts that war against my soul; and letDivine grace subdue my heart. The duty which the Lord has made, bringslight with it, true light. The duty this privilege calls for, is hereset forth; the sacrifices we are to offer to God in gratitude forredeeming love, are ourselves; not to be slain upon the altar, butliving sacrifices, to be bound to the altar; spiritual sacrifices ofprayer and praise, in which our hearts must be engaged. The psalmistpraises God, and calls upon all about him to give thanks to God for theglad tidings of great joy to all people, that there is a Redeemer, evenChrist the Lord. In him the covenant of grace is made sure andeverlasting.	
Psa 119:1-8	<br>This psalm may be considered as the statement of a believer'sexperience. As far as our views, desires, and affections agree withwhat is here expressed, they come from the influences of the HolySpirit, and no further. The pardoning mercy of God in Christ, is theonly source of a sinner's happiness. And those are most happy, who arepreserved most free from the defilement of sin, who simply believeGod's testimonies, and depend on his promises. If the heart be dividedbetween him and the world, it is evil. But the saints carefully avoidall sin; they are conscious of much evil that clogs them in the ways ofGod, but not of that wickedness which draws them out of those ways. Thetempter would make men think they are at them out of those ways. Thetempter would make men think they are at liberty to follow the word ofGod or not, as they please. But the desire and prayer of a good managree with the will and command of God. If a man expects by obediencein one thing to purchase indulgence for disobedience in others, hishypocrisy will be detected; if he is not ashamed in this world,everlasting shame will be his portion. The psalmist coveted to learnthe laws of God, to give God the glory. And believers see that if Godforsakes them, the temper will be too hard for them.
Psa 119:9-16	<br>To original corruption all have added actual sin. The ruin of the youngis either living by no rule at all, or choosing false rules: let themwalk by Scripture rules. To doubt of our own wisdom and strength, andto depend upon God, proves the purpose of holiness is sincere. God'sword is treasure worth laying up, and there is no laying it up safe butin our hearts, that we may oppose God's precepts to the dominion ofsin, his promises to its allurements, and his threatenings to itsviolence. Let this be our plea with Him to teach us his statutes, that,being partakers of his holiness, we may also partake of hisblessedness. And those whose hearts are fed with the bread of life,should with their lips feed many. In the way of God's commandmentsthere is the unsearchable riches of Christ. But we do not meditate onGod's precepts to good purpose, unless our good thoughts produce goodworks. I will not only think of thy statutes, but do them with delight.And it will be well to try the sincerity of our obedience by tracingthe spring of it; the reality of our love by cheerfulness in appointedduties.
Psa 119:17-24	<br>If God deals in strict justice with us, we all perish. We ought tospend our lives in his service; we shall find true life in keeping hisword. Those that would see the wondrous things of God's law and gospel,must beg him to give them understanding, by the light of his Spirit.Believers feel themselves strangers on earth; they fear missing theirway, and losing comfort by erring from God's commandments. Everysanctified soul hungers after the word of God, as food which there isno living without. There is something of pride at the bottom of everywilful sin. God can silence lying lips; reproach and contempt mayhumble and do us good, and then they shall be removed. Do we find theweight of the cross is above that we are able to bear? He that bore itfor us will enable us to bear it; upheld by him we cannot sink. It issad when those who should protect the innocent, are their betrayers.The psalmist went on in duty, and he found comfort in the word of God.The comforts of the word of God are most pleasant to a gracious soul,when other comforts are made bitter; and those that would have God'stestimonies to be their delight, must be advised by them. May the Lorddirect us in exercising repentance of sin, and faith in Christ.
Psa 119:25-32	<br>While the souls of the children of this world cleave to the earth astheir portion, the children of light are greatly burdened, because ofthe remains of carnal affections in their hearts. It is unspeakablecomfort to a gracious soul, to think with what tenderness all itscomplaints are received by a gracious God. We can talk of the wondersof redeeming love, when we understand the way of God's precepts, andwalk in that way. The penitent melts in sorrow for sin: even thepatient spirit may melt in the sense of affliction, it is then itsinterest to pour out its soul before God. The way of lying means allfalse ways by which men deceive themselves and others, or are deceivedby Satan and his instruments. Those who know and love the law of theLord, desire to know it more, and love it better. The way of seriousgodliness is the way of truth; the only true way to happiness: we mustalways have actual regard to it. Those who stick to the word of God,may in faith expect and pray for acceptance with God. Lord, never leaveme to do that by which I shall shame myself, and do not thou reject myservices. Those that are going to heaven, should still press forward.God, by his Spirit, enlarges the hearts of his people when he givesthem wisdom. The believer prays to be set free from sin.
Psa 119:33-40	<br>Teach me thy statutes, not the mere words, but the way of applying themto myself. God, by his Spirit, gives a right understanding. But theSpirit of revelation in the word will not suffice, unless we have theSpirit of wisdom in the heart. God puts his Spirit within us, causingus to walk in his statutes. The sin here prayed against iscovetousness. Those that would have the love of God rooted in them,must get the love of the world rooted out; for the friendship of theworld is enmity with God. Quicken me in thy way; to redeem time, and todo every duty with liveliness of spirit. Beholding vanity deadens us,and slackens our pace; a traveller must not stand gazing upon everyobject that presents itself to his view. The promises of God's wordgreatly relate to the preservation of the true believer. When Satan hasdrawn a child of God into worldly compliances, he will reproach himwith the falls into which he led him. Victory must come from the crossof Christ. When we enjoy the sweetness of God's precepts, it will makeus long for more acquaintance with them. And where God has wrought towill, he will work to do.
Psa 119:41-48	<br>Lord, I have by faith thy mercies in view; let me by prayer prevail toobtain them. And when the salvation of the saints is completed, it willplainly appear that it was not in vain to trust in God's word. We needto pray that we may never be afraid or ashamed to own God's truths andways before men. And the psalmist resolves to keep God's law, in aconstant course of obedience, without backsliding. The service of sinis slavery; the service of God is liberty. There is no full happiness,or perfect liberty, but in keeping God's law. We must never be ashamedor afraid to own our religion. The more delight we take in the serviceof God, the nearer we come to perfection. Not only consent to his lawas good, but take pleasure in it as good for us. Let me put forth allthe strength I have, to do it. Something of this mind of Christ is inevery true disciple.
Psa 119:49-56	<br>Those that make God's promises their portion, may with humble boldnessmake them their plea. He that by his Spirit works faith in us, willwork for us. The word of God speaks comfort in affliction. If, throughgrace, it makes us holy, there is enough in it to make us easy, in allconditions. Let us be certain we have the Divine law for what webelieve, and then let not scoffers prevail upon us to decline from it.God's judgments of old comfort and encourage us, for he is still thesame. Sin is horrible in the eyes of all that are sanctified. Ere longthe believer will be absent from the body, and present with the Lord.In the mean time, the statutes of the Lord supply subjects for gratefulpraise. In the season of affliction, and in the silent hours of thenight, he remembers the name of the Lord, and is stirred up to keep thelaw. All who have made religion the first thing, will own that theyhave been unspeakable gainers by it.
Psa 119:57-64	<br>True believers take the Lord for the portion of their inheritance, andnothing less will satisfy them. The psalmist prayed with his wholeheart, knowing how to value the blessing he prayed for: he desired themercy promised, and depended on the promise for it. He turned fromby-paths, and returned to God's testimonies. He delayed not. It behovessinners to hasten to escape; and the believer will be equally in hasteto glorify God. No care or grief should take away God's word out of ourminds, or hinder the comfort it bestows. There is no situation on earthin which a believer has not cause to be thankful. Let us feel ashamedthat others are more willing to keep from sleep to spend the time insinful pleasures, than we are to praise God. And we should be moreearnest in prayer, that our hearts may be filled with his mercy, grace,and peace.
Psa 119:65-72	<br>However God has dealt with us, he has dealt with us better than wedeserve; and all in love, and for our good. Many have knowledge, butlittle judgment; those who have both, are fortified against the snaresof Satan, and furnished for the service of God. We are most apt towander from God, when we are easy in the world. We should leave ourconcerns to the disposal of God, seeing we know not what is good forus. Lord, thou art our bountiful Benefactor; incline our hearts tofaith and obedience. The psalmist will go on in his duty with constancyand resolution. The proud are full of the world, and its wealth andpleasures; these make them senseless, secure, and stupid. God visitshis people with affliction, that they may learn his statutes. Not onlyGod's promises, but even his law, his percepts, though hard to ungodlymen, are desirable, and profitable, because they lead us with safetyand delight unto eternal life.
Psa 119:73-80	<br>God made us to serve him, and enjoy him; but by sin we have madeourselves unfit to serve him, and to enjoy him. We ought, therefore,continually to beseech him, by his Holy Spirit, to give usunderstanding. The comforts some have in God, should be matter of joyto others. But it is easy to own, that God's judgments are right, untilit comes to be our own case. All supports under affliction must comefrom mercy and compassion. The mercies of God are tender mercies; themercies of a father, the compassion of a mother to her son. They cometo us when we are not able to go to them. Causeless reproach does nothurt, and should not move us. The psalmist could go on in the way ofhis duty, and find comfort in it. He valued the good will of saints,and was desirous to keep up his communion with them. Soundness of heartsignifies sincerity in dependence on God, and devotedness to him.
Psa 119:81-88	<br>The psalmist sought deliverance from his sins, his foes, and his fears.Hope deferred made him faint; his eyes failed by looking out for thisexpected salvation. But when the eyes fail, yet faith must not. Hisaffliction was great. He was become like a leathern bottle, which, ifhung up in the smoke, is dried and shrivelled up. We must ever bemindful of God's statutes. The days of the believer's mourning shall beended; they are but for a moment, compared with eternal happiness. Hisenemies used craft as well as power for his ruin, in contempt of thelaw of God. The commandments of God are true and faithful guides in thepath of peace and safety. We may best expect help from God when, likeour Master, we do well and suffer for it. Wicked men may almost consumethe believer upon earth, but he would sooner forsake all than forsakethe word of the Lord. We should depend upon the grace of God forstrength to do every good work. The surest token of God's good-willtoward us, is his good work in us.
Psa 119:89-96	<br>The settling of God's word in heaven, is opposed to the changes andrevolutions of the earth. And the engagements of God's covenant areestablished more firmly than the earth itself. All the creatures answerthe ends of their creation: shall man, who alone is endued with reason,be the only unprofitable burden of the earth? We may make the Bible apleasant companion at any time. But the word, without the grace of God,would not quicken us. See the best help for bad memories, namely, goodaffections; and though the exact words be lost, if the meaning remain,that is well. I am thine, not my own, not the world's; save me fromsin, save me from ruin. The Lord will keep the man in peace, whose mindis stayed on him. It is poor perfection which one sees and end of. Suchare all things in this world, which pass for perfections. The glory ofman is but as the flower of the grass. The psalmist had seen thefulness of the word of God, and its sufficiency. The word of the Lordreaches to all cases, to all times. It will take us from all confidencein man, or in our own wisdom, strength, and righteousness. Thus shallwe seek comfort and happiness from Christ alone.
Psa 119:97-104	<br>What we love, we love to think of. All true wisdom is from God. A goodman carries his Bible with him, if not in his hands, yet in his headand in his heart. By meditation on God's testimonies we understand morethan our teachers, when we understand our own hearts. The written wordis a more sure guide to heaven, than all the fathers, the teachers, andancients of the church. We cannot, with any comfort or boldness, attendGod in holy duties, while under guilt, or in any by-way. It was Divinegrace in his heart, that enabled the psalmist to receive theseinstructions. The soul has its tastes as well as the body. Our relishfor the word of God will be greatest, when that for the world and theflesh is least. The way of sin is a wrong way; and the moreunderstanding we get by the precepts of God, the more rooted will beour hatred of sin; and the more ready we are in the Scriptures, thebetter furnished we are with answers to temptation.
Psa 119:105-112	<br>The word of God directs us in our work and way, and a dark place indeedthe world would be without it. The commandment is a lamp kept burningwith the oil of the Spirit, as a light to direct us in the choice ofour way, and the steps we take in that way. The keeping of God'scommands here meant, was that of a sinner under a dispensation ofmercy, of a believer having part in the covenant of grace. The psalmistis often afflicted; but with longing desires to become more holy,offers up daily prayers for quickening grace. We cannot offer any thingto God, that he will accept but what he is pleased to teach us to do.To have our soul or life continually in our hands, implies constantdanger of life; yet he did not forget God's promises nor his precepts.Numberless are the snares laid by the wicked; and happy is that servantof God, whom they have not caused to err from his Master's precepts.Heavenly treasures are a heritage for ever; all the saints accept themas such, therefore they can be content with little of this world. Wemust look for comfort only in the way of duty, and that duty must bedone. A good man, by the grace of God, brings his heart to his work,then it is done well.
Psa 119:113-120	<br>Here is a dread of the risings of sin, and the first beginnings of it.The more we love the law of God, the more watchful we shall be, lestvain thoughts draw us from what we love. Would we make progress inkeeping God's commands, we must be separate from evil-doers. Thebeliever could not live without the grace of God; but, supported by hishand, his spiritual life shall be maintained. Our holy security isgrounded on Divine supports. All departure from God's statutes iserror, and will prove fatal. Their cunning is falsehood. There is a daycoming which will put the wicked into everlasting fire, the fit placefor the dross. See what comes of sin Surely we who fall so low indevout affections, should fear, lest a promise being left us ofentering into heavenly rest, any of us should be found to come short ofit, Heb 4:1.
Psa 119:121-128	<br>Happy is the man, who, acting upon gospel principles, does justice toall around. Christ our Surety, having paid our debt and ransom, securesall the blessings of salvation to every true believer. The psalmistexpects the word of God's righteousness, and no other salvation thanwhat is secured by that word, which cannot fall to the ground. Wedeserve no favour form God; we are most easy when we cast ourselvesupon God's mercy, and refer ourselves to it. If any man resolve to doGod's will as his servant, he shall be made to know his testimonies. Wemust do what we can for the support of religion, and, after all, mustbeg of God to take the work into his own hands. It is hypocrisy to saywe love God's commandments more than our worldly interests. The way ofsin is a false way, being directly contrary to God's precepts, whichare right: those that love and esteem God's law, hate sin, and will notbe reconciled to it.
Psa 119:129-136	<br>The wonders of redeeming love will fix the heart in adoration of them.The Scriptures show us what we were, what we are, and what we shall be.They show us the mercy and the justice of the Lord, the joys of heaven,and the pains of hell. Thus they give to the simple, in a few days,understanding of those matters, which philosophers for ages sought invain. The believer, wearied with the cares of life and his conflictswith sin, pants for the consolations conveyed to him by means of thesacred word. And every one may pray, Look thou upon me, and be mercifulunto me as thou usest to do unto those that love thy name. We must begthat the Holy Spirit would order our steps. The dominion of sin is tobe dreaded and prayed against by every one. The oppression of men isoften more than flesh and blood can bear; and He who knoweth our frame,will not refuse to remove it in answer to the prayers of his people.Whatever obscurity may appear as to the faith of the Old Testamentbelievers, their confidence at the throne of grace can only beexplained by their having obtained more distinct views of gospelprivileges, through the sacrifices and services of their law, than isgenerally imagined. Go to the same place, plead the name and merits ofJesus, and you will not, you cannot plead in vain. Commonly, wherethere is a gracious heart, there is a weeping eye. Accept, O Lord, thetears our blessed Redeemer shed in the days of his flesh, for us whoshould weep for our brethren or ourselves.
Psa 119:137-144	<br>God never did, and never can do wrong to any. The promises arefaithfully performed by Him that made them. Zeal against sin shouldconstrain us to do what we can against it, at least to do more inreligion ourselves. Our love to the word of God is evidence of our loveto God, because it is designed to make us partake his holiness. Men'sreal excellency always makes them low in their own eyes. When we aresmall and despised, we have the more need to remember God's precepts,that we may have them to support us. The law of God is the truth, thestandard of holiness, the rule of happiness; but the obedience ofChrist alone justifies the believer. Sorrows are often the lot ofsaints in this vale of tears; they are in heaviness through manifoldtemptations. There are delights in the word of God, which the saintsoften most sweetly enjoy when in trouble and anguish. This is lifeeternal, to know God and Jesus Christ whom he has sent, Joh 17:3. Maywe live the life of faith and grace here, and be removed to the life ofglory hereafter.
Psa 119:145-152	<br>Supplications with the whole heart are presented only by those whodesire God's salvation, and who love his commandments. Whither shouldthe child go but to his father? Save me from my sins, my corruptions,my temptations, all the hinderances in my way, that I may keep thytestimonies. Christians who enjoy health, should not suffer the earlyhours of the morning to glide away unimproved. Hope in God's wordencourages us to continue in prayer. It is better to take time fromsleep, than not to find time for prayer. We have access to God at allhours; and if our first thoughts in the morning are of God, they willhelp to keep us in his fear all the day long. Make me lively andcheerful. God knows what we need and what is good for us, and willquicken us. If we are employed in God's service, we need not fear thosewho try to set themselves as far as they can out of the reach of theconvictions and commands of his law. When trouble is near, God is near.He is never far to seek. All his commandments are truth. And God'spromises will be performed. All that ever trusted in God have found himfaithful.
Psa 119:153-160	<br>The closer we cleave to the word of God, both as our rule and as ourstay, the more assurance we have of deliverance. Christ is the Advocateof his people, their Redeemer. Those who were quickened by his Spiritand grace, when they were dead in trespasses and sins, often need tohave the work of grace revived in them, according to the word ofpromise. The wicked not only do not God's statutes, but they do noteven seek them. They flatter themselves that they are going to heaven;but the longer they persist in sin, the further it is from them. God'smercies are tender; they are a fountain that can never be exhausted.The psalmist begs for God's reviving, quickening grace. A man, steadyin the way of his duty, though he may have many enemies, needs to fearnone. Those that hate sin truly, hate it as sin, as a transgression ofthe law of God, and a breaking of his word. Our obedience is onlypleasing to God, and pleasant to ourselves, when it comes from aprinciple of love. All, in every age, who receive God's word in faithand love, find every saying in it faithful.
Psa 119:161-168	<br>Those whose hearts stand in awe of God's word, will rather endure thewrath of man, than break the law of God. By the word of God we areunspeakable gainers. Every man hates to have a lie told him, but weshould more hate telling a lie; by the latter we give an affront toGod. The more we see the beauty of truth, the more we shall see thehateful deformity of a lie. We are to praise God even for afflictions;through grace we get good from them. Those that love the world havegreat vexation, for it does not answer what they expect; those thatlove God's word have great peace, for it outdoes what they expect.Those in whom this holy love reigns, will not perplex themselves withneedless scruples, or take offence at their brethren. A good hope ofsalvation will engage the heart in doing the commandments. And our loveto the word of God must subdue our lusts, and root out carnalaffections: we must make heart work of it, or we make nothing of it. Wemust keep the commandments of God by obedience to them, and hispromises by reliance on them. God's eye is on us at all times; thisshould make us very careful to keep his commandments.
Psa 119:169-176	<br>The psalmist desired grace and strength to lift up his prayers, andthat the Lord would receive and notice them. He desired to know more ofGod in Christ; to know more of the doctrines of the word, and theduties of religion. He had a deep sense of unworthiness, and holy fearthat his prayer should not come before God; Lord, what I pray for is,what thou hast promised. We have learned nothing to purpose, if we havenot learned to praise God. We should always make the word of God therule of our discourse, so as never to transgress it by sinful speaking,or sinful silence. His own hands are not sufficient, nor can anycreature lend him help; therefore he looks up to God, that the handthat had made him may help him. He had made religion his deliberatechoice. There is an eternal salvation all the saints long for, andtherefore they pray that God would help their way to it. Let thyjudgments help me; let all ordinances and all providences, (both areGod's judgments,) further me in glorifying God; let them help me forthat work. He often looks back with shame and gratitude to his lostestate. He still prays for the tender care of Him who purchased hisflock with his own blood, that he may receive from him the gift ofeternal life. Seek me, that is, Find me; for God never seeks in vain.Turn me, and I shall be turned. Let this psalm be a touchstone by whichto try our hearts, and our lives. Do our hearts, cleansed in Christ'sblood, make these prayers, resolutions and confessions our own? IsGod's word the standard of our faith, and the law of our practice? Dowe use it as pleas with Christ for what we need? Happy those who livein such delightful exercises.
Psa 120:1-4	<br>The psalmist was brought into great distress by a deceitful tongue. Mayevery good man be delivered from lying lips. They forged false chargesagainst him. In this distress, he sought God by fervent prayer. God canbridle their tongues. He obtained a gracious answer to this prayer.Surely sinners durst not act as they do, if they knew, and would bepersuaded to think, what will be in the end thereof. The terrors of theLord are his arrows; and his wrath is compared to burning coals ofjuniper, which have a fierce heat, and keep fire very long. This is theportion of the false tongue; for all that love and make a lie, shallhave their portion in the lake that burns eternally.
Psa 120:5-7	<br>It is very grievous to a good man, to be cast into, and kept in thecompany of the wicked, from whom he hopes to be for ever separated. Seehere the character of a good man; he is for living peaceably with allmen. And let us follow David as he prefigured Christ; in our distresslet us cry unto the Lord, and he will hear us. Let us follow afterpeace and holiness, striving to overcome evil with good.
Psa 122:1-5	<br>The pleasure and profit from means of grace, should make us disregardtrouble and fatigue in going to them; and we should quicken one anotherto what is good. We should desire our Christian friends, when they haveany good work in hand, to call for us, and take us with them. With whatreadiness should we think of the heavenly Jerusalem! How cheerfullyshould we bear the cross and welcome death, in hopes of a crown ofglory! Jerusalem is called the beautiful city. It was a type of thegospel church, which is compact together in holy love and Christiancommunion, so that it is all as one city. If all the disciples ofChrist were of one mind, and kept the unity of the Spirit in the bondof peace, their enemies would be deprived of their chief advantagesagainst them. But Satan's maxim always has been, to divide that he mayconquer; and few Christians are sufficiently aware of his designs.
Psa 122:6-9	<br>Those who can do nothing else for the peace of Jerusalem, may pray forit. Let us consider all who seek the glory of the Redeemer, as ourbrethren and fellow-travellers, without regarding differences which donot affect our eternal welfare. Blessed Spirit of peace and love, whodidst dwell in the soul of the holy Jesus, descend into his church, andfill those who compose it with his heavenly tempers; cause bittercontentions to cease, and make us to be of one mind. Love of thebrethren and love to God, ought to stir us up to seek to be like theLord Jesus in fervent prayer and unwearied labour, for the salvation ofmen, and the Divine glory.
Psa 124:1-5	<br>God suffers the enemies of his people sometimes to prevail very faragainst them, that his power may be seen the more in their deliverance.Happy the people whose God is Jehovah, a God all-sufficient. Besidesapplying this to any particular deliverance wrought in our days and theancient times, we should have in our thoughts the great work ofredemption by Jesus Christ, by which believers were rescued from Satan.
Psa 124:6-8	<br>God is the Author of all our deliverances, and he must have the glory.The enemies lay snares for God's people, to bring them into sin andtrouble, and to hold them there. Sometimes they seem to prevail; but inthe Lord let us put our trust, and we shall not be put to confusion.The believer will ascribe all the honour of his salvation, to thepower, mercy, and truth of God, and look back with wonder andthanksgiving on the way in which the Lord has led him. Let us rejoicethat our help for the time to come is in him who made heaven and earth.
Psa 125:1-3	<br>All those minds shall be truly stayed, that are stayed on God. Theyshall be as Mount Zion, firm as it is; a mountain supported byprovidence, much more as a holy mountain supported by promise. Theycannot be removed from confidence in God. They abide for ever in thatgrace which is the earnest of their everlasting continuance in glory.Committing themselves to God, they shall be safe from their enemies.Even mountains may moulder and come to nothing, and rocks be removed,but God's covenant with his people cannot be broken, nor his care ofthem cease. Their troubles shall last no longer than their strengthwill bear them up under them. The rod of the wicked may come, may fallupon the righteous, upon their persons, their estates, their liberties,their families names, on any thing that falls to their lot; only itcannot reach their souls. And though it may come upon their lot, itshall not rest thereon. The Lord will make all work together for theirgood. The wicked shall only prove a correcting rod, not a destroyingsword; even this rod shall not remain upon them, lest they distrust thepromise, thinking God has cast them off.
Psa 125:4,5	<br>God's promises should quicken our prayers. The way of holiness isstraight; there are no windings or shiftings in it. But the ways ofsinners are crooked. They shift from one purpose to another, and turnhither and thither to deceive; but disappointment and misery shallbefal them. Those who cleave to the ways of God, though they may havetrouble in their way, their end shall be peace. The pleading of theirSaviour for them, secures to them the upholding power and preservinggrace of their God. Lord, number us with them, in time, and toeternity.
Psa 126:1-3	<br>It is good to observe how God's deliverances of the church are for us,that we may rejoice in them. And how ought redemption from the wrath tocome, from the power of sin and of Satan, to be valued! The sinnerconvinced of his guilt and danger, when by looking to a crucifiedSaviour he receives peace to his conscience, and power to break off hissins, often can scarcely believe that the prospect which opens to himis a reality.
Psa 126:4-6	<br>The beginnings of mercies encourage us to pray for the completion ofthem. And while we are in this world there will be matter for prayer,even when we are most furnished with matter for praise. Sufferingsaints are often in tears; they share the calamities of human life, andcommonly have a greater share than others. But they sow in tears; theydo the duty of an afflicted state. Weeping must not hinder sowing; wemust get good from times of affliction. And they that sow, in the tearsof godly sorrow, to the Spirit, shall of the Spirit reap lifeeverlasting; and that will be a joyful harvest indeed. Blessed arethose that mourn, for they shall be for ever comforted. When we mournfor our sins, or suffer for Christ's sake, we are sowing in tears, toreap in joy. And remember that God is not mocked; for whatever a mansoweth that shall he reap, Ga 6:7-9. Here, O disciple of Jesus, beholdan emblem of thy present labour and future reward; the day is comingwhen thou shalt reap in joy, plentiful shall be thy harvest, and greatshall be thy joy in the Lord.
Psa 129:1-4	<br>The enemies of God's people have very barbarously endeavoured to wearout the saints of the Most High. But the church has been alwaysgraciously delivered. Christ has built his church upon a rock. And theLord has many ways of disabling wicked men from doing the mischief theydesign against his church. The Lord is righteous in not sufferingIsrael to be ruined; he has promised to preserve a people to himself.
Psa 129:5-8	<br>While God's people shall flourish as the loaded palm-tree, or the greenand fruitful olive, their enemies shall wither as the grass upon thehouse-tops, which in eastern countries are flat, and what grows therenever ripens; so it is with the designs of God's enemies. No wise manwill pray the Lord to bless these mowers or reapers. And when weremember how Jesus arose and reigns; how his people have beensupported, like the burning but unconsumed bush, we shall not fear.
Psa 130:1-4	<br>The only way of relief for a sin-entangled soul, is by applying to Godalone. Many things present themselves as diversions, many things offerthemselves as remedies, but the soul finds that the Lord alone canheal. And until men are sensible of the guilt of sin, and quit all tocome at once to God, it is in vain for them to expect any relief. TheHoly Ghost gives to such poor souls a fresh sense of their deepnecessity, to stir them up in earnest applications, by the prayer offaith, by crying to God. And as they love their souls, as they areconcerned for the glory of the Lord, they are not to be wanting in thisduty. Why is it that these matters are so long uncertain with them? Isit not from sloth and despondency that they content themselves withcommon and customary applications to God? Then let us up and be doing;it must be done, and it is attended with safety. We are to humbleourselves before God, as guilty in his sight. Let us acknowledge oursinfulness; we cannot justify ourselves, or plead not guilty. It is ourunspeakable comfort that there is forgiveness with him, for that iswhat we need. Jesus Christ is the great Ransom; he is ever an Advocatefor us, and through him we hope to obtain forgiveness. There isforgiveness with thee, not that thou mayest be presumed upon, but thatthou mayest be feared. The fear of God often is put for the wholeworship of God. The only motive and encouragement for sinners is this,that there is forgiveness with the Lord.
Psa 130:5-8	<br>It is for the Lord that my soul waits, for the gifts of his grace, andthe working of his power. We must hope for that only which he haspromised in his word. Like those who wish to see the dawn, being verydesirous that light would come long before day; but still moreearnestly does a good man long for the tokens of God's favour, and thevisits of his grace. Let all that devote themselves to the Lord,cheerfully stay themselves on him. This redemption is redemption fromall sin. Jesus Christ saves his people from their sins, both from thecondemning and from the commanding power of sin. It is plenteousredemption; there is an all-sufficient fulness in the Redeemer, enoughfor all, enough for each; therefore enough for me, says the believer.Redemption from sin includes redemption from all other evils, thereforeit is a plenteous redemption, through the atoning blood of Jesus, whoshall redeem his people from all their sins. All that wait on God formercy and grace, are sure to have peace.
Psa 132:1-10	<br>David bound himself to find a place for the Lord, for the ark, thetoken of God's presence. When work is to be done for the Lord, it isgood to tie ourselves to a time. It is good in the morning to fix uponwork for the day, with submission to Providence, for we know not what aday may bring forth. And we should first, and without delay, seek tohave our own hearts made a habitation of God through the Spirit. Heprays that God would take up his dwelling in the habitation he hadbuilt; that he would give grace to the ministers of the sanctuary to dotheir duty. David pleads that he was the anointed of the Lord, and thishe pleads as a type of Christ, the great Anointed. We have no merit ofour own to plead; but, for His sake, in whom there is a fulness ofmerit, let us find favour. And every true believer in Christ, is ananointed one, and has received from the Holy One the oil of true grace.The request is, that God would not turn away, but hear and answer theirpetitions for his Son's sake.
Psa 132:11-18	<br>The Lord never turns from us when we plead the covenant with hisanointed Prophet, Priest, and King. How vast is the love of God to man,that he should speak thus concerning his church! It is his desire todwell with us; yet how little do we desire to dwell with him! He abodein Zion till the sins of Israel caused him to give them up to thespoilers. Forsake us not, O God, and deliver us not in like manner,sinful though we are. God's people have a special blessing on commonenjoyments, and that blessing puts peculiar sweetness into them. Zion'spoor have reason to be content with a little of this world, becausethey have better things prepared for them. God will abundantly blessthe nourishment of the new man, and satisfy the poor in spirit with thebread of life. He gives more than we ask, and when he gives salvation,he will give abundant joy. God would bring to nothing every designformed to destroy the house of David, until King Messiah should ariseout of it, to sit upon the throne of his Father. In him all thepromises centre. His enemies, who will not have him to reign over them,shall at the last day be clothed with shame and confusion for ever.
Psa 135:1-4	<br>The subject-matter of praise, is the blessings of grace flowing fromthe everlasting love of God. The name of God as a covenant God andFather in Christ, blessing us with all spiritual blessings in him, isto be loved and praised. The Lord chose a people to himself, that theymight be unto him for a name and a praise. If they do not praise himfor this distinguishing favour, they are the most unworthy andungrateful of all people.
Psa 135:5-14	<br>God is, and will be always, the same to his church, a gracious,faithful, wonder-working God. And his church is, and will be, the sameto him, a thankful, praising people: thus his name endures for ever. Hewill return in ways of mercy to them, and will delight to do them good.
Psa 135:15-21	<br>These verses arm believers against idolatry and all false worship, byshowing what sort of gods the heathen worshipped. And the moredeplorable the condition of the Gentile nations that worship idols, themore are we to be thankful that we know better. Let us pity, and prayfor, and seek to benefit benighted heathens and deluded sinners. Let usendeavour to glorify his name, and recommend his truth, not only withour lips, but by holy lives, copying the example of Christ's goodnessand truth.
Psa 136:1-9	<br>Forgetful as we are, things must be often repeated to us. By "mercy" weunderstand the Lord's disposition to save those whom sin has renderedmiserable and vile, and all the provision he has made for theredemption of sinners by Jesus Christ. The counsels of this mercy havebeen from everlasting, and the effects of it will endure for ever, toall who are interested in it. The Lord continues equally ready to showmercy to all who seek for it, and this is the source of all our hopeand comfort.
Psa 136:10-22	<br>The great things God did for Israel, when he brought them out of Egypt,were mercies which endured long to them; and our redemption by Christ,which was typified thereby, endures for ever. It is good to enter intothe history of God's favours, and in each to observe, and own, that hismercy endureth for ever. He put them in possession of a good land; itwas a figure of the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ.
Psa 136:23-26	<br>God's everlasting mercy is here praised for the redemption of hischurch; in all his glories, and all his gifts. Blessed be God, who hasprovided and made known to us salvation through his Son. May we knowand feel his redeeming power, that we may serve him in righteousnessall our days. May He who giveth food to all flesh, feed our souls untoeternal life, and enliven our affections by his grace, that we may givethanks and praise to his holy name, for his mercy endureth for ever.Let us trace up all the favours we receive to this true source, andoffer praise continually.
Psa 137:1-4	<br>Their enemies had carried the Jews captive from their own land. Tocomplete their woes, they insulted over them; they required of themmirth and a song. This was very barbarous; also profane, for no songswould serve but the songs of Zion. Scoffers are not to be compiledwith. They do not say, How shall we sing, when we are so much insorrow? but, It is the Lord's song, therefore we dare not sing it amongidolaters.
Psa 137:5-9	<br>What we love, we love to think of. Those that rejoice in God, for hissake make Jerusalem their joy. They stedfastly resolved to keep up thisaffection. When suffering, we should recollect with godly sorrow ourforfeited mercies, and our sins by which we lost them. If temporaladvantages ever render a profession, the worst calamity has befallenhim. Far be it from us to avenge ourselves; we will leave it to Him whohas said, Vengeance is mine. Those that are glad at calamities,especially at the calamities of Jerusalem, shall not go unpunished. Wecannot pray for promised success to the church of God without lookingto, though we do not utter a prayer for, the ruin of her enemies. Butlet us call to mind to whose grace and finished salvation alone it is,that we have any hopes of being brought home to the heavenly Jerusalem.
Psa 138:1-5	<br>When we can praise God with our whole heart, we need not be unwillingfor the whole world to witness our gratitude and joy in him. Those whorely on his loving-kindness and truth through Jesus Christ, will everfind him faithful to his word. If he spared not his own Son, how shallhe not with him freely give us all things? If God gives us strength inour souls, to bear the burdens, resist the temptations, and to do theduties of an afflicted state, if he strengthens us to keep hold ofhimself by faith, and to wait with patience for the event, we are boundto be thankful.
Psa 138:6-8	<br>Though the Lord is high, yet he has respect to every lowly, humbledsinner; but the proud and unbelieving will be banished far from hisblissful presence. Divine consolations have enough in them to reviveus, even when we walk in the midst of troubles. And God will save hisown people that they may be revived by the Holy Spirit, the Giver oflife and holiness. If we give to God the glory of his mercy, we maytake to ourselves the comfort. This confidence will not do away, butquicken prayer. Whatever good there is in us, it is God works in usboth to will and to do. The Lord will perfect the salvation of everytrue believer, and he will never forsake those whom he has created anewin Christ Jesus unto good works.
Psa 139:1-6	<br>God has perfect knowledge of us, and all our thoughts and actions areopen before him. It is more profitable to meditate on Divine truths,applying them to our own cases, and with hearts lifted to God inprayer, than with a curious or disputing frame of mind. That God knowsall things, is omniscient; that he is every where, is omnipresent; aretruths acknowledged by all, yet they are seldom rightly believed in bymankind. God takes strict notice of every step we take, every rightstep and every by step. He knows what rule we walk by, what end we walktoward, what company we walk with. When I am withdrawn from allcompany, thou knowest what I have in my heart. There is not a vainword, not a good word, but thou knowest from what thought it came, andwith what design it was uttered. Wherever we are, we are under the eyeand hand of God. We cannot by searching find how God searches us out;nor do we know how we are known. Such thoughts should restrain us fromsin.
Psa 139:7-16	<br>We cannot see God, but he can see us. The psalmist did not desire to gofrom the Lord. Whither can I go? In the most distant corners of theworld, in heaven, or in hell, I cannot go out of thy reach. No veil canhide us from God; not the thickest darkness. No disguise can save anyperson or action from being seen in the true light by him. Secrethaunts of sin are as open before God as the most open villanies. On theother hand, the believer cannot be removed from the supporting,comforting presence of his Almighty Friend. Should the persecutor takehis life, his soul will the sooner ascend to heaven. The grave cannotseparate his body from the love of his Saviour, who will raise it aglorious body. No outward circumstances can separate him from his Lord.While in the path of duty, he may be happy in any situation, by theexercise of faith, hope, and prayer.
Psa 139:17-24	<br>God's counsels concerning us and our welfare are deep, such as cannotbe known. We cannot think how many mercies we have received from him.It would help to keep us in the fear of the Lord all the day long, if,when we wake in the morning, our first thoughts were of him: and howshall we admire and bless our God for his precious salvation, when weawake in the world of glory! Surely we ought not to use our members andsenses, which are so curiously fashioned, as instruments ofunrighteousness unto sin. But our immortal and rational souls are astill more noble work and gift of God. Yet if it were not for hisprecious thoughts of love to us, our reason and our living for everwould, through our sins, prove the occasion of our eternal misery. Howshould we then delight to meditate on God's love to sinners in JesusChrist, the sum of which exceeds all reckoning! Sin is hated, andsinners lamented, by all who fear the Lord. Yet while we shun them weshould pray for them; with God their conversion and salvation arepossible. As the Lord knows us thoroughly, and we are strangers toourselves, we should earnestly desire and pray to be searched andproved by his word and Spirit. if there be any wicked way in me, let mesee it; and do thou root it out of me. The way of godliness is pleasingto God, and profitable to us; and will end in everlasting life. It isthe good old way. All the saints desire to be kept and led in this way,that they may not miss it, turn out of it, or tire in it.
Psa 140:1-7	<br>The more danger appears, the more earnest we should be in prayer toGod. All are safe whom the Lord protects. If he be for us, who can beagainst us? We should especially watch and pray, that the Lord wouldhold up our goings in his ways, that our footsteps slip not. God is asable to keep his people from secret fraud as from open force; and theexperience we have had of his power and care, in dangers of one kind,may encourage us to depend upon him in other dangers.
Psa 140:8-13	<br>Believers may pray that God would not grant the desires of the wicked,nor further their evil devices. False accusers will bring mischief uponthemselves, even the burning coals of Divine vengeance. And surely therighteous shall dwell in God's presence, and give him thanks forevermore. This is true thanksgiving, even thanks-living: this use weshould make of all our deliverances, we should serve God the moreclosely and cheerfully. Those who, though evil spoken of and ill-usedby men, are righteous in the sight of God, being justified by therighteousness of Christ, which is imputed to them, and received byfaith, as the effect of which, they live soberly and righteously; thesegive thanks to the Lord, for the righteousness whereby they are maderighteous, and for every blessing of grace, and mercy of life.
Psa 141:1-4	<br>Make haste unto me. Those that know how to value God's graciouspresence, will be the more fervent in their prayers. When presentedthrough the sacrifice and intercession of the Saviour, they will be asacceptable to God as the daily sacrifices and burnings of incense wereof old. Prayer is a spiritual sacrifice, it is the offering up the souland its best affections. Good men know the evil of tongue sins. Whenenemies are provoking, we are in danger of speaking unadvisedly. Whilewe live in an evil world, and have such evil hearts, we have need topray that we may neither be drawn nor driven to do any thing sinful.Sinners pretend to find dainties in sin; but those that consider howsoon sin will turn into bitterness, will dread such dainties, and prayto God to take them out of their sight, and by his grace to turn theirhearts against them. Good men pray against the sweets of sin.
Psa 141:5-10	<br>We should be ready to welcome the rebuke of our heavenly Father, andalso the reproof of our brethren. It shall not break my head, if it maybut help to break my heart: we must show that we take it kindly. Thosewho slighted the word of God before, will be glad of it when inaffliction, for that opens the ear to instruction. When the world isbitter, the word is sweet. Let us lift our prayer unto God. Let usentreat him to rescue us from the snares of Satan, and of all theworkers of iniquity. In language like this psalm, O Lord, would weentreat that our poor prayers should set forth our only hope, our onlydependence on thee. Grant us thy grace, that we may be prepared forthis employment, being clothed with thy righteousness, and having allthe gifts of thy Spirit planted in our hearts.
Psa 143:1-6	<br>We have no righteousness of our own to plead, therefore must pleadGod's righteousness, and the word of promise which he has freely givenus, and caused us to hope in. David, before he prays for the removal ofhis trouble, prays for the pardon of his sin, and depends upon mercyalone for it. He bemoans the weight upon his mind from outwardtroubles. But he looks back, and remembers God's former appearance forhis afflicted people, and for him in particular. He looks round, andnotices the works of God. The more we consider the power of God, theless we shall fear the face or force of man. He looks up with earnestdesires towards God and his favour. This is the best course we cantake, when our spirits are overwhelmed. The believer will not forget,that in his best actions he is a sinner. Meditation and prayer willrecover us from distresses; and then the mourning soul strives toreturn to the Lord as the infant stretches out its hands to theindulgent mother, and thirsts for his consolations as the parchedground for refreshing rain.
Psa 143:7-12	<br>David prays that God would be well pleased with him, and let him knowthat he was so. He pleads the wretchedness of his case, if God withdrewfrom him. But the night of distress and discouragement shall end in amorning of consolation and praise. He prays that he might beenlightened with the knowledge of God's will; and this is the firstwork of the Spirit. A good man does not ask the way in which is themost pleasant walking, but what is the right way. Not only show me whatthy will is, but teach me how to do it. Those who have the Lord fortheir God, have his Spirit for their Guide; they are led by the Spirit.He prays that he might be enlivened to do God's will. But we shouldespecially seek the destruction of our sins, our worst enemies, that wemay be devotedly God's servants.
Psa 144:1-8	<br>When men become eminent for things as to which they have had fewadvantages, they should be more deeply sensible that God has been theirTeacher. Happy those to whom the Lord gives that noblest victory,conquest and dominion over their own spirits. A prayer for furthermercy is fitly begun with a thanksgiving for former mercy. There was aspecial power of God, inclining the people of Israel to be subject toDavid; it was typical of the bringing souls into subjection to the LordJesus. Man's days have little substance, considering how many thoughtsand cares of a never-dying soul are employed about a poor dying body.Man's life is as a shadow that passes away. In their highest earthlyexaltation, believers will recollect how mean, sinful, and vile theyare in themselves; thus they will be preserved from self-importance andpresumption. God's time to help his people is, when they are sinking,and all other helps fail.
Psa 144:9-15	<br>Fresh favours call for fresh returns of thanks; we must praise God forthe mercies we hope for by his promise, as well as those we havereceived by his providence. To be saved from the hurtful sword, or fromwasting sickness, without deliverance from the dominion of sin and thewrath to come, is but a small advantage. The public prosperity Daviddesired for his people, is stated. It adds much to the comfort andhappiness of parents in this world, to see their children likely to dowell. To see them as plants, not as weeds, not as thorns; to see themas plants growing, not withered and blasted; to see them likely tobring forth fruit unto God in their day; to see them in their youthgrowing strong in the Spirit. Plenty is to be desired, that we may bethankful to God, generous to our friends, and charitable to the poor;otherwise, what profit is it to have our garners full? Also,uninterrupted peace. War brings abundance of mischiefs, whether it beto attack others or to defend ourselves. And in proportion as we do notadhere to the worship and service of God, we cease to be a happypeople. The subjects of the Saviour, the Son of David, share theblessings of his authority and victories, and are happy because theyhave the Lord for their God.
Psa 145:1-9	<br>Those who, under troubles and temptations, abound in fervent prayer,shall in due season abound in grateful praise, which is the truelanguage of holy joy. Especially we should speak of God's wondrous workof redemption, while we declare his greatness. For no deliverance ofthe Israelites, nor the punishment of sinners, so clearly proclaims thejustice of God, as the cross of Christ exhibits it to the enlightenedmind. It may be truly said of our Lord Jesus Christ, that his words arewords of goodness and grace; his works are works of goodness and grace.He is full of compassion; hence he came into the world to save sinners.When on earth, he showed his compassion both to the bodies and souls ofmen, by healing the one, and making wise the other. He is of greatmercy, a merciful High Priest, through whom God is merciful to sinners.
Psa 145:10-21	<br>All God's works show forth his praises. He satisfies the desire ofevery living thing, except the unreasonable children of men, who aresatisfied with nothing. He does good to all the children of men; hisown people in a special manner. Many children of God, who have beenready to fall into sin, to fall into despair, have tasted his goodnessin preventing their falls, or recovering them speedily by his gracesand comforts. And with respect to all that are heavy laden under theburden of sin, if they come to Christ by faith, he will ease them, hewill raise them. He is very ready to hear and answer the prayers of hispeople. He is present every where; but in a special way he is nigh tothem, as he is not to others. He is in their hearts, and dwells thereby faith, and they dwell in him. He is nigh to those that call uponhim, to help them in all times of need. He will be nigh to them, thatthey may have what they ask, and find what they seek, if they call uponhim in truth and sincerity. And having taught men to love his name andholy ways, he will save them from the destruction of the wicked. May wethen love his name, and walk in his ways, while we desire that allflesh should bless his holy name for ever and ever.
Psa 146:1-4	<br>If it is our delight to praise the Lord while we live, we shallcertainly praise him to all eternity. With this glorious prospectbefore us, how low do worldly pursuits seem! There is a Son of man inwhom there is help, even him who is also the Son of God, who will notfail those that trust in him. But all other sons of men are like theman from whom they sprung, who, being in honour, did not abide. God hasgiven the earth to the children of men, but there is great strivingabout it. Yet, after a while, no part of the earth will be their own,except that in which their dead bodies are laid. And when man returnsto his earth, in that very day all his plans and designs vanish and aregone: what then comes of expectations from him?
Psa 146:5-10	<br>The psalmist encourages us to put confidence in God. We must hope inthe providence of God for all we need as to this life, and in the graceof God for that which is to come. The God of heaven became a man thathe might become our salvation. Though he died on the cross for oursins, and was laid in the grave, yet his thoughts of love to us did notperish; he rose again to fulfil them. When on earth, his miracles wereexamples of what he is still doing every day. He grants deliverance tocaptives bound in the chains of sin and Satan. He opens the eyes of theunderstanding. He feeds with the bread of life those who hunger forsalvation; and he is the constant Friend of the poor in spirit, thehelpless: with him poor sinners, that are as fatherless, find mercy;and his kingdom shall continue for ever. Then let sinners flee to him,and believers rejoice in him. And as the Lord shall reign for ever, letus stir up each other to praise his holy name.
Psa 147:1-11	<br>Praising God is work that is its own wages. It is comely; it becomes usas reasonable creatures, much more as people in covenant with God. Hegathers outcast sinners by his grace, and will bring them into his holyhabitation. To those whom God heals with the consolations of hisSpirit, he speaks peace, assures them their sins are pardoned. And forthis, let others praise him also. Man's knowledge is soon ended; butGod's knowledge is a dept that can never be fathomed. And while hetelleth the number of the stars, he condescends to hear thebroken-hearted sinner. While he feeds the young ravens, he will notleave his praying people destitute. Clouds look dull and melancholy,yet without them we could have no rain, therefore no fruit. Thusafflictions look black and unpleasant; but from clouds of afflictioncome showers that make the soul to yield the peaceable fruits ofrighteousness. The psalmist delights not in things wherein sinnerstrust and glory; but a serious and suitable regard to God is, in hissight, of very great price. We are not to be in doubt between hope andfear, but to act under the gracious influences of hope and fear united.
Psa 147:12-20	<br>The church, like Jerusalem of old, built up and preserved by thewisdom, power, and goodness of God, is exhorted to praise him for allthe benefits and blessings vouchsafed to her; and these are representedby his favours in the course of nature. The thawing word may representthe gospel of Christ, and the thawing wind the Spirit of Christ; forthe Spirit is compared to the wind, Joh 3:8. Converting grace softensthe heart that was hard frozen, and melts it into tears of repentance,and makes good reflections to flow, which before were chilled andstopped up. The change which the thaw makes is very evident, yet how itis done no one can say. Such is the change wrought in the conversion ofa soul, when God's word and Spirit are sent to melt it and restore itto itself.
Psa 148:1-6	<br>We, in this dark and sinful world, know little of the heavenly world oflight. But we know that there is above us a world of blessed angels.They are always praising God, therefore the psalmist shows his desirethat God may be praised in the best manner; also we show that we havecommunion with spirits above, who are still praising him. The heavens,with all contained in them, declare the glory of God. They call on us,that both by word and deed, we glorify with them the Creator andRedeemer of the universe.
Psa 148:7-14	<br>Even in this world, dark and bad as it is, God is praised. The powersof nature, be they ever so strong, so stormy, do what God appointsthem, and no more. Those that rebel against God's word, show themselvesto be more violent than even the stormy winds, yet they fulfil it. Viewthe surface of the earth, mountains and all hills; from the barren topsof some, and the fruitful tops of others, we may fetch matter forpraise. And assuredly creatures which have the powers of reason, oughtto employ themselves in praising God. Let all manner of persons praiseGod. Those of every rank, high and low. Let us show that we are hissaints by praising his name continually. He is not only our Creator,but our Redeemer; who made us a people near unto him. We may by "theHorn of his people" understand Christ, whom God has exalted to be aPrince and a Saviour, who is indeed the defence and the praise of allhis saints, and will be so for ever. In redemption, that unspeakableglory is displayed, which forms the source of all our hopes and joys.May the Lord pardon us, and teach our hearts to love him more andpraise him better.
Psa 149:1-5	<br>New mercies continually demand new songs of praise, upon earth and inheaven. And the children of Zion have not only to bless the God whomade them, but to rejoice in him, as having created them in ChristJesus unto good works, and formed them saints as well as men. The Lordtakes pleasure in his people; they should rejoice in Him. When the Lordhas made sinners feel their wants and unworthiness, he will adorn themwith the graces of his Spirit, and cause them to bear his image, andrejoice in his happiness for ever. Let his saints employ their wakinghours upon their beds in songs of praise. Let them rejoice, even uponthe bed of death, assured that they are going to eternal rest andglory.
Psa 149:6-9	<br>Some of God's servants of old were appointed to execute vengeanceaccording to his word. They did not do it from personal revenge orearthly politics, but in obedience to God's command. And the honourintended for all the saints of God, consists in their triumphs over theenemies of their salvation. Christ never intended his gospel should bespread by fire and sword, or his righteousness by the wrath of man. Butlet the high praises of God be in our mouths, while we wield the swordof the word of God, with the shield of faith, in warfare with theworld, the flesh, and the devil. The saints shall be more thanconquerors over the enemies of their souls, through the blood of theLamb and the word of his testimony. The completing of this will be inthe judgement of the great day. Then shall the judgement be executed.Behold Jesus, and his gospel church, chiefly in her millennial state.He and his people rejoice in each other; by their prayers and effortsthey work with him, while he goes forth in the chariots of salvation,conquering sinners by grace, or in chariots of vengeance, to destroyhis enemies.
Pro 1:1-6	<br>The lessons here given are plain, and likely to benefit those who feeltheir own ignorance, and their need to be taught. If young people takeheed to their ways, according to Solomon's Proverbs, they will gainknowledge and discretion. Solomon speaks of the most important pointsof truth, and a greater than Solomon is here. Christ speaks by his wordand by his Spirit. Christ is the Word and the Wisdom of God, and he ismade to us wisdom.
Pro 1:7-9	<br>Fools are persons who have no true wisdom, who follow their owndevices, without regard to reason, or reverence for God. Children arereasonable creatures, and when we tell them what they must do, we musttell them why. But they are corrupt and wilful, therefore with theinstruction there is need of a law. Let Divine truths and commands beto us most honourable; let us value them, and then they shall be so tous.
Pro 1:10-19	<br>Wicked people are zealous in seducing others into the paths of thedestroyer: sinners love company in sin. But they have so much the moreto answer for. How cautious young people should be! "Consent thou not."Do not say as they say, nor do as they do, or would have thee to do;have no fellowship with them. Who could think that it should be apleasure to one man to destroy another! See their idea of worldlywealth; but it is neither substance, nor precious. It is the ruinousmistake of thousands, that they overvalue the wealth of this world. Menpromise themselves in vain that sin will turn to their advantage. Theway of sin is down-hill; men cannot stop themselves. Would young peopleshun temporal and eternal ruin, let them refuse to take one step inthese destructive paths. Men's greediness of gain hurries them uponpractices which will not suffer them or others to live out half theirdays. What is a man profited, though he gain the world, if he lose hislife? much less if he lose his soul?
Pro 1:20-33	<br>Solomon, having showed how dangerous it is to hearken to thetemptations of Satan, here declares how dangerous it is not to hearkento the calls of God. Christ himself is Wisdom, is Wisdoms. Three sortsof persons are here called by Him: 1. Simple ones. Sinners are fond oftheir simple notions of good and evil, their simple prejudices againstthe ways of God, and flatter themselves in their wickedness. 2.Scorners. Proud, jovial people, that make a jest of every thing.Scoffers at religion, that run down every thing sacred and serious. 3.Fools. Those are the worst of fools that hate to be taught, and have arooted dislike to serious godliness. The precept is plain; Turn you atmy reproof. We do not make a right use of reproofs, if we do not turnfrom evil to that which is good. The promises are very encouraging. Mencannot turn by any power of their own; but God answers, Behold, I willpour out my Spirit unto you. Special grace is needful to sincereconversion. But that grace shall never be denied to any who seek it.The love of Christ, and the promises mingled with his reproofs, surelyshould have the attention of every one. It may well be asked, how longmen mean to proceed in such a perilous path, when the uncertainty oflife and the consequences of dying without Christ are considered? Nowsinners live at ease, and set sorrow at defiance; but their calamitywill come. Now God is ready to hear their prayers; but then they shallcry in vain. Are we yet despisers of wisdom? Let us hearken diligently,and obey the Lord Jesus, that we may enjoy peace of conscience andconfidence in God; be free from evil, in life, in death, and for ever.
Pro 2:1-9	<br>Those who earnestly seek heavenly wisdom, will never complain that theyhave lost their labour; and the freeness of the gift does not do awaythe necessity of our diligence, Joh 6:27 Let them seek, and they shallfind it; let them ask, and it shall be given them. Observe who are thusfavoured. They are the righteous, on whom the image of God is renewed,which consists in righteousness. If we depend upon God, and seek to himfor wisdom, he will enable us to keep the paths of judgment.
Pro 2:10-22	<br>If we are truly wise, we shall be careful to avoid all evil company andevil practices. When wisdom has dominion over us, then it not onlyfills the head, but enters into the heart, and will preserve, bothagainst corruptions within and temptations without. The ways of sin areways of darkness, uncomfortable and unsafe: what fools are those wholeave the plain, pleasant, lightsome paths of uprightness, to walk insuch ways! They take pleasure in sin; both in committing it, and inseeing others commit it. Every wise man will shun such company. Truewisdom will also preserve from those who lead to fleshly lusts, whichdefile the body, that living temple, and war against the soul. Theseare evils which excite the sorrow of every serious mind, and causeevery reflecting parent to look upon his children with anxiety, lestthey should be entangled in such fatal snares. Let the sufferings ofothers be our warnings. Our Lord Jesus deters from sinful pleasures, bythe everlasting torments which follow them. It is very rare that anywho are caught in this snare of the devil, recover themselves; so muchis the heart hardened, and the mind blinded, by the deceitfulness ofthis sin. Many think that this caution, besides the literal sense, isto be understood as a caution against idolatry, and subjecting the soulto the body, by seeking any forbidden object. The righteous must leavethe earth as well as the wicked; but the earth is a very differentthing to them. To the wicked it is all the heaven they ever shall have;to the righteous it is the place of preparation for heaven. And is itall one to us, whether we share with the wicked in the miseries oftheir latter end, or share those everlasting joys that shall crownbelievers?
Pro 3:1-6	<br>In the way of believing obedience to God's commandments health andpeace may commonly be enjoyed; and though our days may not be long uponearth, we shall live for ever in heaven. Let not mercy and truthforsake thee; God's mercy in promising, and his truth in performing:live up to them, keep up thine interest in them, and take the comfortof them. We must trust in the Lord with all our hearts, believing he isable and wise to do what is best. Those who know themselves, find theirown understandings a broken reed, which, if they lean upon, will fail.Do not design any thing but what is lawful, and beg God to direct theein every case, though it may seem quite plain. In all our ways thatprove pleasant, in which we gain our point, we must acknowledge Godwith thankfulness. In all our ways that prove uncomfortable, and thatare hedged up with thorns, we must acknowledge him with submission. Itis promised, He shall direct thy paths; so that thy way shall be safeand good, and happy at last.
Pro 3:7-12	<br>There is not a greater enemy to the fear of the Lord in the heart, thanself-conceit of our own wisdom. The prudence and sobriety whichreligion teaches, tend not only to the health of the soul, but to thehealth of the body. Worldly wealth is but poor substance, yet, such asit is, we must honour God with it; and those that do good with whatthey have, shall have more to do more good with. Should the Lord visitus with trials and sickness, let us not forget that the exhortationspeaks to us as to children, for our good. We must not faint under anaffliction, be it ever so heavy and long, not be driven to despair, oruse wrong means for relief. The father corrects the son whom he loves,because he loves him, and desires that he may be wise and good.Afflictions are so far from doing God's children any hurt, that, by thegrace of God, they promote their holiness.
Pro 3:13-20	<br>No precious jewels or earthly treasures are worthy to be compared withtrue wisdom, whether the concerns of time or eternity be considered. Wemust make wisdom our business; we must venture all in it, and bewilling to part with all for it. This Wisdom is the Lord Jesus Christand his salvation, sought and obtained by faith and prayer. Were it notfor unbelief, remaining sinfulness, and carelessness, we should findall our ways pleasantness, and our paths peace, for his are so; but wetoo often step aside from them, to our own hurt and grief. Christ isthat Wisdom, by whom the worlds were made, and still are in being;happy are those to whom he is made of God wisdom. He has wherewithal tomake good all his promises.
Pro 3:21-26	<br>Let us not suffer Christ's words to depart from us, but keep soundwisdom and discretion; then shall we walk safely in his ways. Thenatural life, and all that belongs to it, shall be under the protectionof God's providence; the spiritual life, and all its interests, underthe protection of his grace, so that we shall be kept from falling intosin or trouble.
Pro 3:27-35	<br>Our business is to observe the precepts of Christ, and to copy hisexample; to do justice, to love mercy, and to beware of covetousness;to be ready for every good work, avoiding needless strife, and bearingevils, if possible, rather than seeking redress by law. It will befound there is little got by striving. Let us not envy prosperousoppressors; far be it from the disciples of Christ to choose any oftheir ways. These truths may be despised by the covetous and luxurious,but everlasting contempt will be the portion of such scorners, whileDivine favour is shown to the humble believer.
Pro 4:1-13	<br>We must look upon our teachers as our fathers: though instruction carryin it reproof and correction, bid it welcome. Solomon's parents lovedhim, therefore taught him. Wise and godly men, in every age of theworld, and rank in society, agree that true wisdom consists inobedience, and is united to happiness. Get wisdom, take pains for it.Get the rule over thy corruptions; take more pains to get this than thewealth of this world. An interest in Christ's salvation is necessary.This wisdom is the one thing needful. A soul without true wisdom andgrace is a dead soul. How poor, contemptible, and wretched are those,who, with all their wealth and power, die without gettingunderstanding, without Christ, without hope, and without God! Let usgive heed to the sayings of Him who has the words of eternal life. Thusour path will be plain before us: by taking, and keeping fast hold ofinstruction, we shall avoid being straitened or stumbling.
Pro 4:14-27	<br>The way of evil men may seem pleasant, and the nearest way to compasssome end; but it is an evil way, and will end ill; if thou love thy Godand thy soul, avoid it. It is not said, Keep at a due distance, but ata great distance; never think you can get far enough from it. The wayof the righteous is light; Christ is their Way, and he is the Light.The saints will not be perfect till they reach heaven, but there theyshall shine as the sun in his strength. The way of sin is as darkness.The way of the wicked is dark, therefore dangerous; they fall into sin,but know not how to avoid it. They fall into trouble, but never seek toknow wherefore God contends with them, nor what will be in the end ofit. This is the way we are bid to shun. Attentive hearing the word ofGod, is a good sign of a work of grace begun in the heart, and a goodmeans of carrying it on. There is in the word of God a proper remedyfor all diseases of the soul. Keep thy heart with all diligence. Wemust set a strict guard upon our souls; keep our hearts from doinghurt, and getting hurt. A good reason is given; because out of it arethe issues of life. Above all, we should seek from the Lord Jesus thatliving water, the sanctifying Spirit, issuing forth unto everlastinglife. Thus we shall be enabled to put away a froward mouth and perverselips; our eyes will be turned from beholding vanity, looking straightforward, and walking by the rule of God's word, treading in the stepsof our Lord and Master. Lord, forgive the past, and enable us to followthee more closely for the time to come.
Pro 5:1-14	<br>Solomon cautions all young men, as his children, to abstain fromfleshly lusts. Some, by the adulterous woman, here understand idolatry,false doctrine, which tends to lead astray men's minds and manners; butthe direct view is to warn against seventh-commandment sins. Oftenthese have been, and still are, Satan's method of drawing men from theworship of God into false religion. Consider how fatal theconsequences; how bitter the fruit! Take it any way, it wounds. Itleads to the torments of hell. The direct tendency of this sin is tothe destruction of body and soul. We must carefully avoid every thingwhich may be a step towards it. Those who would be kept from harm, mustkeep out of harm's way. If we thrust ourselves into temptation we mockGod when we pray, Lead us not into temptation. How many mischiefsattend this sin! It blasts the reputation; it wastes time; it ruins theestate; it is destructive to health; it will fill the mind with horror.Though thou art merry now, yet sooner or later it will bring sorrow.The convinced sinner reproaches himself, and makes no excuse for hisfolly. By the frequent acts of sin, the habits of it become rooted andconfirmed. By a miracle of mercy true repentance may prevent thedreadful consequences of such sins; but this is not often; far more dieas they have lived. What can express the case of the self-ruined sinnerin the eternal world, enduring the remorse of his conscience!
Pro 5:15-23	<br>Lawful marriage is a means God has appointed to keep from thesedestructive vices. But we are not properly united, except as we attendto God's word, seeking his direction and blessing, and acting withaffection. Ever remember, that though secret sins may escape the eyesof our fellow-creatures, yet a man's ways are before the eyes of theLord, who not only sees, but ponders all his goings. Those who are sofoolish as to choose the way of sin, are justly left of God tothemselves, to go on in the way to destruction.
Pro 6:1-5	<br>If we live as directed by the word of God, we shall find it profitableeven in this present world. We are stewards of our worldly substance,and have to answer to the Lord for our disposal of it; to waste it inrash schemes, or such plans as may entangle us in difficulties andtemptations, is wrong. A man ought never to be surety for more than heis able and willing to pay, and can afford to pay, without wronging hisfamily; he ought to look upon every sum he is engaged for, as his owndebt. If we must take all this care to get our debts to men forgiven,much more to obtain forgiveness with God. Humble thyself to him, makesure of Christ as thy Friend, to plead for thee; pray earnestly thatthy sins may be pardoned, and that thou mayest be kept from going downto the pit.
Pro 6:6-11	<br>Diligence in business is every man's wisdom and duty; not so much thathe may attain worldly wealth, as that he may not be a burden to others,or a scandal to the church. The ants are more diligent than slothfulmen. We may learn wisdom from the meanest insects, and be shamed bythem. Habits of indolence and indulgence grow upon people. Thus liferuns to waste; and poverty, though at first at a distance, graduallydraws near, like a traveller; and when it arrives, is like an armedman, too strong to be resisted. All this may be applied to the concernsof our souls. How many love their sleep of sin, and their dreams ofworldly happiness! Shall we not seek to awaken such? Shall we not givediligence to secure our own salvation?
Pro 6:12-19	<br>If the slothful are to be condemned, who do nothing, much more thosethat do all the ill they can. Observe how such a man is described. Hesays and does every thing artfully, and with design. His ruin shallcome without warning, and without relief. Here is a list of thingshateful to God. Those sins are in a special manner provoking to God,which are hurtful to the comfort of human life. These things which Godhates, we must hate in ourselves; it is nothing to hate them in others.Let us shun all such practices, and watch and pray against them; andavoid, with marked disapproval, all who are guilty of them, whatevermay be their rank.
Pro 6:20-35	<br>The word of God has something to say to us upon all occasions. Let notfaithful reproofs ever make us uneasy. When we consider how much thissin abounds, how heinous adultery is in its own nature, of what evilconsequence it is, and how certainly it destroys the spiritual life inthe soul, we shall not wonder that the cautions against it are so oftenrepeated. Let us notice the subjects of this chapter. Let us rememberHim who willingly became our Surety, when we were strangers andenemies. And shall Christians, who have such prospects, motives, andexamples, be slothful and careless? Shall we neglect what is pleasingto God, and what he will graciously reward? May we closely watch everysense by which poison can enter our minds or affections.
Pro 7:1-5	<br>We must lay up God's commandments safely. Not only, Keep them, and youshall live; but, Keep them as those that cannot live without them.Those that blame strict and careful walking as needless and tooprecise, consider not that the law is to be kept as the apple of theeye; indeed the law in the heart is the eye of the soul. Let the wordof God dwell in us, and so be written where it will be always at handto be read. Thus we shall be kept from the fatal effects of our ownpassions, and the snares of Satan. Let God's word confirm our dread ofsin, and resolutions against it.
Pro 7:6-27	<br>Here is an affecting example of the danger of youthful lusts. It is ahistory or a parable of the most instructive kind. Will any one dare toventure on temptations that lead to impurity, after Solomon has setbefore his eyes in so lively and plain a manner, the danger of evengoing near them? Then is he as the man who would dance on the edge of alofty rock, when he has just seen another fall headlong from the sameplace. The misery of self-ruined sinners began in disregard to God'sblessed commands. We ought daily to pray that we may be kept fromrunning into temptation, else we invite the enemies of our souls tospread snares for us. Ever avoid the neighbourhood of vice. Beware ofsins which are said to be pleasant sins. They are the more dangerous,because they most easily gain the heart, and close it againstrepentance. Do nothing till thou hast well considered the end of it.Were a man to live as long as Methuselah, and to spend all his days inthe highest delights sin can offer, one hour of the anguish andtribulation that must follow, would far outweigh them.
Pro 8:1-11	<br>The will of God is made known by the works of creation, and by theconsciences of men, but more clearly by Moses and the prophets. Thechief difficulty is to get men to attend to instruction. Yet attentionto the words of Christ, will guide the most ignorant into savingknowledge of the truth. Where there is an understanding heart, andwillingness to receive the truth in love, wisdom is valued above silverand gold.
Pro 8:12-21	<br>Wisdom, here is Christ, in whom are all the treasures of wisdom andknowledge; it is Christ in the word, and Christ in the heart; not onlyChrist revealed to us, but Christ revealed in us. All prudence andskill are from the Lord. Through the redemption of Christ's preciousblood, the riches of his grace abound in all wisdom and prudence. Manfound out many inventions for ruin; God found one for our recovery. Hehates pride and arrogance, evil ways and froward conversation; theserender men unwilling to hear his humbling, awakening, holyinstructions. True religion gives men the best counsel in all difficultcases, and helps to make their way plain. His wisdom makes all trulyhappy who receive it in the love of Christ Jesus. Seek him early, seekhim earnestly, seek him before any thing else. Christ never said, Seekin vain. Those who love Christ, are such as have seen his loveliness,and have had his love shed abroad in their hearts; therefore they arehappy. They shall be happy in this world, or in that which is beyondcompare better. Wealth gotten by vanity will soon be diminished, butthat which is well got, will wear well; and that which is well spentupon works of piety and charity, will be lasting. If they have notriches and honour in this world, they shall have that which isinfinitely better. They shall be happy in the grace of God. Christ, byhis Spirit, guides believers into all truth, and so leads them in theway of righteousness; and they walk after the Spirit. Also, they shallbe happy in the glory of God hereafter. In Wisdom's promises, believershave goods laid up, not for days and years, but for eternity; her fruittherefore is better than gold.
Pro 8:22-31	<br>The Son of God declares himself to have been engaged in the creation ofthe world. How able, how fit is the Son of God to be the Saviour of theworld, who was the Creator of it! The Son of God was ordained, beforethe world, to that great work. Does he delight in saving wretchedsinners, and shall not we delight in his salvation?
Pro 8:32-36	<br>Surely we should hearken to Christ's voice with the readiness ofchildren. Let us all be wise, and not refuse such mercy. Blessed arethose who hear the Saviour's voice, and wait on him with daily reading,meditation, and prayer. The children of the world find time for vainamusements, without neglecting what they deem the one thing needful.Does it not show contempt of Wisdom's instructions, when peopleprofessing godliness, seek excuses for neglecting the means of grace?Christ is Wisdom, and he is Life to all believers; nor can we obtainGod's favour, unless we find Christ, and are found in him. Those whooffend Christ deceive themselves; sin is a wrong to the soul. Sinnersdie because they will die, which justifies God when he judges.
Pro 9:1-12	<br>Christ has prepared ordinances to which his people are admitted, and bywhich nourishment is given here to those that believe in him, as wellas mansions in heaven hereafter. The ministers of the gospel go forthto invite the guests. The call is general, and shuts out none that donot shut out themselves. Our Saviour came, not to call the righteous,but sinners; not the wise in their own eyes, who say they see. We mustkeep from the company and foolish pleasures of the ungodly, or we nevercan enjoy the pleasures of a holy life. It is vain to seek the companyof wicked men in the hope of doing them good; we are far more likely tobe corrupted by them. It is not enough to forsake the foolish, we mustjoin those that walk in wisdom. There is no true wisdom but in the wayof religion, no true life but in the end of that way. Here is thehappiness of those that embrace it. A man cannot be profitable to God;it is for our own good. Observe the shame and ruin of those who slightit. God is not the Author of sin: and Satan can only tempt, he cannotforce. Thou shalt bear the loss of that which thou scornest: it willadd to thy condemnation.
Pro 9:13-18	<br>How diligent the tempter is, to seduce unwary souls into sin! Carnal,sensual pleasure, stupifies conscience, and puts out the sparks ofconviction. This tempter has no solid reason to offer; and where shegets dominion in a soul, all knowledge of holy things is lost andforgotten. She is very violent and pressing. We need to seek and prayfor true wisdom, for Satan has many ways to withdraw our souls fromChrist. Not only worldly lusts and abandoned seducers prove fatal tothe souls of men; but false teachers, with doctrines that flatter prideand give liberty to lusts, destroy thousands. They especially draw offsuch as have received only partial serious impressions. The depths ofSatan are depths of hell; and sin, without remorse, is ruin, ruinwithout remedy. Solomon shows the hook; those that believe him, willnot meddle with the bait. Behold the wretched, empty, unsatisfying,deceitful, and stolen pleasure sin proposes; and may our souls be sodesirous of the everlasting enjoyment of Christ, that on earth we maylive to him, daily, by faith, and ere long be with him in glory.
Pro 10:2,3	<br>Though the righteous may be poor, the Lord will not suffer him to wantwhat is needful for spiritual life.<br>Verse 4<br>Those who are fervent in spirit, serving the Lord, are likely to berich in faith, and rich in good works.<br>Verse 5<br>Here is just blame of those who trifle away opportunities, both forhere and for hereafter.<br>Verse 6<br>Abundance of blessings shall abide on good men; real blessings.<br>Verse 7<br>Both the just and the wicked must die; but between their souls there isa vast difference.<br>Verse 8<br>The wise in heart puts his knowledge in practice.<br>Verse 9<br>Dissemblers, after all their shuffling, will be exposed.<br>Verse 10<br>Trick and artifice will be no excuse for iniquity.<br>Verse 11<br>The good man's mouth is always open to teach, comfort, and correctothers.<br>Verse 12<br>Where there is hatred, every thing stirs up strife.

The wise gain this wisdom by reading, byhearing the word, by meditation, by prayer, by faith in Christ, who ismade of God unto us wisdom.<br>Verse 15<br>This refers to the common mistakes both of rich and poor, as to theiroutward condition. Rich people's wealth exposes them to many dangers;while a poor man may live comfortably, if he is content, keeps a goodconscience, and lives by faith.<br>Verse 16<br>Perhaps a righteous man has no more than what he works hard for, butthat labour tends to life.<br>Verse 17<br>The traveller that has missed his way, and cannot bear to be told ofit, and to be shown the right way, must err still.<br>Verse 18<br>He is especially a fool who thinks to hide anything from God; andmalice is no better.<br>Verse 19<br>Those that speak much, speak much amiss. He that checks himself is awise man, and therein consults his own peace.
Pro 10:20,21	<br>The tongue of the just is sincere, freed from the dross of guile andevil design. Pious discourse is spiritual food to the needy. Fools diefor want of a heart, so the word is; for want of thought.<br>Verse 22<br>That wealth which is truly desirable, has no vexation of spirit in theenjoyment; no grief for the loss; no guilt by the abuse of it. Whatcomes from the love of God, has the grace of God for its companion.<br>Verse 23<br>Only foolish and wicked men divert themselves with doing harm toothers, or tempting to sin.<br>Verse 24<br>The largest desire of eternal blessings the righteous can form, will begranted.<br>Verse 25<br>The course of prosperous sinners is like a whirlwind, which soon spendsitself, and is gone.<br>Verse 26<br>As vinegar sets the teeth on edge, and as the smoke causes the eyes tosmart, so the sluggard vexes his employer.
Pro 10:27,28	<br>What man is he that loves life? Let him fear God, and that will secureto him life enough in this world, and eternal life in the other.<br>Verse 29<br>The believer grows stronger in faith, and obeys with increased delight.<br>Verse 30<br>The wicked would be glad to have this earth their home for ever, but itcannot be so. They must die and leave all their idols behind.
Pro 10:31,32	<br>A good man discourses wisely for the benefit of others. But it is thesin, and will be the ruin of a wicked man, that he speaks what isdispleasing to God, and provoking to those he converses with. Therighteous is kept by the power of God; and nothing shall be able toseparate him from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus.
Pro 11:5,6	<br>The ways of wickedness are dangerous. And sin will be its ownpunishment.<br>Verse 7<br>When a godly man dies, all his fears vanish; but when a wicked mandies, his hopes vanish.<br>Verse 8<br>The righteous are often wonderfully kept from going into dangeroussituations, and the ungodly go in their stead.<br>Verse 9<br>Hypocrites delude men into error and sin by artful objections againstthe truths of God's word.

When those that takeroot in the world wither, those who are grafted into Christ shall befruitful.<br>Verse 29<br>He that brings trouble upon himself and his family, by carelessness, orby wickedness, shall be unable to keep and enjoy what he gets, as a manis unable to hold the wind, or to satisfy himself with it.<br>Verse 30<br>The righteous are as trees of life; and their influence upon earth,like the fruits of that tree, support and nourish the spiritual life inmany.<br>Verse 31<br>Even the righteous, when they offend on earth, shall meet with sharpcorrections; much more will the wicked meet the due reward of theirsins. Let us then seek those blessings which our Surety purchased byhis sufferings and death; let us seek to copy his example, and to keephis commandments.
Pro 14:26,27	<br>Those who fear the Lord so as to obey and serve him, have a strongground of confidence, and will be preserved.

Pro 15:8,9	<br>The wicked put other things in the stead of Christ's atonement, or inthe place of holy obedience.

He that understandsGod's word shall find good.<br>Verse 21<br>The man whose wisdom dwells in his heart, will be found more trulyprudent than many who possess shining talents.<br>Verse 22<br>As waters to a thirsty land, so is a wise man to his friends andneighbours.<br>Verse 23<br>The wise man's self-knowledge, always suggests something proper to bespoken to others.<br>Verse 24<br>The word of God cures the diseases that weaken our souls.<br>Verse 25<br>This is caution to all, to take heed of deceiving themselves as totheir souls.<br>Verse 26<br>We must labour for the meat which endureth to everlasting life, or wemust perish.
Pro 16:27,28	<br>Ungodly men bestow more pains to do mischief than would be needful todo good. The whisperer separates friends: what a hateful, but howcommon a character!
Pro 16:29,30	<br>Some do all the mischief they can by force and violence, and are blindto the result.<br>Verse 31<br>Old people especially should be found in the way of religion andgodliness.<br>Verse 32<br>To overcome our own passions, requires more steady management, thanobtaining victory over an enemy.<br>Verse 33<br>All the disposal of Providence concerning our affairs, we must lookupon to be the determining what we referred to God; and we must bereconciled to them accordingly. Blessed are those that give themselvesup to the will of God; for he knows what is good for them.
Pro 17:27,28	<br>A man may show himself to be a wise man, by the good temper of hismind, and by the good government of his tongue. He is careful when hedoes speak, to speak to the purpose. God knows his heart, and the follythat is bound there; therefore he cannot be deceived in his judgment asmen may be.
Pro 18:6,7	<br>What mischief bad men do to themselves by their ungoverned tongues!<br>Verse 8<br>How base are those that sow contention! and what fatal effects may beexpected from small beginnings of jealousy!<br>Verse 9<br>Omissions of duty, and in duty, are fatal to the soul, as well ascommissions of sin.
Pro 18:10,11	<br>The Divine power, made known in and through our Lord Jesus Christ,forms a strong tower for the believer, who relies on the Lord. Howdeceitful the defence of the rich man, who has his portion and treasurein this world! It is a strong city and a high wall only in his ownconceit; for it will fail when most in need. They will be exposed tothe just wrath of that Judge whom they despised as a Saviour.<br>Verse 12<br>After the heart has been lifted up with pride, a fall comes. But honourshall be the reward of humility.<br>Verse 13<br>Eagerness, with self-conceit, will expose to shame.<br>Verse 14<br>Firmness of mind supports under many pains and trials. But when theconscience is tortured with remorse, no human fortitude can bear themisery; what then will hell be?<br>Verse 15<br>We must get knowledge, not only into our heads, but into our hearts.<br>Verse 16<br>Blessed be the Lord, who makes us welcome to come to his throne,without money and without price. May his gifts make room for him in oursouls.<br>Verse 17<br>It is well to listen to our enemies, that we may form a better judgmentof ourselves.<br>Verse 18<br>It was customary sometimes to refer matters to God, by casting lots,with solemn prayer. The profaning the lot, by using it in matters ofdiversion, or coveting what belongs to others, forms an objection tothis now.<br>Verse 19<br>Great care must be taken to prevent quarrels among relations and thoseunder obligations to each other. Wisdom and grace make it easy toforgive; but corruption makes it difficult.<br>Verse 20<br>The belly is here put for the heart, as elsewhere; and what that isfilled with, our satisfaction will be accordingly, and our inwardpeace.<br>Verse 21<br>Many a one has caused his own death, or the death of others, by a falseor injurious tongue.<br>Verse 22<br>A good wife is a great blessing to a man, and it is a token of Divinefavour.<br>Verse 23<br>Poverty tells men they must not order or demand. And at the throne ofGod's grace we are all poor, and must use entreaties.<br>Verse 24<br>Christ Jesus never will forsake those who trust in and love him. May webe such friends to others, for our Master's sake. Having loved his own,which were in the world, he loved them unto the end; and we are hisfriends if we do whatever he commands us, Joh 15:14.
Pro 21:25,26	<br>Here is the misery of the slothful; their hands refuse to labour in anhonest calling, by which they might get an honest livelihood; yet theirhearts cease not to covet riches, pleasures, and honours, which cannotbe obtained without labour. But the righteous and industrious havetheir desires satisfied.<br>Verse 27<br>When holiness is pretended, but wickedness intended, that especially isan abomination.<br>Verse 28<br>The doom of a false witness is certain.<br>Verse 29<br>A wicked man bids defiance to the terrors of the law and the rebukes ofProvidence. But a good man asks, What does God require of me?
Pro 21:30,31	<br>Means are to be used, but, after all, our safety and salvation are onlyof the Lord. In our spiritual warfare we must arm ourselves with thewhole armour of God; but our strength must be in the Lord, and in thepower of his might.
Pro 22:17-21	<br>To these words, to this knowledge, the ear must be bowed down, and theheart applied by faith and love. To live a life of delight in God anddependence on him, is the foundation of all practical religion. The wayto know the certainty of the word of truth, is to make conscience ofour duty.
Pro 22:22,23	<br>He that robs and oppresses the poor, does so at his peril. And if menwill not appear for them, God will.
Pro 22:24,25	<br>Our corrupt hearts have so much tinder in them, that it is dangerous tohave to do with those that throw about the sparks of their passion.
Pro 22:26,27	<br>Every man ought to be just to himself, and his family; those are notso, who, by folly or other carelessness, waste what they have.<br>Verse 28<br>We are taught not to trespass on another man's right. And it is hard tofind a truly industrious man. Such a man will rise. Seest thou a mandiligent in the business of religion? He is likely to excel. Let usthen be diligent in God's work.
Pro 23:1-3	<br>God's restraints of the appetite only say, Do thyself no harm.
Pro 23:4,5	<br>Be not of those that will be rich. The things of this world are nothappiness and a portion for a soul; those that hold them ever so fast,cannot hold them always, cannot hold them long.
Pro 23:6-8	<br>Do not make thyself burdensome to any, especially those not sincere.When we are called by God to his feast, and to let our souls delightthemselves, Isa 25:6; 55:2, we may safely partake of the Bread of life.<br>Verse 9<br>It is our duty to take all fit occasions to speak of Divine things; butif what a wise man says will not be heard, let him hold his peace.
Pro 23:10,11	<br>The fatherless are taken under God's special protection. He is theirRedeemer, who will take their part; and he is mighty, almighty.
Pro 23:12-16	<br>Here is a parent instructing his child to give his mind to theScriptures. Here is a parent correcting his child: accompanied withprayer, and blessed of God, it may prove a means of preventing hisdestruction. Here is a parent encouraging his child, telling him whatwould be for his good. And what a comfort it would be, if herein heanswered his expectation!
Pro 23:17,18	<br>The believer's expectation shall not be disappointed; the end of histrials, and of the sinner's prosperity, is at hand.
Pro 23:19-28	<br>The gracious Saviour who purchased pardon and peace for his people,with all the affection of a tender parent, counsels us to hear and bewise, and is ready to guide our hearts in his way. Here we have anearnest call to young people, to attend to the advice of their godlyparents. If the heart be guided, the steps will be guided. Buy thetruth, and sell it not; be willing to part with any thing for it. Donot part with it for pleasures, honours, riches, or any thing in thisworld. The heart is what the great God requires. We must not think todivide the heart between God and the world; he will have all or none.Look to the rule of God's word, the conduct of his providence, and thegood examples of his people. Particular cautions are given against sinsmost destructive to wisdom and grace in the soul. It is really a shameto make a god of the belly. Drunkenness stupifies men, and then allgoes to ruin. Licentiousness takes away the heart that should be givento God. Take heed of any approaches toward this sin, it is very hard toretreat from it. It bewitches men to their ruin.
Pro 23:29-35	<br>Solomon warns against drunkenness. Those that would be kept from sin,must keep from all the beginnings of it, and fear coming within reachof its allurements. Foresee the punishment, what it will at last endin, if repentance prevent not. It makes men quarrel. Drunkards wilfullymake woe and sorrow for themselves. It makes men impure and insolent.The tongue grows unruly; the heart utters things contrary to reason,religion, and common civility. It stupifies and besots men. They are indanger of death, of damnation; as much exposed as if they slept uponthe top of a mast, yet feel secure. They fear no peril when the terrorsof the Lord are before them; they feel no pain when the judgments ofGod are actually upon them. So lost is a drunkard to virtue and honour,so wretchedly is his conscience seared, that he is not ashamed to say,I will seek it again. With good reason we were bid to stop before thebeginning. Who that has common sense would contract a habit, or sellhimself to a sin, which tends to such guilt and misery, and exposes aman every day to the danger of dying insensible, and awaking in hell?Wisdom seems in these chapters to take up the discourse as at thebeginning of the book. They must be considered as the words of Christto the sinner.
Pro 24:1,2	<br>Envy not sinners. And let not a desire ever come into thy mind, Oh thatI could shake off restraints!
Pro 24:3-6	<br>Piety and prudence in outward affairs, both go together to complete awise man. By knowledge the soul is filled with the graces and comfortsof the spirit, those precious and pleasant riches. The spirit isstrengthened for the spiritual work and the spiritual warfare, by truewisdom.
Pro 24:7-9	<br>A weak man thinks wisdom is too high for him, therefore he will take nopains for it. It is bad to do evil, but worse to devise it. Even thefirst risings of sin in the heart are sin, and must be repented of.Those that strive to make others hateful, make themselves so.<br>Verse 10<br>Under troubles we are apt to despair of relief. But be of good courage,and God shall strengthen thy heart.
Pro 24:11,12	<br>If a man know that his neighbour is in danger by any unjust proceeding,he is bound to do all in his power to deliver him. And what is it tosuffer immortal souls to perish, when our persuasions and example maybe the means of preventing it?
Pro 24:13,14	<br>We are quickened to the study of wisdom by considering both thepleasure and the profit of it. All men relish things that are sweet tothe palate; but many have no relish for the things that are sweet tothe purified soul, and that make us wise unto salvation.
Pro 24:15,16	<br>The sincere soul falls as a traveller may do, by stumbling at somestone in his path; but gets up, and goes on his way with more care andspeed. This is rather to be understood of falls into affliction, thanfalls into actual sin.
Pro 24:17,18	<br>The pleasure we are apt to take in the troubles of an enemy isforbidden.
Pro 24:19,20	<br>Envy not the wicked their prosperity; be sure there is no truehappiness in it.
Pro 24:21,22	<br>The godly in the land, will be quiet in the land. There may be cause tochange for the better, but have nothing to do with them that are givenchange.
Pro 24:23-26	<br>The wisdom God giveth, renders a man fit for his station. Every one whofinds the benefit of the right answer, will be attached to him thatgave it.<br>Verse 27<br>We must prefer necessaries before conveniences, and not go in debt.
Pro 24:28,29	<br>There are three defaults in a witness pointed out.
Pro 24:30-34	<br>See what a blessing the husbandman's calling is, and what a wildernessthis earth would be without it. See what great difference there is inthe management even of worldly affairs. Sloth and self-indulgence arethe bane of all good. When we see fields overgrown with thorns andthistles, and the fences broken down, we see an emblem of the far moredeplorable state of many souls. Every vile affection grows in men'shearts; yet they compose themselves to sleep. Let us show wisdom bydoubling our diligence in every good thing.
Pro 25:1-3	<br>God needs not search into any thing; nothing can be hid from him. Butit is the honour of rulers to search out matters, to bring to lighthidden works of darkness.
Pro 25:4,5	<br>For a prince to suppress vice, and reform his people, is the best wayto support his government.
Pro 25:6,7	<br>Religion teaches us humility and self-denial. He who has seen the gloryof the Lord in Christ Jesus, will feel his own unworthiness.
Pro 25:8-10	<br>To be hasty in beginning strife, will bring into difficulties. War mustat length end, and might better be prevented. It is so in privatequarrels; do all thou canst to settle the matter.
Pro 25:11,12	<br>A word of counsel, or reproof, rightly spoken, is especially beautiful,as fine fruit becomes still more beautiful in silver baskets.<br>Verse 13<br>See what ought to be the aim of him that is trusted with any business;to be faithful. A faithful minister, Christ's messenger, should be thusacceptable to us.<br>Verse 14<br>He who pretends to have received or given that which he never had, islike the morning cloud, that disappoints those who look for rain.<br>Verse 15<br>Be patient to bear a present hurt. Be mild to speak without passion;for persuasive language is the most effectual to prevail over thehardened mind.<br>Verse 16<br>God has given us leave to use grateful things, but we are cautionedagainst excess.<br>Verse 17<br>We cannot be upon good terms with our neighbours, without discretion aswell as sincerity. How much better a Friend is God than any otherfriend! The oftener we come to him, the more welcome.<br>Verse 18<br>A false testimony is dangerous in every thing.<br>Verse 19<br>Confidence in an unfaithful man is painful and vexatious; when we putany stress on him, he not only fails, but makes us feel for it.<br>Verse 20<br>We take a wrong course if we think to relieve those in sorrow byendeavouring to make them merry.
Pro 25:21,22	<br>The precept to love even our enemies is an Old Testament commandment.Our Saviour has shown his own great example in loving us when we wereenemies.<br>Verse 23<br>Slanders would not be so readily spoken, if they were not readilyheard. Sin, if it receives any check, becomes cowardly.<br>Verse 24<br>It is better to be alone, than to be joined to one who is a hinderanceto the comfort of life.<br>Verse 25<br>Heaven is a country afar off; how refreshing is good news from thence,in the everlasting gospel, which signifies glad tidings, and in thewitness of the Spirit with our spirits that we are God's children!<br>Verse 26<br>When the righteous are led into sin, it is as hurtful as if the publicfountains were poisoned.<br>Verse 27<br>We must be, through grace, dead to the pleasures of sense, and also tothe praises of men.<br>Verse 28<br>The man who has no command over his anger, is easily robbed of peace.Let us give up ourselves to the Lord, and pray him to put his Spiritwithin us, and cause us to walk in his statutes.
Pro 26:4,5	<br>We are to fit our remarks to the man, and address them to hisconscience, so as may best end the debate.
Pro 26:6-9	<br>Fools are not fit to be trusted, nor to have any honour. Wise sayings,as a foolish man delivers and applies them, lose their usefulness.<br>Verse 10<br>This verse may either declare how the Lord, the Creator of all men,will deal with sinners according to their guilt, or, how the powerfulamong men should disgrace and punish the wicked.<br>Verse 11<br>The dog is a loathsome emblem of those sinners who return to theirvices, 2Pe 2:22.<br>Verse 12<br>We see many a one who has some little sense, but is proud of it. Thisdescribes those who think their spiritual state to be good, when reallyit is very bad.<br>Verse 13<br>The slothful man hates every thing that requires care and labour. Butit is foolish to frighten ourselves from real duties by fancieddifficulties. This may be applied to a man slothful in the duties ofreligion.<br>Verse 14<br>Having seen the slothful man in fear of his work, here we find him inlove with his ease. Bodily ease is the sad occasion of many spiritualdiseases. He does not care to get forward with his business. Slothfulprofessors turn thus. The world and the flesh are hinges on which theyare hung; and though they move in a course of outward services, yetthey are not the nearer to heaven.<br>Verse 15<br>The sluggard is now out of his bed, but he might have lain there, forany thing he is likely to bring to pass in his work. It is common formen who will not do their duty, to pretend they cannot. Those that areslothful in religion, will not be at the pains to feed their souls withthe bread of life, nor to fetch in promised blessings by prayer.<br>Verse 16<br>He that takes pains in religion, knows he is working for a good Master,and that his labour shall not be in vain.<br>Verse 17<br>To make ourselves busy in other men's matters, is to thrust ourselvesinto temptation.
Pro 26:18,19	<br>He that sins in jest, must repent in earnest, or his sin will be hisruin.
Pro 26:20-22	<br>Contention heats the spirit, and puts families and societies into aflame. And that fire is commonly kindled and kept burning by whisperersand backbiters.<br>Verse 23<br>A wicked heart disguising itself, is like a potsherd covered with thedross of silver.
Pro 26:24-26	<br>Always distrust when a man speaks fair unless you know him well. Satan,in his temptations, speaks fair, as he did to Eve; but it is madness togive credit to him.<br>Verse 27<br>What pains men take to do mischief to others! but it is digging a pit,it is rolling a stone, hard work; and they prepare mischief tothemselves.<br>Verse 28<br>There are two sorts of lies equally detestable. A slandering lie, themischief of this every body sees. A flattering lie, which secretlyworks ruin. A wise man will be more afraid of a flatterer than of aslanderer.
Pro 27:3,4	<br>Those who have no command of their passions, sink under the load.
Pro 27:5,6	<br>Plain and faithful rebukes are better, not only than secret hatred, butthan love which compliments in sin, to the hurt of the soul.<br>Verse 7<br>The poor have a better relish of their enjoyments, and are often morethankful for them, than the rich. In like manner the proud andself-sufficient disdain the gospel; but those who hunger and thirstafter righteousness, find comfort from the meanest book or sermon thattestifies of Christ Jesus.<br>Verse 8<br>Every man has his proper place in society, where he may be safe andcomfortable.
Pro 27:9,10	<br>Depend not for relief upon a kinsman, merely for kindred's sake; applyto those who are at hand, and will help in need. But there is a Friendthat sticketh closer than a brother, and let us place entire confidencein him.<br>Verse 11<br>An affectionate parent urges his son to prudent conduct that shouldgladden his heart. The good conduct of Christians is the best answer toall who find fault with the gospel.<br>Verse 12<br>Where there is temptation, if we thrust ourselves into it, there willbe sin, and punishment will follow.<br>Verse 13<br>An honest man may be made a beggar, but he is not honest that makeshimself one.<br>Verse 14<br>It is folly to be fond of being praised; it is a temptation to pride.
Pro 27:15,16	<br>The contentions of a neighbour may be like a sharp shower, troublesomefor a time; the contentions of a wife are like constant rain.<br>Verse 17<br>We are cautioned to take heed whom we converse with. And directed tohave in view, in conversation, to make one another wiser and better.<br>Verse 18<br>Though a calling be laborious and despised, yet those who keep to it,will find there is something to be got by it. God is a Master who hasengaged to honour those who serve him faithfully.<br>Verse 19<br>One corrupt heart is like another; so are sanctified hearts: the formerbear the same image of the earthly, the latter the same image of theheavenly. Let us carefully watch our own hearts, comparing them withthe word of God.<br>Verse 20<br>Two things are here said to be never satisfied, death and sin. Theappetites of the carnal mind for profit or pleasure are always desiringmore. Those whose eyes are ever toward the Lord, are satisfied in him,and shall for ever be so.<br>Verse 21<br>Silver and gold are tried by putting them into the furnace andfining-pot; so is a man tried by praising him.<br>Verse 22<br>Some are so bad, that even severe methods do not answer the end; whatremains but that they should be rejected? The new-creating power ofGod's grace alone is able to make a change.
Pro 27:23-27	<br>We ought to have some business to do in this world, and not to live inidleness, and not to meddle with what we do not understand. We must bediligent and take pains. Let us do what we can, still the world cannotbe secured to us, therefore we must choose a more lasting portion; butby the blessing of God upon our honest labours, we may expect to enjoyas much of earthly blessings as is good for us.
Pro 30:1-6	<br>Agur speaks of himself as wanting a righteousness, and having done veryfoolishly. And it becomes us all to have low thoughts of ourselves. Hespeaks of himself as wanting revelation to guide him in the ways oftruth and wisdom. The more enlightened people are, the more they lamenttheir ignorance; the more they pray for clearer, still clearerdiscoveries of God, and his rich grace in Christ Jesus. In 
Pro 30:4),there is a prophetic notice of Him who came down from heaven to be ourInstructor and Saviour, and then ascended into heaven to be ourAdvocate. The Messiah is here spoken of as a Person distinct from theFather, but his name as yet secret. The great Redeemer, in the gloriesof his providence and grace, cannot be found out to perfection. Had itnot been for Christ, the foundations of the earth had sunk under theload of the curse upon the ground, for man's sin. Who, and what is themighty One that doeth all this? There is not the least ground tosuspect anything wanting in the word of God; adding to his words opensthe way to errors and corruptions.	
Pro 30:7-9	<br>Agur wisely prayed for a middle state, that he might be kept at adistance from temptations; he asked daily bread suited to his station,his family, and his real good. There is a remarkable similarity betweenthis prayer and several clauses of the Lord's prayer. If we are removedfrom vanity and lies; if we are interested in the pardoning love ofChrist, and have him for our portion; if we walk with God, then weshall have all we can ask or think, as to spiritual things. When weconsider how those who have abundance are prone to abuse the gift, andwhat it is to suffer want, Agur's prayer will ever be found a wise one,though seldom offered. Food convenient; what is so for one, may not beso for another; but we may be sure that our heavenly Father will supplyall our need, and not suffer us to want anything good for us; and whyshould we wish for more?<br>Verse 10<br>Slander not a servant to his master, accuse him not in small matters,to make mischief.
Pro 30:11-14	<br>In every age there are monsters of ingratitude who ill-treat theirparents. Many persuade themselves they are holy persons, whose heartsare full of sin, and who practise secret wickedness. There are otherswhose lofty pride is manifest. There have also been cruel monsters inevery age.
Pro 30:15-17	<br>Cruelty and covetousness are two daughters of the horseleech, thatstill cry, "Give, give," and they are continually uneasy to themselves.Four things never are satisfied, to which these devourers are compared.Those are never rich that are always coveting. And many who have cometo a bad end, have owned that their wicked courses began by despisingtheir parents' authority.
Pro 30:18-20	<br>Four things cannot be fully known. The kingdom of nature is full ofmarvels. The fourth is a mystery of iniquity; the cursed arts by whicha vile seducer gains the affections of a female; and the arts which avile woman uses to conceal her wickedness.
Pro 30:21-23	<br>Four sorts of persons are very troublesome. Men of low origin and basespirit, who, getting authority, become tyrants. Foolish and violent menindulging in excesses. A woman of a contentious spirit and vicioushabits. A servant who has obtained undue influence. Let those whomProvidence has advanced from low beginnings, carefully watch againstthat sin which most easily besets them.
Pro 30:24-28	<br>Four things that are little, are yet to be admired. There are those whoare poor in the world, and of small account, yet wise for their soulsand another world.
Pro 30:29-33	<br>We may learn from animals to go well; also to keep our temper under allprovocations. We must keep the evil thought in our minds from breakingout into evil speeches. We must not stir up the passions of others. Letnothing be said or done with violence, but every thing with softnessand calmness. Alas, how often have we done foolishly in rising upagainst the Lord our King! Let us humble ourselves before him. Andhaving found peace with Him, let us follow peace with all men.
Pro 31:1-9	<br>When children are under the mother's eye, she has an opportunity offashioning their minds aright. Those who are grown up, should oftencall to mind the good teaching they received when children. The manyawful instances of promising characters who have been ruined by vilewomen, and love of wine, should warn every one to avoid these evils.Wine is to be used for want or medicine. Every creature of God is good,and wine, though abused, has its use. By the same rule, due praise andconsolation should be used as cordials to the dejected and tempted, notadministered to the confident and self-sufficient. All in authorityshould be more carefully temperate even than other men; and should beprotectors of those who are unable or afraid to plead their own cause.Our blessed Lord did not decline the bitterest dregs of the cup ofsorrow put into his hands; but he puts the cup of consolation into thehands of his people, and causes those to rejoice who are in the deepestdistress.
Pro 31:10-31	<br>This is the description of a virtuous woman of those days, but thegeneral outlines equally suit every age and nation. She is very carefulto recommend herself to her husband's esteem and affection, to know hismind, and is willing that he rule over her. 1. She can be trusted, andhe will leave such a wife to manage for him. He is happy in her. Andshe makes it her constant business to do him good. 2. She is one thattakes pains in her duties, and takes pleasure in them. She is carefulto fill up time, that none be lost. She rises early. She appliesherself to the business proper for her, to women's business. She doeswhat she does, with all her power, and trifles not. 3. She makes whatshe does turn to good account by prudent management. Many undothemselves by buying, without considering whether they can afford it.She provides well for her house. She lays up for hereafter. 4. Shelooks well to the ways of her household, that she may oblige all to dotheir duty to God and one another, as well as to her. 5. She is intentupon giving as upon getting, and does it freely and cheerfully. 6. Sheis discreet and obliging; every word she says, shows she governsherself by the rules of wisdom. She not only takes prudent measuresherself, but gives prudent advice to others. The law of love andkindness is written in the heart, and shows itself in the tongue. Herheart is full of another world, even when her hands are most busy aboutthis world. 7. Above all, she fears the Lord. Beauty recommends none toGod, nor is it any proof of wisdom and goodness, but it has deceivedmany a man who made his choice of a wife by it. But the fear of Godreigning in the heart, is the beauty of the soul; it lasts for ever. 8.She has firmness to bear up under crosses and disappointments. Sheshall reflect with comfort when she comes to be old, that she was notidle or useless when young. She shall rejoice in a world to come. Sheis a great blessing to her relations. If the fruit be good, the treemust have our good word. But she leaves it to her own works to praiseher. Every one ought to desire this honour that cometh from God; andaccording to this standard we all ought to regulate our judgments. Thisdescription let all women daily study, who desire to be truly belovedand respected, useful and honourable. This passage is to be applied toindividuals, but may it not also be applied to the church of God, whichis described as a virtuous spouse? God by his grace has formed fromamong sinful men a church of true believers, to possess all theexcellences here described.
Amo 2:1-8	<br>The evil passions of the heart break out in various forms; but the Lordlooks to our motives, as well as our conduct. Those that deal cruelly,shall be cruelly dealt with. Other nations were reckoned with forinjuries done to men; Judah is reckoned with for dishonour done to God.Judah despised the law of the Lord; and he justly gave them up tostrong delusion; nor was it any excuse for their sin, that they werethe lies, the idols, after which their fathers walked. The worstabominations and most grievous oppressions have been committed by someof the professed worshippers of the Lord. Such conduct leads many tounbelief and vile idolatry.
Amo 2:9-16	<br>We need often to be reminded of the mercies we have received; which addmuch to the evil of the sins we have committed. They had helps fortheir souls, which taught them how to make good use of their earthlyenjoyments, and were therefore more valuable. Faithful ministers aregreat blessings to any people; but it is God that raises them up to beso. Sinners' own consciences will witness that he has not been wantingto them in the means of grace. They did what they could to leadbelievers aside. Satan and his agents are busy to corrupt the minds ofyoung people who look heavenward; they overcome many by drawing them tothe love of mirth and pleasure, and into drinking company. Multitudesof young men who bade fair as professors of religion, have erredthrough strong drink, and have been undone for ever. The Lord complainsof sin, especially the sins of his professing people, as a burden tohim. And though his long-suffering be tired, his power is not, and sothe sinner will find to his cost. When men reject God's word, addingobstinacy to sin, and this becomes the general character of a people,they will be given up to misery, notwithstanding all their boastedpower and resources. May we then humble ourselves before the Lord, forall our ingratitude and unfaithfulness.
Amo 3:1-8	<br>The distinguishing favours of God to us, if they do not restrain fromsin, shall not exempt from punishment. They could not expect communionwith God, unless they first sought peace with him. Where there is notfriendship, there can be no fellowship. God and man cannot walktogether, except they are agreed. Unless we seek his glory, we cannotwalk with him. Let us not presume on outward privileges, withoutspecial, sanctifying grace. The threatenings of the word and providenceof God against the sin of man are certain, and certainly show that thejudgments of God are at hand. Nor will God remove the affliction he hassent, till it has done its work. The evil of sin is from ourselves, itis our own doing; but the evil of trouble is from God, and is hisdoing, whoever are the instruments. This should engage us patiently tobear public troubles, and to study to answer God's meaning in them. Thewhole of the passage shows that natural evil, or troubles, and notmoral evil, or sin, is here meant. The warning given to a carelessworld will increase its condemnation another day. Oh the amazingstupidity of an unbelieving world, that will not be wrought upon by theterrors of the Lord, and that despise his mercies!
Amo 3:9-15	<br>That power which is an instrument of unrighteousness, will justly bebrought down and broken. What is got and kept wrongfully, will not bekept long. Some are at ease, but there will come a day of visitation,and in that day, all they are proud of, and put confidence in, shallfail them. God will inquire into the sins of which they have beenguilty in their houses, the robbery they have stored up, and the luxuryin which they lived. The pomp and pleasantness of men's houses, do notfortify against God's judgments, but make sufferings the more grievousand vexatious. Yet a remnant, according to the election of grace, willbe secured by our great and good Shepherd, as from the jaws ofdestruction, in the worst times.
Amo 4:1-5	<br>What is got by extortion is commonly used to provide for the flesh, andto fulfil the lusts thereof. What is got by oppression cannot beenjoyed with satisfaction. How miserable are those whose confidence inunscriptural observances only prove that they believe a lie! Let us seeto it that our faith, hope, and worship, are warranted by the Divineword.
Amo 4:6-13	<br>See the folly of carnal hearts; they wander from one creature toanother, seeking for something to satisfy, and labour for that whichsatisfies not; yet, after all, they will not incline their ear to Himin whom they might find all they can want. Preaching the gospel is asrain, and every thing withers where this rain is wanting. It were wellif people were as wise for their souls as they are for their bodies;and, when they have not this rain near, would go and seek it where itis to be had. As the Israelites persisted in rebellion and idolatry,the Lord was coming against them as an adversary. Ere long, we mustmeet our God in judgment; but we shall not be able to stand before him,if he tries us according to our doings. If we would prepare to meet ourGod with comfort, at the awful period of his coming, we must now meethim in Christ Jesus, the eternal Son of the Father, who came to savelost sinners. We must seek him while he is to be found.
Amo 5:1-6	<br>The convincing, awakening word must be heard and heeded, as well aswords of comfort and peace; for whether we hear or forbear, the word ofGod shall take effect. The Lord still proclaims mercy to men, but theyoften expect deliverance from such self-invented forms as make theircondemnation sure. While they refuse to come to Christ and to seekmercy in and by him, that they may live, the fire of Divine wrathbreaks forth upon them. Men may make an idol of the world, but willfind it cannot protect.
Amo 5:7-17	<br>The same almighty power can, for repenting sinners, easily turnaffliction and sorrow into prosperity and joy, and as easily turn theprosperity of daring sinners into utter darkness. Evil times will notbear plain dealing; that is, evil men will not. And these men were evilmen indeed, when wise and good men thought it in vain even to speak tothem. Those who will seek and love that which is good, may help to savethe land from ruin. It behoves us to plead God's spiritual promises, tobeseech him to create in us a clean heart, and to renew a right spiritwithin us. The Lord is ever ready to be gracious to the souls that seekhim; and then piety and every duty will be attended to. But as forsinful Israel, God's judgments had often passed by them, now they shallpass through them.
Amo 5:18-27	<br>Woe unto those that desire the day of the Lord's judgments, that wishfor times of war and confusion; as some who long for changes, hoping torise upon the ruins of their country! but this should be so great adesolation, that nobody could gain by it. The day of the Lord will be adark, dismal, gloomy day to all impenitent sinners. When God makes aday dark, all the world cannot make it light. Those who are notreformed by the judgments of God, will be pursued by them; if theyescape one, another stands ready to seize them. A pretence of piety isdouble iniquity, and so it will be found. The people of Israel copiedthe crimes of their forefathers. The law of worshipping the Lord ourGod, is, Him only we must serve. Professors thrive so little, becausethey have little or no communion with God in their duties. They wereled captive by Satan into idolatry, therefore God caused them to gointo captivity among idolaters.
Amo 6:1-7	<br>Those are looked upon as doing well for themselves, who do well fortheir bodies; but we are here told what their ease is, and what theirwoe is. Here is a description of the pride, security, and sensuality,for which God would reckon. Careless sinners are every where in danger;but those at ease in Zion, who are stupid, vainly confident, andabusing their privileges, are in the greatest danger. Yet many fancythemselves the people of God, who are living in sin, and in conformityto the world. But the examples of others' ruin forbid us to be secure.Those who are set upon their pleasures are commonly careless of thetroubles of others, but this is great offence to God. Those who placedtheir happiness in the pleasures of sense, and set their hearts uponthem, shall be deprived of those pleasures. Those who try to put theevil day far from them, find it nearest to them.
Amo 6:8-14	<br>How dreadful, how miserable, is the case of those whose eternal ruinthe Lord himself has sworn; for he can execute his purpose, and nonecan alter it! Those hearts are wretchedly hardened that will not bebrought to mention God's name, and to worship him, when the hand of Godis gone out against them, when sickness and death are in theirfamilies. Those that will not be tilled as fields, shall be abandonedas rocks. When our services of God are soured with sin, his providenceswill justly be made bitter to us. Men should take warning not to hardentheir hearts, for those who walk in pride, God will destroy.
Amo 7:1-9	<br>God bears long, but he will not bear always with a provoking people.The remembrance of the mercies we formerly received, like the produceof the earth of the former growth, should make us submissive to thewill of God, when we meet with disappointments in the latter growth.The Lord has many ways of humbling a sinful nation. Whatever trouble weare under, we should be most earnest with God for the forgiveness ofsin. Sin will soon make a great people small. What will become ofIsrael, if the hand that should raise him be stretched out against him?See the power of prayer. See what a blessing praying people are to aland. See how ready, how swift God is to show mercy; how he waits to begracious. Israel was a wall, a strong wall, which God himself reared asa defence to his sanctuary. The Lord now seems to stand upon this wall.He measures it; it appears to be a bowing, bulging wall. Thus God wouldbring the people of Israel to the trial, would discover theirwickedness; and the time will come, when those who have been sparedoften, shall be spared no longer. But the Lord still calls Israel hispeople. The repeated prayer and success of the prophet should lead usto seek the Saviour.
Amo 7:10-17	<br>It is no new thing for the accusers of the brethren, to misrepresentthem as enemies to the king and kingdom, as traitors to their prince,and troublers of the land, when they are the best friends to both.Those who make gain their godliness, and are governed by the hopes ofwealth and preferment, are ready to think these the most powerfulmotives with others also. But those who have a warrant from God, likeAmos, ought not to fear the face of man. If God, that sent him, had notstrengthened him, he could not thus have set his face as a flint. TheLord often chooses the weak and foolish things of the world to confoundthe wise and mighty. But no fervent prayers, or self-denying labours,can bring proud sinners to bear faithful reproofs and warnings. And allwho oppose or despise the Divine word, must expect fatal effects totheir souls, unless they repent.
Amo 8:1-3	<br>Amos saw a basket of summer fruit gathered, and ready to be eaten;which signified, that the people were ripe for destruction, that theyear of God's patience was drawing towards a conclusion. Such summerfruits will not keep till winter, but must be used at once. Yet thesejudgments shall not draw from them any acknowledgement, either of God'srighteousness or their own unrighteousness. Sinners put off repentancefrom day to day, because they think the Lord thus delays his judgments.
Amo 8:4-10	<br>The rich and powerful of the land were the most guilty of oppression,as well as the foremost in idolatry. They were weary of the restraintsof the sabbaths and the new moons, and wished them over, because nocommon work might be done therein. This is the character of many whoare called Christians. The sabbath day and sabbath work are a burden tocarnal hearts. It will either be profaned or be accounted a dull day.But can we spend our time better than in communion with God? Whenemployed in religious services, they were thinking of marketings. Theywere weary of holy duties, because their worldly business stood stillthe while. Those are strangers to God, and enemies to themselves, wholove market days better than sabbath days, who would rather be sellingcorn than worshipping God. They have no regard to man: those who havelost the savour of piety, will not long keep the sense of commonhonesty. They cheat those they deal with. They take advantage of theirneighbour's ignorance or necessity, in a traffic which nearly concernsthe labouring poor. Could we witness the fraud and covetousness, which,in such numerous forms, render trading an abomination to the Lord, weshould not wonder to see many dealers backward in the service of God.But he who thus despises the poor, reproaches his Maker; as it regardsHim, rich and poor meet together. Riches that are got by the ruin ofthe poor, will bring ruin on those that get them. God will remembertheir sin against them. This speaks the case of such unjust, unmercifulmen, to be miserable indeed, miserable for ever. There shall be terrorand desolation every where. It shall come upon them when they littlethink of it. Thus uncertain are all our creature-comforts andenjoyments, even life itself; in the midst of life we are in death.What will be the wailing in the bitter day which follows sinful andsensual pleasures!
Amo 8:11-14	<br>Here was a token of God's highest displeasure. At any time, and most ina time of trouble, a famine of the word of God is the heaviestjudgment. To many this is no affliction, yet some will feel it verymuch, and will travel far to hear a good sermon; they feel the loss ofthe mercies others foolishly sin away. But when God visits abacksliding church, their own plans and endeavours to find out a way ofsalvation, will stand them in no stead. And the most amiable andzealous would perish, for want of the water of life, which Christ onlycan bestow. Let us value our advantages, seek to profit by them, andfear sinning them away.
Amo 9:1-10	<br>The prophet, in vision, saw the Lord standing upon the idolatrous altarat Bethel. Wherever sinners flee from God's justice, it will overtakethem. Those whom God brings to heaven by his grace, shall never be castdown; but those who seek to climb thither by vain confidence inthemselves, will be cast down and filled with shame. That which makesescape impossible and ruin sure, is, that God will set his eyes uponthem for evil, not for good. Wretched must those be on whom the Lordlooks for evil, and not for good. The Lord would scatter the Jews, andvisit them with calamities, as the corn is shaken in a sieve; but hewould save some from among them. The astonishing preservation of theJews as a distinct people, seems here foretold. If professors makethemselves like the world, God will level them with the world. Thesinners who thus flatter themselves, shall find that their professionwill not protect them.
Amo 9:11-15	<br>Christ died to gather together the children of God that were scatteredabroad, here said to be those who were called by his name. The Lordsaith this, who doeth this, who can do it, who has determined to do it,the power of whose grace is engaged for doing it. Verses #(13-15) mayrefer to the early times of Christianity, but will receive a moreglorious fulfilment in the events which all the prophets more or lessforetold, and may be understood of the happy state when the fulnessboth of the Jews and the Gentiles come into the church. Let us continueearnest in prayer for the fulfilment of these prophecies, in the peace,purity, and the beauty of the church. God marvellously preserves hiselect amidst the most fearful confusions and miseries. When all seemsdesperate, he wonderfully revives his church, and blesses her with allspiritual blessings in Christ Jesus. And great shall be the glory ofthat period, in which not one good thing promised shall remainunfulfilled.
Oba 1:1-16	<br>This prophecy is against Edom. Its destruction seems to have beentypical, as their father Esau's rejection; and to refer to thedestruction of the enemies of the gospel church. See the prediction ofthe success of that war; Edom shall be spoiled, and brought down. Allthe enemies of God's church shall be disappointed in the things theystay themselves on. God can easily lay those low who magnify and exaltthemselves; and will do it. Carnal security ripens men for ruin, andmakes the ruin worse when it comes. Treasures on earth cannot be sosafely laid up but that thieves may break through and steal; it istherefore our wisdom to lay up for ourselves treasures in heaven. Thosethat make flesh their trust, arm it against themselves. The God of ourcovenant will never deceive us: but if we trust men with whom we joinourselves, it may prove to us a wound and dishonour. God will justlydeny those understanding to keep out of danger, who will not use theirunderstandings to keep out of sin. All violence, all unrighteousness,is sin; but it makes the violence far worse, if it be done against anyof God's people. Their barbarous conduct towards Judah and Jerusalem,is charged upon them. In reflecting on ourselves, it is good toconsider what we should have done; to compare our practice with theScripture rule. Sin, thus looked upon in the glass of the commandment,will appear exceedingly sinful. Those have a great deal to answer for,who are idle spectators of the troubles of their neighbours, when ableto be active helpers. Those make themselves poor, who think to makethemselves rich by the ruin of the people of God; and those deceivethemselves, who call all that their own on which they can lay theirhands in a day of calamity. Though judgment begins at the house of God,it shall not end there. Let sorrowful believers and insolent oppressorsknow, that the troubles of the righteous will soon end, but those ofthe wicked will be eternal.
Oba 1:17-21	<br>There should be deliverance and holiness at Jerusalem, and the house ofJacob would again occupy their possessions. Much of this prophecy wasfulfilled when the Jews returned to their own land. But the salvationand holiness of the gospel, its spread, and the conversion of theGentiles, seem also to be intended, especially the restoration ofIsrael, the destruction of antichrist, and the prosperous state of thechurch, to which all the prophets bear witness. When Christ is come,and not till then, shall the kingdom be the Lord's in the full sense ofthe term. As none that exalt themselves against the Lord shall prosper,and all shall be brought down; so none that wait upon the Lord, and puttheir trust in him, shall ever be dismayed. Blessed be the DivineSaviour and Judge on Mount Zion! His word shall be a savour of lifeunto life unto numbers, while it judges and condemns obstinateunbelievers.
Jon 1:1-3	<br>It is sad to think how much sin is committed in great cities. Theirwickedness, as that of Nineveh, is a bold and open affront to God.Jonah must go at once to Nineveh, and there, on the spot, cry againstthe wickedness of it. Jonah would not go. Probably there are few amongus who would not have tried to decline such a mission. Providenceseemed to give him an opportunity to escape; we may be out of the wayof duty, and yet may meet with a favourable gale. The ready way is notalways the right way. See what the best of men are, when God leavesthem to themselves; and what need we have, when the word of the Lordcomes to us, to have the Spirit of the Lord to bring every thoughtwithin us into obedience.
Jon 1:4-7	<br>God sent a pursuer after Jonah, even a mighty tempest. Sin bringsstorms and tempests into the soul, into the family, into churches andnations; it is a disquieting, disturbing thing. Having called upontheir gods for help, the sailors did what they could to helpthemselves. Oh that men would be thus wise for their souls, and wouldbe willing to part with that wealth, pleasure, and honour, which theycannot keep without making shipwreck of faith and a good conscience,and ruining their souls for ever! Jonah was fast asleep. Sin isstupifying, and we are to take heed lest at any time our hearts arehardened by the deceitfulness of it. What do men mean by sleeping on insin, when the word of God and the convictions of their own consciences,warn them to arise and call on the Lord, if they would escapeeverlasting misery? Should not we warn each other to awake, to arise,to call upon our God, if so be he will deliver us? The sailorsconcluded the storm was a messenger of Divine justice sent to some onein that ship. Whatever evil is upon us at any time, there is a causefor it; and each must pray, Lord, show me wherefore thou contendestwith me. The lot fell upon Jonah. God has many ways of bringing tolight hidden sins and sinners, and making manifest that folly which wasthought to be hid from the eyes of all living.
Jon 1:8-12	<br>Jonah gave an account of his religion, for that was his business. Wemay hope that he told with sorrow and shame, justifying God, condemninghimself, and explaining to the mariners what a great God Jehovah is.They said to him, Why hast thou done this? If thou fearest the God thatmade the sea and the dry land, why wast thou such a fool as to thinkthou couldst flee from his presence? If the professors of religion dowrong, they will hear it from those who make no such profession. Whensin has raised a storm, and laid us under the tokens of God'sdispleasure, we must consider what is to be done to the sin that raisedthe storm. Jonah uses the language of true penitents, who desire thatnone but themselves may fare the worse for their sins and follies.Jonah sees this to be the punishment of his iniquity, he accepts it,and justifies God in it. When conscience is awakened, and a stormraised, nothing will turn it into a calm but parting with the sin thatcaused the disturbance. Parting with our money will not pacify theconscience, the Jonah must be thrown overboard.
Jon 1:13-17	<br>The mariners rowed against wind and tide, the wind of God'sdispleasure, the tide of his counsel; but it is in vain to think ofsaving ourselves any other way than by destroying our sins. Evennatural conscience cannot but dread blood-guiltiness. And when we areled by Providence God does what he pleases, and we ought to besatisfied, though it may not please us. Throwing Jonah into the sea putan end to the storm. God will not afflict for ever, He will onlycontend till we submit and turn from our sins. Surely these heathenmariners will rise up in judgment against many called Christians, whoneither offer prayers when in distress, nor thanksgiving for signaldeliverances. The Lord commands all creatures, and can make any of themserve his designs of mercy to his people. Let us see this salvation ofthe Lord, and admire his power, that he could thus save a drowning man,and his pity, that he would thus save one who was running from him, andhad offended him. It was of the Lord's mercies that Jonah was notconsumed. Jonah was alive in the fish three days and nights: to naturethis was impossible, but to the God of nature all things are possible.Jonah, by this miraculous preservation, was made a type of Christ; asour blessed Lord himself declared, Mt 12:40.
Jon 2:1-9	<br>Observe when Jonah prayed. When he was in trouble, under the tokens ofGod's displeasure against him for sin: when we are in affliction wemust pray. Being kept alive by miracle, he prayed. A sense of God'sgood-will to us, notwithstanding our offences, opens the lips inprayer, which were closed with the dread of wrath. Also, where heprayed; in the belly of the fish. No place is amiss for prayer. Men mayshut us from communion with one another, but not from communion withGod. To whom he prayed; to the Lord his God. This encourages evenbacksliders to return. What his prayer was. This seems to relate hisexperience and reflections, then and afterwards, rather than to be theform or substance of his prayer. Jonah reflects on the earnestness ofhis prayer, and God's readiness to hear and answer. If we would getgood by our troubles, we must notice the hand of God in them. He hadwickedly fled from the presence of the Lord, who might justly take hisHoly Spirit from him, never to visit him more. Those only aremiserable, whom God will no longer own and favour. But though he wasperplexed, yet not in despair. Jonah reflects on the favour of God tohim, when he sought to God, and trusted in him in his distress. Hewarns others, and tells them to keep close to God. Those who forsaketheir own duty, forsake their own mercy; those who run away from thework of their place and day, run away from the comfort of it. As far asa believer copies those who observe lying vanities, he forsakes his ownmercy, and lives below his privileges. But Jonah's experienceencourages others, in all ages, to trust in God, as the God ofsalvation.<br>Verse 10<br>Jonah's deliverance may be considered as an instance of God's powerover all the creatures. As an instance of God's mercy to a poorpenitent, who in distress prays to him: and as a type and figure ofChrist's resurrection. Amidst all our varying experiences, and thechanging scenes of life; we should look by faith, fixedly, upon ouronce suffering and dying, but now risen and ascended Redeemer. Let usconfess our sins, consider Christ's resurrection as an earnest of ourown, and thankfully receive every temporal and spiritual deliverance,as the pledge of our eternal redemption.
Jon 3:1-4	<br>God employs Jonah again in his service. His making use of us is anevidence of his being at peace with us. Jonah was not disobedient, ashe had been. He neither endeavoured to avoid hearing the command, nordeclined to obey it. See here the nature of repentance; it is thechange of our mind and way, and a return to our work and duty. Also,the benefit of affliction; it brings those back to their place who haddeserted it. See the power of Divine grace, for affliction of itselfwould rather drive men from God, than draw them to him. God's servantsmust go where he sends them, come when he calls them, and do what hebids them; we must do whatever the word of the Lord commands. Jonahfaithfully and boldly delivered his errand. Whether Jonah said more, toshow the anger of God against them, or whether he only repeated thesewords again and again, is not certain, but this was the purport of hismessage. Forty days is a long time for a righteous God to delayjudgments, yet it is but a little time for an unrighteous people torepent and reform in. And should it not awaken us to get ready fordeath, to consider that we cannot be so sure that we shall live fortydays, as Nineveh then was that it should stand forty days? We should bealarmed if we were sure not to live a month, yet we are careless thoughwe are not sure to live a day.
Jon 3:5-10	<br>There was a wonder of Divine grace in the repentance and reformation ofNineveh. It condemns the men of the gospel generation, Mt 12:41. A verysmall degree of light may convince men that humbling themselves beforeGod, confessing their sins with prayer, and turning from sin, are meansof escaping wrath and obtaining mercy. The people followed the exampleof the king. It became a national act, and it was necessary it shouldbe so, when it was to prevent a national ruin. Let even the brutecreatures' cries and moans for want of food remind their owners to cryto God. In prayer we must cry mightily, with fixedness of thought,firmness of faith, and devout affections. It concerns us in prayer tostir up all that is within us. It is not enough to fast for sin, but wemust fast from sin; and, in order to the success of our prayers, wemust no more regard iniquity in our hearts, Ps 66:18. The work of afast-day is not done with the day. The Ninevites hoped that God wouldturn from his fierce anger; and that thus their ruin would beprevented. They could not be so confident of finding mercy upon theirrepentance, as we may be, who have the death and merits of Christ, towhich we may trust for pardon upon repentance. They dared not presume,but they did not despair. Hope of mercy is the great encouragement torepentance and reformation. Let us boldly cast ourselves down at thefootstool of free grace, and God will look upon us with compassion. Godsees who turn from their evil ways, and who do not. Thus he sparedNineveh. We read of no sacrifices offered to God to make atonement forsin; but a broken and a contrite heart, such as the Ninevites then had,he will not despise.
Jon 4:1-4	<br>What all the saints make matter of joy and praise, Jonah makes thesubject of reflection upon God; as if showing mercy were animperfection of the Divine nature, which is the greatest glory of it.It is to his sparing, pardoning mercy, we all owe it that we are out ofhell. He wishes for death: this was the language of folly, passion, andstrong corruption. There appeared in Jonah remains of a proud,uncharitable spirit; and that he neither expected nor desired thewelfare of the Ninevites, but had only come to declare and witnesstheir destruction. He was not duly humbled for his own sins, and wasnot willing to trust the Lord with his credit and safety. In this frameof mind, he overlooked the good of which he had been an instrument, andthe glory of the Divine mercy. We should often ask ourselves, Is itwell to say thus, to do thus? Can I justify it? Do I well to be so soonangry, so often angry, so long angry, and to give others ill languagein my anger? Do I well to be angry at the mercy of God to repentingsinners? That was Jonah's crime. Do we do well to be angry at thatwhich is for the glory of God, and the advancement of his kingdom? Letthe conversion of sinners, which is the joy of heaven, be our joy, andnever our grief.
Jon 4:5-11	<br>Jonah went out of the city, yet remained near at hand, as if heexpected and desired its overthrow. Those who have fretful, uneasyspirits, often make troubles for themselves, that they may still havesomething to complain of. See how tender God is of his people in theirafflictions, even though they are foolish and froward. A thing small initself, yet coming seasonably, may be a valuable blessing. A gourd inthe right place may do us more service than a cedar. The leastcreatures may be great plagues, or great comforts, as God is pleased tomake them. Persons of strong passions are apt to be cast down with anytrifle that crosses them, or to be lifted up with a trifle that pleasesthem. See what our creature-comforts are, and what we may expect themto be; they are withering things. A small worm at the root destroys alarge gourd: our gourds wither, and we know not what is the cause.Perhaps creature-comforts are continued to us, but are made bitter; thecreature is continued, but the comfort is gone. God prepared a wind tomake Jonah feel the want of the gourd. It is just that those who loveto complain, should never be left without something to complain of.When afflicting providences take away relations, possessions, andenjoyments, we must not be angry at God. What should especially silencediscontent, is, that when our gourd is gone, our God is not gone. Sinand death are very dreadful, yet Jonah, in his heat, makes light ofboth. One soul is of more value than the whole world; surely then onesoul is of more value than many gourds: we should have more concern forour own and others' precious souls, than for the riches and enjoymentsof this world. It is a great encouragement to hope we shall find mercywith the Lord, that he is ready to show mercy. And murmurers shall bemade to understand, that how willing soever they are to keep the Divinegrace to themselves and those of their own way, there is one Lord overall, who is rich in mercy to all that call upon him. Do we wonder atthe forbearance of God towards his perverse servant? Let us study ourown hearts and ways; let us not forget our own ingratitude andobstinacy; and let us be astonished at God's patience towards us.
Mic 1:1-7	<br>The earth is called upon, with all that are therein, to hear theprophet. God's holy temple will not protect false professors. Neithermen of high degree, as the mountains, nor men of low degree, as thevalleys, can secure themselves or the land from the judgments of God.If sin be found in God's people he will not spare them; and their sinsare most provoking to him, for they are most reproaching. When we feelthe smart of sin, it behoves us to seek what is the sin we smart for.Persons and places most exalted, are most exposed to spiritualdiseases. The vices of leaders and rulers shall be surely and sorelypunished. The punishment answers the sin. What they gave to idols,never shall prosper, nor do them any good. What is got by one lust, iswasted on another.
Mic 1:8-16	<br>The prophet laments that Israel's case is desperate; but declare it notin Gath. Gratify not those that make merry with the sins or with thesorrows of God's Israel. Roll thyself in the dust, as mourners used todo; let every house in Jerusalem become a house of Aphrah, "a house ofdust." When God makes the house dust it becomes us to humble ourselvesto the dust under his mighty hand. Many places should share thismourning. The names have meanings which pointed out the miseries comingupon them; thereby to awaken the people to a holy fear of Divine wrath.All refuges but Christ, must be refuges of lies to those who trust inthem; other heirs will succeed to every inheritance but that of heaven;and all glory will be turned into shame, except that honour whichcometh from God only. Sinners may now disregard their neighbours'sufferings, yet their turn to be punished will some come.
Mic 2:1-5	<br>Woe to the people that devise evil during the night, and rise early tocarry it into execution! It is bad to do mischief on a sudden thought,much worse to do it with design and forethought. It is of great momentto improve and employ hours of retirement and solitude in a propermanner. If covetousness reigns in the heart, compassion is banished;and when the heart is thus engaged, violence and fraud commonly occupythe hands. The most haughty and secure in prosperity, are commonly mostready to despair in adversity. Woe to those from whom God turns away!Those are the sorest calamities which cut us off from the congregationof the Lord, or cut us short in the enjoyment of its privileges.
Mic 2:6-11	<br>Since they say, "Prophesy not," God will take them at their word, andtheir sin shall be their punishment. Let the physician no longer attendthe patient that will not be healed. Those are enemies, not only toGod, but to their country, who silence good ministers, and stop themeans of grace. What bonds will hold those who have no reverence forGod's word? Sinners cannot expect to rest in a land they have polluted.You shall not only be obliged to depart out of this land, but it shalldestroy you. Apply this to our state in this present world. There iscorruption in the world through lust, and we should keep at a distancefrom it. It is not our rest: it was designed for our passage, but notfor our portion; our inn, but not our home; here we have no continuingcity; let us therefore arise and depart, let us seek a continuing cityabove. Since they will be deceived, let them be deceived. Teachers whorecommend self-indulgence by their doctrine and example, best suit suchsinners.
Mic 2:12,13	<br>These verses may refer to the captivity of Israel and Judah. But thepassage is also a prophecy of the conversion of the Jews to Christ. TheLord would not only bring them from captivity, and multiply them, butthe Lord Jesus would open their way to God, by taking upon him thenature of man, and by the work of his Spirit in their hearts, breakingthe fetters of Satan. Thus he has gone before, and the people follow,breaking, in his strength, through the enemies that would stop theirway to heaven.
Mic 3:1-8	<br>Men cannot expect to do ill, and fare well; but to find that done tothem which they did to others. How seldom do wholesome truths reach theears of those in high stations or in authority! Those who deceiveothers are preparing confusion for their own faces. The prophet hadardent love to God and to the souls of men; deep concern for his gloryand their salvation, and zeal against sin. The difficulties he met withdid not drive him from his work. He had this strength; not from and ofhimself, but he was full of power by the Spirit of the Lord. Those whoact honestly, may act boldly. And those who come to hear the word ofGod, must be willing to be told of their faults, must take it kindly,and be thankful.
Mic 3:9-12	<br>Zion's walls owe no thanks to those that build them up with blood andiniquity. The sin of man works not the righteousness of God. Even whenmen do that which in itself is good, but do it for filthy lucre, itbecomes abomination both to God and man. Faith rests in the Lord as thesoul's foundation: presumption only leans upon the Lord as a prop, andwould use him to serve a turn. If men's having the Lord among them willnot keep them from doing evil, it never can secure them from sufferingevil for so doing. See the doom of wicked Jacob; Therefore shall Zionfor your sake be ploughed as a field. This was exactly fulfilled at thedestruction of Jerusalem by the Romans, and is so at this day. Ifsacred places are polluted by sin, they will be wasted and ruined bythe judgments of God.
Mic 4:1-8	<br>The nations have not yet so submitted to the Prince of Peace, as tobeat their swords into ploughshares, nor has war ceased. But veryprecious promises these are, relating to the gospel church, which willbe more and more fulfilled, for He is faithful that has promised. Thereshall be a glorious church for God set up in the world, in the lastdays, in the days of the Messiah. Christ himself will build it upon arock. The Gentiles worshipped their idol gods; but in the period spokenof, the people will cleave to the Lord with full purpose of heart, anddelight in doing his will. The word "halteth," describes those who walknot according to the Divine word. The collecting the captives fromBabylon was an earnest of healing, purifying, and prospering thechurch; and the reign of Christ shall continue till succeeded by theeverlasting kingdom of heaven. Let us stir up each other to attend theordinances of God, that we may learn his holy ways, and walk in them,receiving the law from his hands, which, being written in our hearts byhis Spirit, may show our interest in the Redeemer's righteousness.
Mic 4:9-13	<br>Many nations would assemble against Zion to rejoice in her calamities.They would not understand that the Lord had collected them as sheavesare gathered to be threshed; and that Zion would be strengthened tobeat them to pieces. Nothing has yet taken place in the history of theJewish church agreeing with this prediction. When God has conqueringwork for his people to do, he will furnish them with strength andability for it. Believers should cry aloud under distresses, with theprayer of faith, not with despondency.
Mic 5:1-6	<br>Having showed how low the house of David would be brought, a predictionof the Messiah and his kingdom is added to encourage the faith of God'speople. His existence from eternity as God, and his office as Mediator,are noticed. Here is foretold that Bethlehem should be his birthplace.Hence it was universally known among the Jews, Mt 2:5. Christ'sgovernment shall be very happy for his subjects; they shall be safe andeasy. Under the shadow of protection from the Assyrians, is a promiseof protection to the gospel church and all believers, from the designsand attempts of the powers of darkness. Christ is our Peace as aPriest, making atonement for sin, and reconciling us to God; and he isour Peace as a King, conquering our enemies: hence our souls may dwellat ease in him. Christ will find instruments to protect and deliver.Those that threaten ruin to the church of God, soon bring ruin onthemselves. This may include the past powerful effects of the preachedgospel, its future spread, and the ruin of all antichristian powers.This is, perhaps, the most important single prophecy in the OldTestament: it respects the personal character of the Messiah, and thediscoveries of himself to the world. It distinguishes his human birthfrom his existing from eternity; it foretells the rejection of theIsraelites and Jews for a season, their final restoration, and theuniversal peace to prevail through the whole earth in the latter days.In the mean time let us trust our Shepherd's care and power. If hepermits the assault of our enemies, he will supply helpers andassistance for us.
Mic 5:7-15	<br>The remnant of Israel, converted to Christ in the primitive times, wereamong many nations as the drops of dew, and were made instruments incalling a large increase of spiritual worshippers. But to those whoneglected or opposed this salvation, they would, as lions, causeterror, their doctrine condemning them. The Lord also declares that hewould cause not only the reformation of the Jews, but the purificationof the Christian church. In like manner shall we be assured of victoryin our personal conflicts, as we simply depend upon the Lord oursalvation, worship him, and serve him with diligence.
Mic 6:1-5	<br>The people are called upon to declare why they were weary of God'sworship, and prone to idolatry. Sin causes the controversy between Godand man. God reasons with us, to teach us to reason with ourselves. Letthem remember God's many favours to them and their fathers, and comparewith them their unworthy, ungrateful conduct toward him.
Mic 6:6-8	<br>These verses seem to contain the substance of Balak's consultation withBalaam how to obtain the favour of Israel's God. Deep conviction ofguilt and wrath will put men upon careful inquiries after peace andpardon, and then there begins to be some ground for hope of them. Inorder to God's being pleased with us, our care must be for an interestin the atonement of Christ, and that the sin by which we displease himmay be taken away. What will be a satisfaction to God's justice? Inwhose name must we come, as we have nothing to plead as our own? Inwhat righteousness shall we appear before him? The proposals betrayignorance, though they show zeal. They offer that which is very richand costly. Those who are fully convinced of sin, and of their miseryand danger by reason of it, would give all the world, if they had it,for peace and pardon. Yet they do not offer aright. The sacrifices hadvalue from their reference to Christ; it was impossible that the bloodof bulls and goats should take away sin. And all proposals of peace,except those according to the gospel, are absurd. They could not answerthe demands of Divine justice, nor satisfy the wrong done to the honourof God by sin, nor would they serve at all in place of holiness of theheart and reformation of the life. Men will part with any thing ratherthan their sins; but they part with nothing so as to be accepted ofGod, unless they do part with their sins. Moral duties are commandedbecause they are good for man. In keeping God's commandments there is agreat reward, as well as after keeping them. God has not only made itknown, but made it plain. The good which God requires of us is, not thepaying a price for the pardon of sin and acceptance with God, but loveto himself; and what is there unreasonable, or hard, in this? Everythought within us must be brought down, to be brought into obedience toGod, if we would walk comfortably with him. We must do this as penitentsinners, in dependence on the Redeemer and his atonement. Blessed bethe Lord that he is ever ready to give his grace to the humble, waitingpenitent.
Mic 6:9-16	<br>God, having showed how necessary it was that they should do justly,here shows how plain it was that they had done unjustly. This voice ofthe Lord says to all, Hear the rod when it is coming, before you seeit, and feel it. Hear the rod when it is come, and you are sensible ofthe smart; hear what counsels, what cautions it speaks. The voice ofGod is to be heard in the rod of God. Those who are dishonest in theirdealings shall never be reckoned pure, whatever shows of devotion theymay make. What is got by fraud and oppression, cannot be kept orenjoyed with satisfaction. What we hold closest we commonly losesoonest. Sin is a root of bitterness, soon planted, but not soonplucked up again. Their being the people of God in name and profession,while they kept themselves in his love, was an honour to them; but now,being backsliders, their having been once the people of God turns totheir reproach.
Mic 7:1-7	<br>The prophet bemoans himself that he lived among a people ripening apacefor ruin, in which many good persons would suffer. Men had no comfort,no satisfaction in their own families or in their nearest relations.Contempt and violation of domestic duties are a sad symptom ofuniversal corruption. Those are never likely to come to good who areundutiful to their parents. The prophet saw no safety or comfort but inlooking to the Lord, and waiting on God his salvation. When undertrials, we should look continually to our Divine Redeemer, that we mayhave strength and grace to trust in him, and to be examples to thosearound us.
Mic 7:8-13	<br>Those truly penitent for sin, will see great reason to be patient underaffliction. When we complain to the Lord of the badness of the times,we ought to complain against ourselves for the badness of our hearts.We must depend upon God to work deliverance for us in due time. We mustnot only look to him, but look for him. In our greatest distresses, weshall see no reason to despair of salvation, if by faith we look to theLord as the God of our salvation. Though enemies triumph and insult,they shall be silenced and put to shame. Though Zion's walls may longbe in ruins, there will come a day when they shall be repaired. Israelshall come from all the remote parts, not turning back fordiscouragements. Though our enemies may seem to prevail against us, andto rejoice over us, we should not despond. Though cast down, we are notdestroyed; we may join hope in God's mercy, with submission to hiscorrection. No hinderances can prevent the favours the Lord intends forhis church.
Mic 7:14-20	<br>When God is about to deliver his people, he stirs up their friends topray for them. Apply spiritually the prophet's prayer to Christ, totake care of his church, as the great Shepherd of the sheep, and to gobefore them, while they are here in this world as in a wood, in thisworld but not of it. God promises in answer to this prayer, he will dothat for them which shall be repeating the miracles of former ages. Astheir sin brought them into bondage, so God's pardoning their sinbrought them out. All who find pardoning mercy, cannot but wonder atthat mercy; we have reason to stand amazed, if we know what it is. Whenthe Lord takes away the guilt of sin, that it may not condemn us, hewill break the power of sin, that it may not have dominion over us. Ifleft to ourselves, our sins will be too hard for us; but God's graceshall be sufficient to subdue them, so that they shall not rule us, andthen they shall not ruin us. When God forgives sin, he takes care thatit never shall be remembered any more against the sinner. He caststheir sins into the sea; not near the shore-side, where they may appearagain, but into the depth of the sea, never to rise again. All theirsins shall be cast there, for when God forgives sin, he forgives all.He will perfect that which concerns us, and with this good work will doall for us which our case requires, and which he has promised. Theseengagements relate to Christ, and the success of the gospel to the endof time, the future restoration of Israel, and the final prevailing oftrue religion in all lands. The Lord will perform his truth and mercy,not one jot or tittle of it shall fall to the ground: faithful is Hethat has promised, who also will do it. Let us remember that the Lordhas given the security of his covenant, for strong consolation to allwho flee for refuge to lay hold on the hope set before them in ChristJesus.
Nah 1:1-8	<br>About a hundred years before, at Jonah's preaching, the Ninevitesrepented, and were spared, yet, soon after, they became worse thanever. Nineveh knows not that God who contends with her, but is toldwhat a God he is. It is good for all to mix faith with what is heresaid concerning Him, which speaks great terror to the wicked, andcomfort to believers. Let each take his portion from it: let sinnersread it and tremble; and let saints read it and triumph. The anger ofthe Lord is contrasted with his goodness to his people. Perhaps theyare obscure and little regarded in the world, but the Lord knows them.The Scripture character of Jehovah agrees not with the views of proudreasoners. The God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ is slow to wrathand ready to forgive, but he will by no means acquit the wicked; andthere is tribulation and anguish for every soul that doeth evil: butwho duly regards the power of his wrath?
Nah 1:9-15	<br>There is a great deal plotted against the Lord by the gates of hell,and against his kingdom in the world; but it will prove in vain. Withsome sinners God makes quick despatch; and one way or other, he willmake an utter end of all his enemies. Though they are quiet, and manyvery secure, and not in fear, they shall be cut down as grass and corn,when the destroying angel passes through. God would hereby work greatdeliverance for his own people. But those who make themselves vile byscandalous sins, God will make vile by shameful punishments. Thetidings of this great deliverance shall be welcomed with abundant joy.These words are applied to the great redemption wrought out by our LordJesus and the everlasting gospel, Ro 10:15. Christ's ministers aremessengers of good tidings, that preach peace by Jesus Christ. Howwelcome to those who see their misery and danger by sin! And thepromise they made in the day of trouble must be made good. Let us bethankful for God's ordinances, and gladly attend them. Let us lookforward with cheerful hope to a world where the wicked never can enter,and sin and temptation will no more be known.
Nah 2:1-10	<br>Nineveh shall not put aside this judgment; there is no counsel orstrength against the Lord. God looks upon proud cities, and brings themdown. Particular account is given of the terrors wherein the invadingenemy shall appear against Nineveh. The empire of Assyria isrepresented as a queen, about to be led captive to Babylon. Guilt inthe conscience fills men with terror in an evil day; and what willtreasures or glory do for us in times of distress, or in the day ofwrath? Yet for such things how many lose their souls!
Nah 2:11-13	<br>The kings of Assyria had long been terrible and cruel to theirneighbours, but the Lord would destroy their power. Many plead as anexcuse for rapine and fraud, that they have families to provide for;but what is thus obtained will never do them any good. Those that fearthe Lord, and get honestly what they have, shall not want forthemselves and theirs. It is just with God to deprive those ofchildren, or of comfort in them, who take sinful courses to enrichthem. Those are not worthy to be heard again, that have spokenreproachfully of God. Let us then come to God upon his mercy-seat, thathaving peace with him through our Lord Jesus Christ, we may know thathe is for us, and that all things shall work together for oureverlasting good.
Nah 3:1-7	<br>When proud sinners are brought down, others should learn not to liftthemselves up. The fall of this great city should be a lesson toprivate persons, who increase wealth by fraud and oppression. They arepreparing enemies for themselves; and if the Lord sees good to punishthem in this world, they will have none to pity them. Every man whoseeks his own prosperity, safety, and peace, should not only act in anupright, honourable manner, but with kindness to all.
Nah 3:8-19	<br>Strong-holds, even the strongest, are no defence against the judgmentsof God. They shall be unable to do any thing for themselves. TheChaldeans and Medes would devour the land like canker-worms. TheAssyrians also would be eaten up by their own numerous hired troops,which seem to be meant by the word rendered "merchants." Those thathave done evil to their neighbours, will find it come home to them.Nineveh, and many other cities, states, and empires, have been ruined,and should be a warning to us. Are we better, except as there are sometrue Christians amongst us, who are a greater security, and a strongerdefence, than all the advantages of situation or strength? When theLord shows himself against a people, every thing they trust in mustfail, or prove a disadvantage; but he continues good to Israel. He is astrong-hold for every believer in time of trouble, that cannot bestormed or taken; and he knoweth those that trust in Him.
Hab 1:1-11	<br>The servants of the Lord are deeply afflicted by seeing ungodliness andviolence prevail; especially among those who profess the truth. No manscrupled doing wrong to his neighbour. We should long to remove to theworld where holiness and love reign for ever, and no violence shall bebefore us. God has good reasons for his long-suffering towards bad men,and the rebukes of good men. The day will come when the cry of sin willbe heard against those that do wrong, and the cry of prayer for thosethat suffer wrong. They were to notice what was going forward among theheathen by the Chaldeans, and to consider themselves a nation to bescourged by them. But most men presume on continued prosperity, or thatcalamities will not come in their days. They are a bitter and hastynation, fierce, cruel, and bearing down all before them. They shallovercome all that oppose them. But it is a great offence, and thecommon offence of proud people, to take glory to themselves. Theclosing words give a glimpse of comfort.
Hab 1:12-17	<br>However matters may be, yet God is the Lord our God, our Holy One. Weare an offending people, he is an offended God, yet we will notentertain hard thoughts of him, or of his service. It is great comfortthat, whatever mischief men design, the Lord designs good, and we aresure that his counsel shall stand. Though wickedness may prosper awhile, yet God is holy, and does not approve the wickedness. As hecannot do iniquity himself, so he is of purer eyes than to behold itwith any approval. By this principle we must abide, though thedispensations of his providence may for a time, in some cases, seem tous not to agree with it. The prophet complains that God's patience wasabused; and because sentence against these evil works and workers wasnot executed speedily, their hearts were the more fully set in them todo evil. Some they take up as with the angle, one by one; others theycatch in shoals, as in their net, and gather them in their drag, theirenclosing net. They admire their own cleverness and contrivance: thereis great proneness in us to take the glory of outward prosperity toourselves. This is idolizing ourselves, sacrificing to the drag-netbecause it is our own. God will soon end successful and splendidrobberies. Death and judgment shall make men cease to prey on others,and they shall be preyed on themselves. Let us remember, whateveradvantages we possess, we must give all the glory to God.
Hab 2:1-4	<br>When tossed and perplexed with doubts about the methods of Providence,we must watch against temptations to be impatient. When we have pouredout complaints and requests before God, we must observe the answers Godgives by his word, his Spirit, and providences; what the Lord will sayto our case. God will not disappoint the believing expectations ofthose who wait to hear what he will say unto them. All are concerned inthe truths of God's word. Though the promised favour be deferred long,it will come at last, and abundantly recompense us for waiting. Thehumble, broken-hearted, repenting sinner, alone seeks to obtain aninterest in this salvation. He will rest his soul on the promise, andon Christ, in and through whom it is given. Thus he walks and works, aswell as lives by faith, perseveres to the end, and is exalted to glory;while those who distrust or despise God's all-sufficiency will not walkuprightly with him. The just shall live by faith in these preciouspromises, while the performance of them is deferred. Only those madejust by faith, shall live, shall be happy here and for ever.
Hab 2:5-14	<br>The prophet reads the doom of all proud and oppressive powers that bearhard upon God's people. The lusts of the flesh, the lust of the eye,and the pride of life, are the entangling snares of men; and we findhim that led Israel captive, himself led captive by each of these. Nomore of what we have is to be reckoned ours, than what we come honestlyby. Riches are but clay, thick clay; what are gold and silver but whiteand yellow earth? Those who travel through thick clay, are hindered anddirtied in their journey; so are those who go through the world in themidst of abundance of wealth. And what fools are those that burdenthemselves with continual care about it; with a great deal of guilt ingetting, saving, and spending it, and with a heavy account which theymust give another day! They overload themselves with this thick clay,and so sink themselves down into destruction and perdition. See whatwill be the end hereof; what is gotten by violence from others, othersshall take away by violence. Covetousness brings disquiet anduneasiness into a family; he that is greedy of gain troubles his ownhouse; what is worse, it brings the curse of God upon all the affairsof it. There is a lawful gain, which, by the blessing of God, may be acomfort to a house; but what is got by fraud and injustice, will bringpoverty and ruin upon a family. Yet that is not the worst; Thou hastsinned against thine own soul, hast endangered it. Those who wrongtheir neighbours, do much greater wrong to their own souls. If thesinner thinks he has managed his frauds and violence with art andcontrivance, the riches and possessions he heaped together will witnessagainst him. There are not greater drudges in the world than those whoare slaves to mere wordly pursuits. And what comes of it? They findthemselves disappointed of it, and disappointed in it; they will own itis worse than vanity, it is vexation of spirit. By staining and sinkingearthly glory, God manifests and magnifies his own glory, and fills theearth with the knowledge of it, as plentifully as waters cover the sea,which are deep, and spread far and wide.
Hab 2:15-20	<br>A severe woe is pronounced against drunkenness; it is very fearfulagainst all who are guilty of drunkenness at any time, and in anyplace, from the stately palace to the paltry ale-house. To give onedrink who is in want, who is thirsty and poor, or a weary traveller, orready to perish, is charity; but to give a neighbour drink, that he mayexpose himself, may disclose secret concerns, or be drawn into a badbargain, or for any such purpose, this is wickedness. To be guilty ofthis sin, to take pleasure in it, is to do what we can towards themurder both of soul and body. There is woe to him, and punishmentanswering to the sin. The folly of worshipping idols is exposed. TheLord is in his holy temple in heaven, where we have access to him inthe way he has appointed. May we welcome his salvation, and worship himin his earthly temples, through Christ Jesus, and by the influence ofthe Holy Spirit.
Hab 3:1,2	<br>The word prayer seems used here for an act of devotion. The Lord wouldrevive his work among the people in the midst of the years ofadversity. This may be applied to every season when the church, orbelievers, suffer under afflictions and trials. Mercy is what we mustflee to for refuge, and rely upon as our only plea. We must not say,Remember our merit, but, Lord, remember thy own mercy.
Hab 3:3-15	<br>God's people, when in distress, and ready to despair, seek help byconsidering the days of old, and the years of ancient times, and bypleading them with God in prayer. The resemblance between theBabylonish and Egyptian captivities, naturally presents itself to themind, as well as the possibility of a like deliverance through thepower of Jehovah. God appeared in his glory. All the powers of natureare shaken, and the course of nature changed, but all is for thesalvation of God's own people. Even what seems least likely, shall bemade to work for their salvation. Hereby is given a type and figure ofthe redemption of the world by Jesus Christ. It is for salvation withthine anointed. Joshua who led the armies of Israel, was a figure ofHim whose name he bare, even Jesus, our Joshua. In all the salvationswrought for them, God looked upon Christ the Anointed, and broughtdeliverances to pass by him. All the wonders done for Israel of old,were nothing to that which was done when the Son of God suffered on thecross for the sins of his people. How glorious his resurrection andascension! And how much more glorious will be his second coming, to putan end to all that opposes him, and all that causes suffering to hispeople!
Hab 3:16-19	<br>When we see a day of trouble approach, it concerns us to prepare. Agood hope through grace is founded in holy fear. The prophet lookedback upon the experiences of the church in former ages, and observedwhat great things God had done for them, and so was not only recovered,but filled with holy joy. He resolved to delight and triumph in theLord; for when all is gone, his God is not gone. Destroy the vines andthe fig-trees, and you make all the mirth of a carnal heart to cease.But those who, when full, enjoyed God in all, when emptied and poor,can enjoy all in God. They can sit down upon the heap of the ruins oftheir creature-comforts, and even then praise the Lord, as the God oftheir salvation, the salvation of the soul, and rejoice in him as such,in their greatest distresses. Joy in the Lord is especially seasonablewhen we meet with losses and crosses in the world. Even when provisionsare cut off, to make it appear that man lives not by bread alone, wemay be supplied by the graces and comforts of God's Spirit. Then weshall be strong for spiritual warfare and work, and with enlargement ofheart may run the way of his commandments, and outrun our troubles. Andwe shall be successful in spiritual undertakings. Thus the prophet, whobegan his prayer with fear and trembling, ends it with joy and triumph.And thus faith in Christ prepares for every event. The name of Jesus,when we can speak of Him as ours, is balm for every wound, a cordialfor every care. It is as ointment poured forth, shedding fragrancethrough the whole soul. In the hope of a heavenly crown, let us sitloose to earthly possessions and comforts, and cheerfully bear up undercrosses. Yet a little while, and He that shall come will come, and willnot tarry; and where he is, we shall be also.
Zep 1:1-6	<br>Ruin is coming, utter ruin; destruction from the Almighty. The servantsof God all proclaim, There is no peace for the wicked. The expressionsare figurative, speaking every where desolation; the land shall be leftwithout inhabitants. The sinners to be consumed are, the professedidolaters, and those that worship Jehovah and idols, or swear to theLord, and to Malcham. Those that think to divide their affections andworship between God and idols, will come short of acceptance with God;for what communion can there be between light and darkness? If Satanhave half, he will have all; if the Lord have but half, he will havenone. Neglect of God shows impiety and contempt. May none of us beamong those who draw back unto perdition, but of those who believe tothe saving of the soul.
Zep 1:7-13	<br>God's day is at hand; the punishment of presumptuous sinners is asacrifice to the justice of God. The Jewish royal family shall bereckoned with for their pride and vanity; and those that leap on thethreshold, invading their neighbours' rights, and seizing theirpossessions. The trading people and the rich merchants are called toaccount. Secure and careless people are reckoned with. They are secureand easy; they say in their heart, the Lord will not do good, neitherwill he do evil; that is, they deny his dispensing rewards andpunishments. But in the day of the Lord's judgment, it will clearlyappear that those who perish, fall a sacrifice to Divine justice forbreaking God's law, and because they have no interest by faith in theRedeemer's atoning sacrifice.
Zep 1:14-18	<br>This warning of approaching destruction, is enough to make the sinnersin Zion tremble; it refers to the great day of the Lord, the day inwhich he will show himself by taking vengeance on them. This day of theLord is very near; it is a day of God's wrath, wrath to the utmost. Itwill be a day of trouble and distress to sinners. Let them not be laidasleep by the patience of God. What is a man profited if he gain thewhole world, and lose his own soul? And what shall a man give inexchange for his soul? Let us flee from the wrath to come, and choosethe good part that shall never be taken from us; then we shall beprepared for every event; nothing shall separate us from the love ofGod in Christ Jesus our Lord.
Zep 2:1-3	<br>The prophet calls to national repentance, as the only way to preventnational ruin. A nation not desiring, that has not desires toward God,is not desirous of his favour and grace, has no mind to repent andreform. Or, not desirable, not having any thing to recommend them toGod; to whom God might justly say, Depart from me; but he says, Gathertogether to me that you may seek my face. We know what God's decreewill bring against impenitent sinners, therefore it highly concerns allto repent in the accepted time. How careful should we all be to seekpeace with God, before the Holy Spirit withdraws from us, or ceases tostrive with us; before the day of grace is over, or the day of life;before our everlasting state is determined! Let the poor, despised, andafflicted, seek the Lord, and seek to understand and keep hiscommandments better, that they may be more humbled for their sins. Thechief hope of deliverance from national judgments rests upon prayer.
Zep 2:4-15	<br>Those are really in a woful condition who have the word of the Lordagainst them, for no word of his shall fall to the ground. God willrestore his people to their rights, though long kept from them. It hasbeen the common lot of God's people, in all ages, to be reproached andreviled. God shall be worshipped, not only by all Israel, and thestrangers who join them, but by the heathen. Remote nations must bereckoned with for the wrongs done to God's people. The sufferings ofthe insolent and haughty in prosperity, are unpitied and unlamented.But all the desolations of flourishing nations will make way for theoverturning Satan's kingdom. Let us improve our advantages, and expectthe performance of every promise, praying that our Father's name may behallowed every where, over all the earth.
Zep 3:1-7	<br>The holy God hates sin most in those nearest to him. A sinful state is,and will be, a woful state. Yet they had the tokens of God's presence,and all the advantages of knowing his will, with the strongest reasonsto do it; still they persisted in disobedience. Alas, that men oftenare more active in doing wickedness than believers are in doing good.
Zep 3:8-13	<br>The preaching of the gospel is predicted, when vengeance would beexecuted on the Jewish nation. The purifying doctrines of the gospel,or the pure language of the grace of the Lord, would teach men to usethe language of humility, repentance, and faith. Purity and piety incommon conversation is good. The pure and happy state of the church inthe latter days seems intended. The Lord will shut out boasting, andleave men nothing to glory in, save the Lord Jesus, as made of God tothem wisdom, righteousness, sanctification, and redemption. Humiliationfor sin, and obligations to the Redeemer, will make true believersupright and sincere, whatever may be the case among mere professors.
Zep 3:14-20	<br>After the promises of taking away sin, follow promises of taking awaytrouble. When the cause is removed, the effect will cease. What makes apeople holy, will make them happy. The precious promises made to thepurified people, were to have full accomplishment in the gospel. Theseverses appear chiefly to relate to the future conversion andrestoration of Israel, and the glorious times which are to follow. Theyshow the abundant peace, comfort, and prosperity of the church, in thehappy times yet to come. He will save; he will be Jesus; he will answerthe name, for he will save his people from their sins. Before theglorious times foretold, believers would be sorrowful, and objects ofreproach. But the Lord will save the weakest believer, and cause trueChristians to be greatly honoured where they had been treated withcontempt. One act of mercy and grace shall serve, both to gather Israelout of their dispersions and to lead them to their own land. Then willGod's Israel be made a name and a praise to eternity. The events alonecan fully answer the language of this prophecy. Many are the troublesof the righteous, but they may rejoice in God's love. Surely our heartsshould honour the Lord, and rejoice in him, when we hear such words ofcondescension and grace. If now kept from his ordinances, it is ourtrial and grief; but in due time we shall be gathered into his templeabove. The glory and happiness of the believer will be perfect,unchangeable, and eternal, when he is freed from earthly sorrows, andbrought to heavenly bliss.
Hag 1:1-11	<br>Observe the sin of the Jews, after their return from captivity inBabylon. Those employed for God may be driven from their work by astorm, yet they must go back to it. They did not say that they wouldnot build a temple, but, Not yet. Thus men do not say they will neverrepent and reform, and be religious, but, Not yet. And so the greatbusiness we were sent into the world to do, is not done. There is aproneness in us to think wrongly of discouragements in our duty, as ifthey were a discharge from our duty, when they are only for the trialof our courage and faith. They neglected the building of God's house,that they might have more time and money for worldly affairs. That thepunishment might answer to the sin, the poverty they thought to preventby not building the temple, God brought upon them for not building it.Many good works have been intended, but not done, because men supposedthe proper time was not come. Thus believers let slip opportunities ofusefulness, and sinners delay the concerns of their souls, till toolate. If we labour only for the meat that perishes, as the Jews here,we are in danger of losing our labour; but we are sure it shall not bein vain in the Lord, if we labour for the meat which lasts to eternallife. If we would have the comfort and continuance of temporalenjoyments, we must have God as our Friend. See also Lu 12:33. When Godcrosses our temporal affairs, and we meet with trouble anddisappointment, we shall find the cause is, that the work we have to dofor God and our own souls is left undone, and we seek our own thingsmore than the things of Christ. How many, who plead that they cannotafford to give to pious or charitable designs, often lavish ten timesas much in needless expenses on their houses and themselves! But thoseare strangers to their own interests, who are full of care to adorn andenrich their own houses, while God's temple in their hearts lies waste.It is the great concern of every one, to apply to the necessary duty ofself-examination and communion with our own hearts concerning ourspiritual state. Sin is what we must answer for; duty is what we mustdo. But many are quick-sighted to pry into other people's ways, who arecareless of their own. If any duty has been neglected, that is noreason why it should still be so. Whatever God will take pleasure inwhen done, we ought to take pleasure in doing. Let those who have putoff their return to God, return with all their heart, while there istime.
Hag 1:12-15	<br>The people returned to God in the way of duty. In attending to God'sministers, we must have respect to him that sent them. The word of theLord has success, when by his grace he stirs up our spirits to complywith it. It is in the day of Divine power we are made willing. When Godhas work to be done, he will either find or make men fit to do it.Every one helped, as his ability was; and this they did with a regardto the Lord as their God. Those who have lost time, need to redeemtime; and the longer we have loitered in folly, the more haste weshould make. God met them in a way of mercy. Those who work for him,have him with them; and if he be for us, who can be against us? Thisshould stir us up to be diligent.
Hag 2:1-9	<br>Those who are hearty in the Lord's service shall receive encouragementto proceed. But they could not build such a temple then, as Solomonbuilt. Though our gracious God is pleased if we do as well as we can inhis service, yet our proud hearts will scarcely let us be pleased,unless we do as well as others, whose abilities are far beyond ours.Encouragement is given the Jews to go on in the work notwithstanding.They have God with them, his Spirit and his special presence. Though hechastens their transgressions, his faithfulness does not fail. TheSpirit still remained among them. And they shall have the Messiah amongthem shortly; "He that should come." Convulsions and changes would takeplace in the Jewish church and state, but first should come greatrevolutions and commotions among the nations. He shall come, as theDesire of all nations; desirable to all nations, for in him shall allthe earth be blessed with the best of blessings; long expected anddesired by all believers. The house they were building should be filledwith glory, very far beyond Solomon's temple. This house shall befilled with glory of another nature. If we have silver and gold, wemust serve and honour God with it, for the property is his. If we havenot silver and gold, we must honour him with such as we have, and hewill accept us. Let them be comforted that the glory of this latterhouse shall be greater than that of the former, in what would be beyondall the glories of the first house, the presence of the Messiah, theSon of God, the Lord of glory, personally, and in human nature. Nothingbut the presence of the Son of God, in human form and nature, couldfulfil this. Jesus is the Christ, is He that should come, and we are tolook for no other. This prophecy alone is enough to silence the Jews,and condemn their obstinate rejection of Him, concerning whom all theirprophets spake. If God be with us, peace is with us. But the Jews underthe latter temple had much trouble; but this promise is fulfilled inthat spiritual peace which Jesus Christ has by his blood purchased forall believers. All changes shall make way for Christ to be desired andvalued by all nations. And the Jews shall have their eyes opened tobehold how precious He is, whom they have hitherto rejected.
Hag 2:10-19	<br>Many spoiled this good work, by going about it with unholy hearts andhands, and were likely to gain no advantage by it. The sum of these tworules of the law is, that sin is more easily learned from others thanholiness. The impurity of their hearts and lives shall make the work oftheir hands, and all their offerings, unclean before God. The case isthe same with us. When employed in any good work, we should watch overourselves, lest we render it unclean by our corruptions. When we beginto make conscience of duty to God, we may expect his blessing; andwhoso is wise will understand the loving-kindness of the Lord. God willcurse the blessings of the wicked, and make bitter the prosperity ofthe careless; but he will sweeten the cup of affliction to those whodiligently serve him.
Hag 2:20-23	<br>The Lord will preserve Zerubbabel and the people of Judah, amidst theirenemies. Here is also foretold the establishment and continuance of thekingdom of Christ; by union with whom his people are sealed with theHoly Ghost, sealed with his image, thus distinguished from all others.Here also is foretold the changes, even to that time when the kingdomof Christ shall overthrow and occupy the place of all the empires whichopposed his cause. The promise has special reference to Christ, whodescended from Zerubbabel in a direct line, and is the sole Builder ofthe gospel temple. Our Lord Jesus is the Signet on God's right hand,for all power is given to him, and derived from him. By him, and inhim, all the promises of God are yea and amen. Whatever changes takeplace on earth, all will promote the comfort, honour, and happiness ofhis servants.
Zec 1:1-6	<br>God's almighty power and sovereign dominion, should engage andencourage sinners to repent and turn to Him. It is very desirable tohave the Lord of hosts for our friend, and very dreadful to have himfor our enemy. Review what is past, and observe the message God sent byhis servants, the prophets, to your fathers. Turn ye now from your evilways, and from your evil doings. Be persuaded to leave your sins, asthe only way to prevent approaching ruin. What is become of ourfathers, and of the prophets that preached to them? They are all deadand gone. Here they were, in the towns and countries where we live,passing and repassing in the same streets, dwelling in the same houses,trading in the same shops and exchanges, worshipping God in the sameplaces. But where are they? When they died, there was not an end ofthem; they are in eternity, in the world of spirits, the unchangeableworld to which we hasten apace. Where are they? Those of them who livedand died in sin, are in torment. Those who lived and died in Christ,are in heaven; and if we live and die as they did, we shall be withthem shortly and eternally. If they minded not their own souls, is thata reason why their posterity should ruin theirs also? The prophets aregone. Christ is a Prophet that lives for ever, but all other prophetshave a period put to their office. Oh that this consideration had itsdue weight; that dying ministers are dealing with dying people abouttheir never-dying souls, and an awful eternity, upon the brink of whichboth are standing! In another world, both we and our prophets shalllive for ever: to prepare for that world ought to be our great care inthis. The preachers died, and the hearers died, but the word of Goddied not; not one jot or title of it fell to the ground; for he isrighteous.
Zec 1:7-17	<br>The prophet saw a dark, shady grove, hidden by hills. This representedthe low, melancholy condition of the Jewish church. A man like awarrior sat on a red horse, in the midst of this shady myrtle-grove.Though the church was in a low condition, Christ was present in themidst, ready to appear for the relief of his people. Behind him wereangels ready to be employed by him, some in acts of judgment, others ofmercy, others in mixed events. Would we know something of the mysteriesof the kingdom of heaven, we must apply, not to angels, for they arethemselves learners, but to Christ himself. He is ready to teach thosehumbly desirous to learn the things of God. The nations near Judeaenjoyed peace at that time, but the state of the Jews was unsettled,which gave rise to the pleading that followed; but mercy must only behoped for through Christ. His intercession for his church prevails. TheLord answered the Angel, this Angel of the covenant, with promises ofmercy and deliverance. All the good words and comfortable words of thegospel we receive from Jesus Christ, as he received them from theFather, in answer to the prayer of his blood; and his ministers are topreach them to all the world. The earth sat still, and was at rest. Itis not uncommon for the enemies of God to be at rest in sin, while hispeople are enduring correction, harassed by temptation, disquieted byfears of wrath, or groaning under oppression and persecution. Here arepredictions which had reference to the revival of the Jews after thecaptivity, but those events were shadows of what shall take place inthe church, after the oppression of the New Testament Babylon is ended.
Zec 1:18-21	<br>The enemies of the church threaten to cut off the name of Israel. Theyare horns, emblems of power, strength, and violence. The prophet sawthem so formidable that he began to despair of the safety of every goodman, and the success of every good work; but the Lord showed him fourworkmen empowered to cut off these horns. With an eye of sense we seethe power of the enemies of the church; look which way we will, theworld shows us that; but it is only with an eye of faith that we see itsafe. The Lord shows us that. When God has work to do, he will raise upsome to do it, and others to defend it, and to protect those employedin doing it. What cause there is to look up in love and praise to theholy and eternal Spirit, who has the same care over the present andeternal interests of believers, by the holy word bringing the church toknow the wonderful things of salvation!
Zec 2:1-5	<br>The Son of David, even the Man Christ Jesus, whom the prophet sees witha measuring line in his hand, is the Master-Builder of his church. Godnotices the extent of his church, and will take care that whatevernumber of guests are brought to the wedding-supper, there shall beroom. This vision means well to Jerusalem. The walls of a city, as theydefend it, so they straiten its inhabitants; but Jerusalem shall beextended as freely as if it had no walls at all, yet shall be as safeas if it had the strongest walls. In the church of God there yet isroom for other multitudes, more than man can number. None shall berefused who trust in Christ; and He never shuts out from heaven onetrue member of the church on earth. God will be a Wall of fire roundthem, which can neither be broken through nor undermined, nor can it beassailed without danger to those who attack. This vision was to haveits full accomplishment in the gospel church, which is extended byadmitting the Gentiles into it; and which has the Son of God for itsPrince and Protector; especially in the glorious times yet to come.
Zec 2:6-9	<br>If God will build Jerusalem for the people and their comfort, they mustinhabit it for him and his glory. The promises and privileges withwhich God's people are blessed, should engage us to join them, whateverit costs us. When Zion is enlarged to make room for all God's Israel,it is the greatest madness for any of them to stay in Babylon. Thecaptivity of a sinful state is by no means to be continued in, though aman may be easy in worldly matters. Escape for thy life, look notbehind thee. Christ has proclaimed that deliverance to the captives,which he has himself wrought out, and it concerns every one to resolvethat sin shall not have dominion over him. Those who would be foundamong God's children, must save themselves from this world, see Ac2:40. What Christ will do for his church, shall be an evident proof ofGod's care and affection. He that touches you, touches the apple of hiseye. This is a strong expression of God's love to his church. He takeswhat is done against her as done against the tenderest part of the eye,to which the least touch is a great offence. Christ is sent to be theProtector of his church.
Zec 2:10-13	<br>Here is a prediction of the coming of Christ in human nature. Manynations in that day would renounce idolatry, and God will own those forhis people who join him with purpose of heart. Glorious times areforetold as a prophecy of our Lord's coming and kingdom. God is aboutto do something unexpected, and very surprising, and to plead hispeople's cause, which had long seemed neglected. Silently submit to hisholy will, and patiently wait the event; assured that God will completeall his work. He will ere long come to judgment, to complete thesalvation of his people, and to punish the inhabitants of the earth fortheir sins.
Zec 3:1-5	<br>The angel showed Joshua, the high priest, to Zechariah, in a vision.Guilt and corruption are great discouragements when we stand beforeGod. By the guilt of the sins committed by us, we are liable to thejustice of God; by the power of sin that dwells in us, we are hatefulto the holiness of God. Even God's Israel are in danger on theseaccounts; but they have relief from Jesus Christ, who is made of God tous both righteousness and sanctification. Joshua, the high priest, isaccused as a criminal, but is justified. When we stand before God, tominister to him, or stand up for God, we must expect to meet all theresistance Satan's subtlety and malice can give. Satan is checked byone that has conquered him, and many times silenced him. Those whobelong to Christ, will find him ready to appear for them, when Satanappears most strongly against them. A converted soul is a brand pluckedout of the fire by a miracle of free grace, therefore shall not be lefta prey to Satan. Joshua appears as one polluted, but is purified; herepresents the Israel of God, who are all as an unclean thing, tillthey are washed and sanctified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and bythe Spirit of our God. Israel now were free from idolatry, but therewere many things amiss in them. There were spiritual enemies warringagainst them, more dangerous than any neighbouring nations. Christloathed the filthiness of Joshua's garments, yet did not put him away.Thus God by his grace does with those whom he chooses to be priests tohimself. The guilt of sin is taken away by pardoning mercy, and thepower of it is broken by renewing grace. Thus Christ washes those fromtheir sins in his own blood, whom he makes kings and priests to ourGod. Those whom Christ makes spiritual priests, are clothed with thespotless robe of his righteousness, and appear before God in that; andwith the graces of his Spirit, which are ornaments to them. Therighteousness of saints, both imputed and implanted, is the fine linen,clean and white, with which the bride, the Lamb's wife, is arrayed, Re19:8. Joshua is restored to former honours and trusts. The crown of thepriesthood is put on him. When the Lord designs to restore and revivereligion, he stirs up prophets and people to pray for it.
Zec 3:6-10	<br>All whom God calls to any office he finds fit, or makes so. The Lordwill cause the sins of the believer to pass away by his sanctifyinggrace, and will enable him to walk in newness of life. As the promisesmade to David often pass into promises of the Messiah, so the promisesto Joshua look forward to Christ, of whose priesthood Joshua's was ashadow. Whatever trials we pass through, whatever services we perform,our whole dependence must rest on Christ, the Branch of righteousness.He is God's servant, employed in his work, obedient to his will,devoted to his honour and glory. He is the Branch from which all ourfruit must be gathered. The eye of his Father was upon him, especiallyin his sufferings, and when he was buried in the grave, as thefoundation-stones are under ground, out of men's sight. But theprophecy rather denotes the attention paid to this preciousCorner-stone. All believers, from the beginning, had looked forward toit in the types and predictions. All believers, after Christ's coming,would look to it with faith, hope, and love. Christ shall appear forall his chosen, as the high priest when before the Lord, with the namesof all Israel graven in the precious stones of his breastplate. WhenGod gave a remnant to Christ, to be brought through grace to glory,then he engraved this precious stone. By him sin shall be taken away,both the guilt and the dominion of it; he did it in one day, that dayin which he suffered and died. What should terrify when sin is takenaway? Then nothing can hurt, and we sit down under Christ's shadow withdelight, and are sheltered by it. And gospel grace, coming with power,makes men forward to draw others to it.
Zec 4:1-7	<br>The prophet's spirit was willing to attend, but the flesh was weak. Weshould beg of God that, whenever he speaks to us, he would awaken us,and we should then stir up ourselves. The church is a goldencandlestick, or lamp-bearer, set up for enlightening this dark world,and holding forth the light of Divine revelation. Two olive trees wereseen, one on each side the candlestick, from which oil flowed into thebowl without ceasing. God brings to pass his gracious purposesconcerning his church, without any art or labour of man; sometimes hemakes use of his instruments, yet he needs them not. This representedthe abundance of Divine grace, for the enlightening and making holy theministers and members of the church, and which cannot be procured orprevented by any human power. The vision assures us that the good workof building the temple, should be brought to a happy end. Thedifficulty is represented as a great mountain. But all difficultiesshall vanish, and all the objections be got over. Faith will removemountains, and make them plains. Christ is our Zerubbabel; mountains ofdifficulty were in the way of his undertaking, but nothing is too hardfor him. What comes from the grace of God, may, in faith, be committedto the grace of God, for he will not forsake the work of his own hands.
Zec 4:8-10	<br>The exact fulfilment of Scripture prophecies is a convincing proof oftheir Divine original. Though the instruments be weak and unlikely, yetGod often chooses such, to bring about great things by them. Let notthe dawning light be despised; it will shine more and more to theperfect day. Those who despaired of finishing the work, shall rejoicewhen they see Zerubbabel giving directions what to do, and taking carethat the work be done. It is a comfort to us that the same all-wise,almighty Providence, which governs the earth, is in particularconversant about the church. All that have the plummet in their hands,must look up to the eyes of the Lord, have constant regard to DivineProvidence, act in dependence on its guidance and submission to itsdisposals. Let us fix our faith on Christ, and view Him carrying on hiswork according to his own glorious plan, and daily bringing hisspiritual building nearer to completion. (Zec 4:11-14)
Zec 4:11-14	<br>Zechariah desires to know what are the two olive trees. Zerubbabel andJoshua, this prince and this priest, were endued with the gifts andgraces of God's Spirit. They lived at the same time, and both wereinstruments in the work and service of God. Christ's offices of Kingand Priest were shadowed forth by them. From the union of these twooffices in his person, both God and man, the fullness of grace isreceived and imparted. They built the temple, the church of God. Sodoes Christ spiritually. Christ is not only the Messiah, the AnointedOne himself, but he is the Good Olive to his church; and from hisfulness we receive. And the Holy Spirit is the unction or anointingwhich we have received. From Christ the Olive Tree, by the Spirit theOlive Branch, all the golden oil of grace flows to believers, whichkeeps their lamps burning. Let us seek, through the intercession andbounty of the Saviour, supplies from that fulness which has hithertosufficed for all his saints, according to their trials and employments.Let us wait on him in his ordinances, desiring to be sanctified whollyin body, soul, and spirit.
Zec 5:1-4	<br>The Scriptures of the Old and New Testament are rolls, in which God haswritten the great things of his law and gospel; they are flying rolls.God's word runs very swiftly, Ps 147:15. This flying roll contains adeclaration of the righteous wrath of God against sinners. Oh that wesaw with an eye of faith the flying roll of God's curse hanging overthe guilty world as a thick cloud, not only keeping off the sunbeams ofGod's favour, but big with thunders, lightnings, and storms, ready todestroy them! How welcome then would the tidings of a Saviour be, whocame to redeem us from the curse of the law, being himself made a cursefor us! Sin is the ruin of houses and families; especially the doinghurt to others and false witness. Who knows the power of God's anger?God's curse cannot be kept out by bars or locks. While one part of thecurse of God ruins the substance of the sinner, another part will reston the soul, and sink it to everlasting punishment. All aretransgressors of the law, so we cannot escape this wrath of God, exceptwe flee for refuge to lay hold on the hope set before us in the gospel.
Zec 5:5-11	<br>In this vision the prophet sees an ephah, something in the shape of acorn measure. This betokened the Jewish nation. They are filling themeasure of their iniquity; and when it is full, they shall be deliveredinto the hands of those to whom God sold them for their sins. The womansitting in the midst of the ephah represents the sinful church andnation of the Jews, in their latter and corrupt age. Guilt is upon thesinner as a weight of lead, to sink him to the lowest hell. This seemsto mean the condemnation of the Jews, after they filled the measure oftheir iniquities by crucifying Christ and rejecting his gospel.Zechariah sees the ephah, with the woman thus pressed in it, carriedaway to some far country. This intimates that the Jews should behurried out of their own land, and forced to dwell in far countries, asthey had been in Babylon. There the ephah shall be firmly placed, andtheir sufferings shall continue far longer than in their latecaptivity. Blindness is happened unto Israel, and they are settled upontheir own unbelief. Let sinners fear to treasure up wrath against theday of wrath; for the more they multiply crimes, the faster the measurefills.
Zec 6:1-8	<br>This vision may represent the ways of Providence in the government ofthis lower world. Whatever the providences of God about us are, as topublic or private affairs, we should see them all as coming frombetween the mountains of brass, the immoveable counsels and decrees ofGod; and therefore reckon it as much our folly to quarrel with them, asit is our duty to submit to them. His providences move swiftly andstrongly as chariots, but all are directed and governed by his infinitewisdom and sovereign will. The red horses signify war and bloodshed.The black, signify the dismal consequences of war, famines,pestilences, and desolations. The white, signify the return of comfort,peace, and prosperity. The mixed colour, signify events of differentcomplexions, a day of prosperity and a day of adversity. The angels goforth as messengers of God's counsels, and ministers of his justice andmercy. And the secret motions and impulses upon the spirits of men, bywhich the designs of Providence are carried on, are these four spiritsof the heavens, which go forth from God, and fulfil what the God of thespirits of all flesh appoints. All the events which take place in theworld spring from the unchangeable counsels of the Lord, which areformed in unerring wisdom, perfect justice, truth, and goodness; andfrom history it is found that events happened about the period whenthis vision was sent to the prophet, which seem referred to therein.
Zec 6:9-15	<br>Some Jews from Babylon brought an offering to the house of God. Thosewho cannot forward a good work by their persons, must, as they areable, forward it by their purses: if some find hands, let others fillthem. Crowns are to be made, and put upon the head of Joshua. The signwas used, to make the promise more noticed, that God will, in thefulness of time, raise up a great High Priest, like Joshua, who is butthe figure of one that is to come. Christ is not only the Foundation,but the Founder of this temple, by his Spirit and grace. Glory is aburden, but not too heavy for Him to bear who upholds all things. Thecross was His glory, and he bore that; so is the crown an exceedingweight of glory, and he bears that. The counsel of peace should bebetween the priest and the throne, between the priestly and kinglyoffices of Jesus Christ. The peace and welfare of the gospel church,and of all believers, shall be wrought, though not by two severalpersons, yet by two several offices meeting in one; Christ, purchasingall peace by his priesthood, maintaining and defending it by hiskingdom. The crowns used in this solemnity must be kept in the temple,as evidence of this promise of the Messiah. Let us not think ofseparating what God has joined in his counsel of peace. We cannot cometo God by Christ as our Priest, if we refuse to have him rule over usas our King. We have no real ground to think our peace is made withGod, unless we try to keep his commandments.
Zec 7:1-7	<br>If we truly desire to know the will of God in doubtful matters, we mustnot only consult his word and ministers, but seek his direction byfervent prayer. Those who would know God's mind should consult God'sministers; and, in doubtful cases, ask advice of those whose specialbusiness it is to search the Scriptures. The Jews seemed to questionwhether they ought to continue their fasts, seeing that the city andtemple were likely to be finished. The first answer to their inquiry isa sharp reproof of hypocrisy. These fasts were not acceptable to God,unless observed in a better manner, and to better purpose. There wasthe form of duty, but no life, or soul, or power in it. Holy exercisesare to be done to God, looking to his word as our rule, and his gloryas our end, seeking to please him and obtain his favour; but self wasthe centre of all their actions. And it was not enough to weep on fastdays; they should have searched the Scriptures of the prophets, thatthey might have seen what was the ground of God's controversy withtheir fathers. Whether people are in prosperity or adversity, they mustbe called upon to leave their sins, and to do their duty.
Zec 7:8-14	<br>God's judgements upon Israel of old for their sins, were written towarn Christians. The duties required are, not keeping fasts andoffering sacrifices, but doing justly and loving mercy, which tend tothe public welfare and peace. The law of God lays restraint upon theheart. But they filled their minds with prejudices against the word ofGod. Nothing is harder than the heart of a presumptuous sinner. See thefatal consequences of this to their fathers. Great sins against theLord of hosts, bring great wrath from his power, which cannot beresisted. Sin, if regarded in the heart, will certainly spoil thesuccess of prayer. The Lord always hears the cry of the broken-heartedpenitent; yet all who die impenitent and unbelieving, will find noremedy or refuge from miseries which while here they despised anddefied, but which they then will not be able to bear.
Zec 8:1-8	<br>The sins of Zion were her worst enemies. God will take away her sins,and then no other enemies shall hurt her. Those who profess religionmust adorn their profession by godliness and honesty. When become acity of truth and a mountain of holiness, Jerusalem is peaceable andprosperous. Verses #(4,5), beautifully describe a state of greatoutward peace, attended with plenty, temperance, and contentment. Thescattered Israelites shall be brought together from all parts. God willnever leave nor forsake them in a way of mercy, for this he haspromised them; and they shall never leave nor forsake him in a way ofduty, as they have promised him. These promises were partly fulfilledin the Jewish church, betwixt the captivity and the time of Christ'scoming; and they had fuller accomplishment in the gospel church; butthe full import must be as to the future times of the Christian church,or the future restoration of the Jews. With men this is impossible, butwith God all things are possible; so far are God's thoughts and waysabove ours. In the present low state of vital godliness, we can hardlyconceive that so complete a change can be made; but a change thusextensive and glorious, can be brought to pass by the almighty power ofthe new-creating Spirit, in less time than he was pleased to employ increating the world. Let the hands of all who labour in the cause of thegospel be strong, serving the Lord in true holiness, assured that theirlabour shall not be in vain.
Zec 8:9-17	<br>Those only who lay their hands to the plough of duty, shall have themstrengthened with the promises of mercy: those who avoid their fathers'faults have the curse turned into a blessing. Those who believed thepromises, were to show their faith by their works, and to wait thefulfilment. When God is displeased, he can cause trade to decay, andset every man against his neighbour; but when he returns in mercy, allis happy and prosperous. Surely believers in Christ must not triflewith the exhortation to put away lying, and to speak every man peacewith his neighbour, to hate what the Lord hates, and to love thatwherein he delights.
Zec 8:18-23	<br>When God comes towards us in ways of mercy, we must meet him with joyand thankfulness. Therefore be faithful and honest in all yourdealings; and let it be a pleasure to you to be so, though thereby youcome short of the gains others get dishonestly; and, as much as in youlies, live peaceably with all men. Let the truths of God rule in yourheads, and let the peace of God rule in your hearts. Thus the ancientservants of God drew the notice of heathen neighbours, whose prejudiceswere softened. A great increase to the church shall be made. Hithertothe Jews had been prone to learn the idolatries of other nations: whatmore unlikely than that they should teach religion to their conquerors,and to all the principal nations of the earth! Yet this is expresslyforetold, and it came to pass. Hitherto the prophecy has beenwonderfully fulfilled, and no doubt future events will explain itfurther. It is good to be with those who have God with them; if we takeGod for our God, we must take his people for our people, and be willingto take our lot with them. But let not any one think that mere zeal,either for Jews or Gentiles, will stand in the place of personalreligion. Let us be living epistles of Christ, known and read of allmen, so that others may wish to go with us, and to have their portionwith us in the realms of bliss.
Zec 9:1-8	<br>Here are judgements foretold on several nations. While the Macedoniansand Alexander's successors were in warfare in these countries, the Lordpromised to protect his people. God's house lies in the midst of anenemy's country; his church is as a lily among thorns. God's power andgoodness are seen in her special preservation. The Lord encamps abouthis church, and while armies of proud opposers shall pass by andreturn, his eyes watch over her, so that they cannot prevail, andshortly the time will come when no exactor shall pass by her any more.
Zec 9:9-17	<br>The prophet breaks forth into a joyful representation of the coming ofthe Messiah, of whom the ancient Jews explained this prophecy. He tookthe character of their King, when he entered Jerusalem amidst thehosannas of the multitude. But his kingdom is a spiritual kingdom. Itshall not be advanced by outward force or carnal weapons. His gospelshall be preached to the world, and be received among the heathen. Asinful state is a state of bondage; it is a pit, or dungeon, in whichthere is no water, no comfort; and we are all by nature prisoners inthis pit. Through the precious blood of Christ, many prisoners of Satanhave been set at liberty from the horrible pit in which they mustotherwise have perished, without hope or comfort. While we admire Him,let us seek that his holiness and truth may be shown in our own spiritsand conduct. These promises have accomplishment in the spiritualblessings of the gospel which we enjoy by Jesus Christ. As thedeliverance of the Jews was typical of redemption by Christ, so thisinvitation speaks to all the language of the gospel call. Sinners areprisoners, but prisoners of hope; their case is sad, but not desperate;for there is hope in Israel concerning them. Christ is a Strong-hold, astrong Tower, in whom believers are safe from the fear of the wrath ofGod, the curse of the law, and the assaults of spiritual enemies. Tohim we must turn with lively faith; to him we must flee, and trust inhis name under all trials and sufferings. It is here promised that theLord would deliver his people. This passage also refers to theapostles, and the preachers of the gospel in the early ages. God wasevidently with them; his words from their lips pierced the hearts andconsciences of the hearers. They were wondrously defended inpersecution, and were filled with the influences of the Holy Spirit.They were saved by the Good Shepherd as his flock, and honoured asjewels of his crown. The gifts, graces, and consolations of the Spirit,poured forth on the day of Pentecost, Ac 2 and in succeeding times, arerepresented. Sharp have been, and still will be, the conflicts ofZion's sons, but their God will give them success. The more we areemployed, and satisfied with his goodness, the more we shall admire thebeauty revealed in the Redeemer. Whatever gifts God bestows on us, wemust serve him cheerfully with them; and, when refreshed withblessings, we must say, How great is his goodness!
Zec 10:1-5	<br>Spiritual blessings had been promised under figurative allusions toearthly plenty. Seasonable rain is a great mercy, which we may ask ofGod when there is most need of it, and we may look for it to come. Wemust in our prayers ask for mercies in their proper time. The Lordwould make bright clouds, and give showers of rain. This may be anexhortation to seek the influences of the Holy Spirit, in faith and byprayer, through which the blessings held forth in the promises areobtained and enjoyed. The prophet shows the folly of making addressesto idols, as their fathers had done. The Lord visited the remnant ofhis flock in mercy, and was about to renew their courage and strengthfor conflict and victory. Every creature is to us what God makes it tobe. Every one raised to support the nation, as a corner-stone does thebuilding, or to unite those that differ, as nails join the differenttimbers, must come from the Lord; and those employed to overcome theirenemies, must have strength and success from him. This may be appliedto Christ; to him we must look to raise up persons to unite, support,and defend his people. He never will say, Seek ye me in vain.
Zec 10:6-12	<br>Here are precious promises to the people of God, which look to thestate of the Jews, and even to the latter days of the church. Preachingthe gospel is God's call for souls to come to Jesus Christ. Those whomChrist redeemed by his blood, God will gather by his grace.Difficulties shall be got over easily, and effectually, as those in theway of the deliverance out of Egypt. God himself will be theirstrength, and their song. When we resist, and so overcome our spiritualenemies, then our hearts shall rejoice. If God strengthen us, we mustbestir ourselves in all the duties of the Christian life, must beactive in the work of God; and we must do all in the name of the LordJesus.
Zec 11:1-3	<br>In figurative expressions, that destruction of Jerusalem, and of theJewish church and nation, is foretold, which our Lord Jesus, when thetime was at hand, prophesied plainly and expressly. How can the firtrees stand, if the cedars fall? The falls of the wise and good intosin, and the falls of the rich and great into trouble, are loud alarmsto those every way their inferiors. It is sad with a people, when thosewho should be as shepherds to them, are as young lions. The pride ofJordan was the thickets on the banks; and when the river overflowed thebanks, the lions came up from them roaring. Thus the doom of Jerusalemmay alarm other churches.
Zec 11:4-14	<br>Christ came into this world for judgment to the Jewish church andnation, which were wretchedly corrupt and degenerate. Those have theirminds wofully blinded, who do ill, and justify themselves in it; butGod will not hold those guiltless who hold themselves so. How can we goto God to beg a blessing on unlawful methods of getting wealth, or toreturn thanks for success in them? There was a general decay ofreligion among them, and they regarded it not. The Good Shepherd wouldfeed his flock, but his attention would chiefly be directed to thepoor. As an emblem, the prophet seems to have taken two staves; Beauty,denoted the privileges of the Jewish nation, in their nationalcovenant; the other he called Bands, denoting the harmony whichhitherto united them as the flock of God. But they chose to cleave tofalse teachers. The carnal mind and the friendship of the world areenmity to God; and God hates all the workers of iniquity: it is easy toforesee what this will end in. The prophet demanded wages, or a reward,and received thirty pieces of silver. By Divine direction he cast it tothe potter, as in disdain for the smallness of the sum. This shadowedforth the bargain of Judas to betray Christ, and the final method ofapplying it. Nothing ruins a people so certainly, as weakening thebrotherhood among them. This follows the dissolving of the covenantbetween God and them: when sin abounds, love waxes cold, and civilcontests follow. No wonder if those fall out among themselves, who haveprovoked God to fall out with them. Wilful contempt of Christ is thegreat cause of men's ruin. And if professors rightly valued Christ,they would not contend about little matters.
Zec 11:15-17	<br>God, having showed the misery of this people in their being justly leftby the Good Shepherd, shows their further misery in being abused byfoolish shepherds. The description suits the character Christ gives ofthe scribes and Pharisees. They never do any thing to support the weak,or comfort the feeble-minded; but seek their own ease, while they arebarbarous to the flock. The idol shepherd has the garb and appearanceof a shepherd, receives submission, and is supported at much expense;but he leaves the flock to perish through neglect, or leads them toruin by his example. This suits many in different churches and nations,but the warning had an awful fulfilment in the Jewish teachers. Andwhile such deceive others to their ruin, they will themselves have thedeepest condemnation.
Zec 12:1-8	<br>Here is a Divine prediction, which will be a heavy burden to all theenemies of the church. But it is for Israel; for their comfort andbenefit. It is promised that God will make foolish the counsels, andweaken the courage of the enemies of the church. The exact meaning isnot clear; but God often begins by calling the poor and despised; andin that day even the feeblest will resemble David, and be as eminent incourage and every thing good. Desirable indeed is it that the examplesand labours of Christians should render them as fire among wood, as atorch in a sheaf, to kindle the flame of Divine love, to spreadreligion on the right hand and on the left.
Zec 12:9-14	<br>The day here spoken of, is the day of Jerusalem's defence anddeliverance, that glorious day when God will appear for the salvationof his people. In Christ's first coming he bruised the serpent's head,and broke all the powers of darkness that fought against God's kingdomamong men. In his second coming he will complete their destruction,when he shall put down all opposing rule, principality, and power; anddeath itself shall be swallowed up in that victory. The Holy Spirit isgracious and merciful, and is the Author of all grace or holiness. He,also, is the Spirit of supplications, and shows men their ignorance,want, guilt, misery, and danger. At the time here foretold, the Jewswill know who the crucified Jesus was; then they shall look by faith tohim, and mourn with the deepest sorrow, not only in public, but inprivate, even each one separately. There is a holy mourning, the effectof the pouring out of the Spirit; a mourning for sin, which quickensfaith in Christ, and qualifies for joy in God. This mourning is a fruitof the Spirit of grace, a proof of a work of grace in the soul, and ofthe Spirit of supplications. It is fulfilled in all who sorrow for sinafter a godly sort; they look to Christ crucified, and mourn for him.Looking by faith upon the cross of Christ will cause us to mourn forsin after a godly sort.
Zec 13:1-6	<br>In the time mentioned at the close of the foregoing chapter, a fountainwould be opened to the rulers and people of the Jews, in which to washaway their sins. Even the atoning blood of Christ, united with hissanctifying grace. It has hitherto been closed to the unbelievingnation of Israel; but when the Spirit of grace shall humble and softentheir hearts, he will open it to them also. This fountain opened is thepierced side of Christ. We are all as an unclean thing. Behold afountain opened for us to wash in, and streams flowing to us from thatfountain. The blood of Christ, and God's pardoning mercy in that blood,made known in the new covenant, are a fountain always flowing, thatnever can be emptied. It is opened for all believers, who as thespiritual seed of Christ, are of the house of David, and, as livingmembers of the church, are inhabitants of Jerusalem. Christ, by thepower of his grace, takes away the dominion of sin, even of belovedsins. Those who are washed in the fountain opened, as they arejustified, so they are sanctified. Souls are brought off from the worldand the flesh, those two great idols, that they may cleave to God only.The thorough reformation which will take place on the conversion ofIsrael to Christ, is here foretold. False prophets shall be convincedof their sin and folly, and return to their proper employments. Whenconvinced that we are gone out of the way of duty, we must show thetruth of our repentance by returning to it again. It is well toacknowledge those to be friends, who by severe discipline areinstrumental in bringing us to a sight of error; for faithful are thewounds of a friend, Pr 27:6. And it is always well for us to recollectthe wounds of our Saviour. Often has he been wounded by professedfriends, nay, even by his real disciples, when they act contrary to hisword.
Zec 13:7-9	<br>Here is a prophecy of the sufferings of Christ. God the Father gaveorder to the sword of his justice to awake against his Son, when hefreely made his soul an offering for sin. As God, he is called "myFellow." Christ and the Father are one. He is the Shepherd who was tolay down his life for the sheep. If a Sacrifice, he must be slain, forwithout shedding of the life-blood there was no remission. This swordmust awake against him, yet he had no sin of his own to answer for. Itmay refer to the whole of Christ's sufferings, especially his agoniesin the garden and on the cross, when he endured unspeakable anguishtill Divine justice was fully satisfied. Smite the Shepherd, and thesheep shall be scattered. This passage our Lord Jesus declares wasfulfilled, when all his disciples, in the night wherein he wasbetrayed, forsook him and fled. It has, and shall have itsaccomplishment, in the destruction of the corrupt and hypocritical partof the professed church. Because of the sin of the Jews in rejectingand crucifying Christ, and in opposing his gospel, the Romans woulddestroy the greater part. But a remnant would be saved. And if we arehis people, we shall be refined as gold; he will be God, and the end ofall our trials and sufferings will be praise, and honour, and glory, atthe appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ.
Zec 14:1-7	<br>The Lord Jesus often stood upon the Mount of Olives when on earth. Heascended from thence to heaven, and then desolations and distressescame upon the Jewish nation. Such is the view taken of thisfiguratively; but many consider it as a notice of events yetunfulfilled, and that it relates to troubles of which we cannot nowform a full idea. Every believer, being related to God as his God, maytriumph in the expectation of Christ's coming in power, and speak of itwith pleasure. During a long season, the state of the church would bedeformed by sin; there would be a mixture of truth and error, ofhappiness and misery. Such is the experience of God's people, a mingledstate of grace and corruption. But, when the season is at the worst,and most unpromising, the Lord will turn darkness into light;deliverance comes when God's people have done looking for it.
Zec 14:8-15	<br>Some consider that the progress of the gospel, beginning fromJerusalem, is referred to by the living waters flowing from that city.Neither shall the gospel and means of grace, nor the graces of theSpirit wrought in the hearts of believers by those means, ever fail, byreason either of the heat of persecution, or storms of temptation, orthe blasts of any other affliction. Tremendous judgments appear to beforetold, to be sent upon those who should oppose the settlement of theJews in their own land. How far they are to be understood literally,events alone can determine. The furious rage and malice which stir upmen against each other, are faint shadows of the enmity which reignsamong those who have perished in their sins. Even the inferiorcreatures often suffer for the sin of man, and in his plagues. Thus Godwill show his displeasure against sin.
Zec 14:16-21	<br>As it is impossible for all nations literally to come to Jerusalem oncea year, to keep a feast, it is evident that a figurative meaning musthere be applied. Gospel worship is represented by the keeping of thefeast of tabernacles. Every day of a Christian's life is a day of thefeast of tabernacles; every Lord's day especially is the great day ofthe feast; therefore every day let us worship the Lord of hosts, andkeep every Lord's day with peculiar solemnity. It is just for God towithhold the blessings of grace from those who do not attend the meansof grace. It is a sin that is its own punishment; those who forsake theduty, forfeit the privilege of communion with God. A time of completepeace and purity of the church will arrive. Men will carry on theircommon affairs, and their sacred services, upon the same holyprinciples of faith, love and obedience. Real holiness shall be morediffused, because there shall be a more plentiful pouring forth of theSpirit of holiness than ever before. There shall be holiness even incommon things. Every action and every enjoyment of the believer, shouldbe so regulated according to the will of God, that it may be directedto his glory. Our whole lives should be as one constant sacrifice, oract of devotion; no selfish motive should prevail in any of ouractions. But how far is the Christian church from this state of purity!Other times, however, are at hand, and the Lord will reform and enlargehis church, as he has promised. Yet in heaven alone will perfectholiness and happiness be found.
Mal 1:1-5	<br>All advantages, either as to outward circumstances, or spiritualprivileges, come from the free love of God, who makes one to differfrom another. All the evils sinners feel and fear, are the justrecompence of their crimes, while all their hopes and comforts are fromthe unmerited mercy of the Lord. He chose his people that they might beholy. If we love him, it is because he has first loved us; yet we allare prone to undervalue the mercies of God, and to excuse our ownoffences.
Mal 1:6-14	<br>We may each charge upon ourselves what is here charged upon thepriests. Our relation to God, as our Father and Master, stronglyobliges us to fear and honour him. But they were so scornful that theyderided reproof. Sinners ruin themselves by trying to baffle theirconvictions. Those who live in careless neglect of holy ordinances, whoattend on them without reverence, and go from them under no concern, ineffect say, The table of the Lord is contemptible. They despised God'sname in what they did. It is evident that these understood not themeaning of the sacrifices, as shadowing forth the unblemished Lamb ofGod; they grudged the expense, thinking all thrown away which did notturn to their profit. If we worship God ignorantly, and withoutunderstanding, we bring the blind for sacrifice; if we do itcarelessly, if we are cold, dull, and dead in it, we bring the sick; ifwe rest in the bodily exercise, and do not make heart-work of it, webring the lame; and if we suffer vain thoughts and distractions tolodge within us, we bring the torn. And is not this evil? Is it not agreat affront to God, and a great wrong and injury to our own souls? Inorder to the acceptance of our actions with God, it is not enough to dothat which, for the matter of it, is good; but we must do it from aright principle, in a right manner, and for a right end. Our constantmercies from God, make worse our slothfulness and niggardliness, in ourreturns of duty to God. A spiritual worship shall be established.Incense shall be offered to God's name, which signifies prayer andpraise. And it shall be a pure offering. When the hour came, in whichthe true worshippers worshipped the Father in Spirit and in truth, thenthis incense was offered, even this pure offering. We may rely on God'smercy for pardon as to the past, but not for indulgence to sin infuture. If there be a willing mind, it will be accepted, thoughdefective; but if any be a deceiver, devoting his best to Satan and tohis lusts, he is under a curse. Men now, though in a different way,profane the name of the Lord, pollute his table, and show contempt forhis worship.
Mal 2:1-9	<br>What is here said of the covenant of priesthood, is true of thecovenant of grace made with all believers, as spiritual priests. It isa covenant of life and peace; it assures all believers of allhappiness, both in this world and in that to come. It is an honour toGod's servants to be employed as his messengers. The priest's lipsshould not keep knowledge from his people, but keep it for them. Thepeople are all concerned to know the will of the Lord. We must not onlyconsult the written word, but desire instruction and advice from God'smessengers, in the affairs of our souls. Ministers must exertthemselves to the utmost for the conversion of sinners; and even amongthose called Israelites, there are many to be turned from iniquity.Those ministers, and those only, are likely to turn men from sin, whopreach sound doctrine, and live holy lives according to the Scripture.Many departed from this way; thus they misled the people. Such as walkwith God in peace and righteousness, and turn others from sin, honourGod; he will honour them, while those who despise him shall be lightlyesteemed.
Mal 2:10-17	<br>Corrupt practices are the fruit of corrupt principles; and he who isfalse to his God, will not be true to his fellow mortals. In contemptof the marriage covenant, which God instituted, the Jews put away thewives they had of their own nation, probably to make room for strangewives. They made their lives bitter to them; yet, in the sight ofothers, they pretend to be tender of them. Consider she is thy wife;thy own; the nearest relation thou hast in the world. The wife is to belooked on, not as a servant, but as a companion to the husband. Thereis an oath of God between them, which is not to be trifled with. Manand wife should continue to their lives' end, in holy love and peace.Did not God make one, one Eve for one Adam? Yet God could have madeanother Eve. Wherefore did he make but one woman for one man? It wasthat the children might be made a seed to serve him. Husbands and wivesmust live in the fear of God, that their seed may be a godly seed. TheGod of Israel saith that he hateth putting away. Those who would bekept from sin, must take heed to their spirits, for there all sinbegins. Men will find that their wrong conduct in their familiessprings from selfishness, which disregards the welfare and happiness ofothers, when opposed to their own passions and fancies. It is wearisometo God to hear people justify themselves in wicked practices. Those whothink God can be a friend to sin, affront him, and deceive themselves.The scoffers said, Where is the God of judgement? but the day of theLord will come.
Mal 3:1-6	<br>The first words of this chapter seem an answer to the scoffers of thosedays. Here is a prophecy of the appearing of John the Baptist. He isChrist's harbinger. He shall prepare the way before him, by calling mento repentance. The Messiah had been long called, "He that should come,"and now shortly he will come. He is the Messenger of the covenant.Those who seek Jesus, shall find pleasure in him, often when not lookedfor. The Lord Jesus, prepares the sinner's heart to be his temple, bythe ministry of his word and the convictions of his Spirit, and heenters it as the Messenger of peace and consolation. No hypocrite orformalist can endure his doctrine, or stand before his tribunal. Christcame to distinguish men, to separate between the precious and the vile.He shall sit as a Refiner. Christ, by his gospel, shall purify andreform his church, and by his Spirit working with it, shall regenerateand cleanse souls. He will take away the dross found in them. He willseparate their corruptions, which render their faculties worthless anduseless. The believer needs not fear the fiery trial of afflictions andtemptations, by which the Saviour refines his gold. He will take careit is not more intense or longer than is needful for his good; and thistrial will end far otherwise than that of the wicked. Christ will, byinterceding for them, make them accepted. Where no fear of God is, nogood is to be expected. Evil pursues sinners. God is unchangeable. Andthough the sentence against evil works be not executed speedily, yet itwill be executed; the Lord is as much an enemy to sin as ever. We mayall apply this to ourselves. Because we have to do with a God thatchanges not, therefore it is that we are not consumed; because hiscompassions fail not.
Mal 3:7-12	<br>The men of that generation turned away from God, they had not kept hisordinances. God gives them a gracious call. But they said, Whereinshall we return? God notices what returns our hearts make to the callsof his word. It shows great perverseness in sin, when men makeafflictions excuses for sin, which are sent to part between them andtheir sins. Here is an earnest exhortation to reform. God must beserved in the first place; and the interest of our souls ought to bepreferred before that of our bodies. Let them trust God to provide fortheir comfort. God has blessings ready for us, but through the weaknessof our faith and the narrowness of our desires, we have not room toreceive them. He who makes trial will find nothing is lost by honouringthe Lord with his substance.
Mal 3:13-18	<br>Among the Jews at this time, some plainly discovered themselves to bechildren of the wicked one. The yoke of Christ is easy. But those whowork wickedness, tempt God by presumptuous sins. Judge of things asthey will appear when the doom of these proud sinners comes to beexecuted. Those that feared the Lord, spake kindly, for preserving andpromoting mutual love, when sin thus abounded. They spake one toanother, in the language of those that fear the Lord, and think on hisname. As evil communications corrupt good minds and manners, so goodcommunications confirm them. A book of remembrance was written beforeGod. He will take care that his children perish not with those thatbelieve not. They shall be vessels of mercy and honour, when the restare made vessels of wrath and dishonour. The saints are God's jewels;they are dear to him. He will preserve them as his jewels, when theearth is burned up like dross. Those who now own God for theirs, hewill then own for his. It is our duty to serve God with the dispositionof children; and he will not have his children trained up in idleness;they must do him service from a principle of love. Even God's childrenstand in need of sparing mercy. All are righteous or wicked, such asserve God, or such as serve him not: all are going to heaven or tohell. We are often deceived in our opinions concerning both the one andthe other; but at the bar of Christ, every man's character will beknown. As to ourselves, we have need to think among which we shall haveour lot; and, as to others, we must judge nothing before the time. Butin the end all the world will confess that those alone were wise andhappy, who served the Lord and trusted in Him.
Mal 4:1-3	<br>Here is a reference to the first and to the second coming of Christ:God has fixed the day of both. Those who do wickedly, who do not fearGod's anger, shall feel it. It is certainly to be applied to the day ofjudgment, when Christ shall be revealed in flaming fire; to executejudgment on the proud, and all that do wickedly. In both, Christ is arejoicing Light to those who serve him faithfully. By the Sun ofRighteousness we understand Jesus Christ. Through him believers arejustified and sanctified, and so are brought to see light. Hisinfluences render the sinner holy, joyful, and fruitful. It isapplicable to the graces and comforts of the Holy Spirit, brought intothe souls of men. Christ gave the Spirit to those who are his, to shinein their hearts, and to be a Comforter to them, a Sun and a Shield.That day which to the wicked will burn as an oven, will to therighteous be bright as the morning; it is what they wait for, more thanthose that wait for the morning. Christ came as the Sun, to bring, notonly light to a dark world, but health to a distempered world. Soulsshall increase in knowledge and spiritual strength. Their growth is asthat of calves of the stall, not as the flower of the field, which isslender and weak, and soon withers. The saints' triumphs are all owingto God's victories; it is not they that do this, but God who does itfor them. Behold another day is coming, far more dreadful to all thatwork wickedness than any which is gone before. How great then thehappiness of the believer, when he goes from the darkness and misery ofthis world, to rejoice in the Lord for evermore!
Mal 4:4-6	<br>Here is a solemn conclusion, not only of this prophecy, but of the OldTestament. Conscience bids us remember the law. Though we have notprophets, yet, as long as we have Bibles, we may keep up our communionwith God. Let others boast in their proud reasoning, and call itenlightening, but let us keep near to that sacred word, through whichthis Sun of Righteousness shines upon the souls of his people. Theymust keep up a believing expectation of the gospel of Christ, and mustlook for the beginning of it. John the Baptist preached repentance andreformation, as Elijah had done. The turning of souls to God and theirduty, is the best preparation of them for the great and dreadful day ofthe Lord. John shall preach a doctrine that shall reach men's hearts,and work a change in them. Thus he shall prepare the way for thekingdom of heaven. The Jewish nation, by wickedness, laid themselvesopen to the curse. God was ready to bring ruin upon them; but he willonce more try whether they will repent and return; therefore he sentJohn the Baptist to preach repentance to them. Let the believer waitwith patience for his release, and cheerfully expect the great day,when Christ shall come the second time to complete our salvation. Butthose must expect to be smitten with a sword, with a curse, who turnnot to Him that smites them with a rod. None can expect to escape thecurse of God's broken law, nor to enjoy the happiness of his chosen andredeemed people, unless their hearts are turned from sin and the world,to Christ and holiness. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with usall. Amen.
Mat 1:1-17	<br>Concerning this genealogy of our Saviour, observe the chief intention.It is not a needless genealogy. It is not a vain-glorious one, as thoseof great men often are. It proves that our Lord Jesus is of the nationand family out of which the Messiah was to arise. The promise of theblessing was made to Abraham and his seed; of the dominion, to Davidand his seed. It was promised to Abraham that Christ should descendfrom him, Ge 12:3; 22:18; and to David that he should descend from him,2Sa 7:12; Ps 89:3, &c.; 132:11; and, therefore, unless Jesus is a sonof David, and a son of Abraham, he is not the Messiah. Now this is hereproved from well-known records. When the Son of God was pleased to takeour nature, he came near to us, in our fallen, wretched condition; buthe was perfectly free from sin: and while we read the names in hisgenealogy, we should not forget how low the Lord of glory stooped tosave the human race.
Mat 1:18-25	<br>Let us look to the circumstances under which the Son of God enteredinto this lower world, till we learn to despise the vain honours ofthis world, when compared with piety and holiness. The mystery ofChrist's becoming man is to be adored, not curiously inquired into. Itwas so ordered that Christ should partake of our nature, yet that heshould be pure from the defilement of original sin, which has beencommunicated to all the race of Adam. Observe, it is the thoughtful,not the unthinking, whom God will guide. God's time to come withinstruction to his people, is when they are at a loss. Divine comfortsmost delight the soul when under the pressure of perplexed thoughts.Joseph is told that Mary should bring forth the Saviour of the world.He was to call his name Jesus, a Saviour. Jesus is the same name withJoshua. And the reason of that name is clear, for those whom Christsaves, he saves from their sins; from the guilt of sin by the merit ofhis death, and from the power of sin by the Spirit of his grace. Insaving them from sin, he saves them from wrath and the curse, and allmisery, here and hereafter. Christ came to save his people, not intheir sins, but from their sins; and so to redeem them from among men,to himself, who is separate from sinners. Joseph did as the angel ofthe Lord had bidden him, speedily, without delay, and cheerfully,without dispute. By applying the general rules of the written word, weshould in all the steps of our lives, particularly the great turns ofthem, take direction from God, and we shall find this safe andcomfortable.
Mat 2:1-8	<br>Those who live at the greatest distance from the means of grace oftenuse most diligence, and learn to know the most of Christ and hissalvation. But no curious arts, or mere human learning, can direct menunto him. We must learn of Christ by attending to the word of God, as alight that shineth in a dark place, and by seeking the teaching of theHoly Spirit. And those in whose hearts the day-star is risen, to givethem any thing of the knowledge of Christ, make it their business toworship him. Though Herod was very old, and never had shown affectionfor his family, and was not himself likely to live till a new-borninfant had grown up to manhood, he began to be troubled with the dreadof a rival. He understood not the spiritual nature of the Messiah'skingdom. Let us beware of a dead faith. A man may be persuaded of manytruths, and yet may hate them, because they interfere with hisambition, or sinful indulgences. Such a belief will make him uneasy,and the more resolved to oppose the truth and the cause of God; and hemay be foolish enough to hope for success therein.
Mat 2:9-12	<br>What joy these wise men felt upon this sight of the star, none know sowell as those who, after a long and melancholy night of temptation anddesertion, under the power of a spirit of bondage, at length receivethe Spirit of adoption, witnessing with their spirits that they are thechildren of God. We may well think what a disappointment it was tothem, when they found a cottage was his palace, and his own poor motherthe only attendant he had. However, these wise men did not thinkthemselves baffled; but having found the King they sought, theypresented their gifts to him. The humble inquirer after Christ will notbe stumbled at finding him and his disciples in obscure cottages, afterhaving in vain sought them in palaces and populous cities. Is a soulbusy, seeking after Christ? Would it worship him, and does it say,Alas! I am a foolish and poor creature, and have nothing to offer?Nothing! Hast thou not a heart, though unworthy of him, dark, hard, andfoul? Give it to him as it is, and be willing that he use and disposeof it as it pleases him; he will take it, and will make it better, andthou shalt never repent having given it to him. He shall frame it tohis own likeness, and will give thee himself, and be thine for ever.The gifts the wise men presented were gold, frankincense, and myrrh.Providence sent these as a seasonable relief to Joseph and Mary intheir present poor condition. Thus our heavenly Father, who knows whathis children need, uses some as stewards to supply the wants of others,and can provide for them, even from the ends of the earth.
Mat 2:13-15	<br>Egypt had been a house of bondage to Israel, and particularly cruel tothe infants of Israel; yet it is to be a place of refuge to the holyChild Jesus. God, when he pleases, can make the worst of places servethe best of purposes. This was a trial of the faith of Joseph and Mary.But their faith, being tried, was found firm. If we and our infants areat any time in trouble, let us remember the straits in which Christ waswhen an infant.
Mat 2:16-18	<br>Herod killed all the male children, not only in Bethlehem, but in allthe villages of that city. Unbridled wrath, armed with an unlawfulpower, often carries men to absurd cruelties. It was no unrighteousthing with God to permit this; every life is forfeited to his justiceas soon as it begins. The diseases and deaths of little children areproofs of original sin. But the murder of these infants was theirmartyrdom. How early did persecution against Christ and his kingdombegin! Herod now thought that he had baffled the Old Testamentprophecies, and the efforts of the wise men in finding Christ; butwhatever crafty, cruel devices are in men's hearts, the counsel of theLord shall stand.
Mat 2:19-23	<br>Egypt may serve to sojourn in, or take shelter in, for awhile, but notto abide in. Christ was sent to the lost sheep of the house of Israel,to them he must return. Did we but look upon the world as our Egypt,the place of our bondage and banishment, and heaven only as our Canaan,our home, our rest, we should as readily arise and depart thither, whenwe are called for, as Joseph did out of Egypt. The family must settlein Galilee. Nazareth was a place held in bad esteem, and Christ wascrucified with this accusation, Jesus the Nazarene. Wherever Providenceallots the bounds of our habitation, we must expect to share thereproach of Christ; yet we may glory in being called by his name, surethat if we suffer with him, we shall also be glorified with him.
Mat 3:1-6	<br>After Malachi there was no prophet until John the Baptist came. Heappeared first in the wilderness of Judea. This was not an uninhabiteddesert, but a part of the country not thickly peopled, nor muchenclosed. No place is so remote as to shut us out from the visits ofDivine grace. The doctrine he preached was repentance; "Repent ye." Theword here used, implies a total alteration in the mind, a change in thejudgment, disposition, and affections, another and a better bias of thesoul. Consider your ways, change your minds: you have thought amiss;think again, and think aright. True penitents have other thoughts ofGod and Christ, sin and holiness, of this world and the other, thanthey had. The change of the mind produces a change of the way. That isgospel repentance, which flows from a sight of Christ, from a sense ofhis love, and from hopes of pardon and forgiveness through him. It is agreat encouragement to us to repent; repent, for your sins shall bepardoned upon your repentance. Return to God in a way of duty, and hewill, through Christ, return unto you in the way of mercy. It is stillas necessary to repent and humble ourselves, to prepare the way of theLord, as it then was. There is a great deal to be done, to make way forChrist into a soul, and nothing is more needful than the discovery ofsin, and a conviction that we cannot be saved by our own righteousness.The way of sin and Satan is a crooked way; but to prepare a way forChrist, the paths must be made straight, Heb 12:13. Those whosebusiness it is to call others to mourn for sin, and to mortify it,ought themselves to live a serious life, a life of self-denial, andcontempt of the world. By giving others this example, John made way forChrist. Many came to John's baptism, but few kept to the professionthey made. There may be many forward hearers, where there are few truebelievers. Curiosity, and love for novelty and variety, may bring manyto attend on good preaching, and to be affected for a while, who neverare subject to the power of it. Those who received John's doctrine,testified their repentance by confessing their sins. Those only areready to receive Jesus Christ as their righteousness, who are broughtwith sorrow and shame to own their guilt. The benefits of the kingdomof heaven, now at hand, were thereupon sealed to them by baptism. Johnwashed them with water, in token that God would cleanse them from alltheir iniquities, thereby intimating, that by nature and practice allwere polluted, and could not be admitted among the people of God,unless washed from their sins in the fountain Christ was to open, Zec13:1.
Mat 3:7-12	<br>To make application to the souls of the hearers, is the life ofpreaching; so it was of John's preaching. The Pharisees laid theirchief stress on outward observances, neglecting the weightier mattersof the moral law, and the spiritual meaning of their legal ceremonies.Others of them were detestable hypocrites, making their pretences toholiness a cloak for iniquity. The Sadducees ran into the oppositeextreme, denying the existence of spirits, and a future state. Theywere the scornful infidels of that time and country. There is a wrathto come. It is the great concern of every one to flee from that wrath.God, who delights not in our ruin, has warned us; he warns by thewritten word, by ministers, by conscience. And those are not worthy ofthe name of penitents, or their privileges, who say they are sorry fortheir sins, yet persist in them. It becomes penitents to be humble andlow in their own eyes, to be thankful for the least mercy, patientunder the greatest affliction, to be watchful against all appearancesof sin, to abound in every duty, and to be charitable in judgingothers. Here is a word of caution, not to trust in outward privileges.There is a great deal which carnal hearts are apt to say withinthemselves, to put aside the convincing, commanding power of the wordof God. Multitudes, by resting in the honours and mere advantages oftheir being members of an outward church, come short of heaven. Here isa word of terror to the careless and secure. Our corrupt hearts cannotbe made to produce good fruit, unless the regenerating Spirit of Christgraft the good word of God upon them. And every tree, however high ingifts and honours, however green in outward professions andperformances, if it bring not forth good fruit, the fruits meet forrepentance, is hewn down and cast into the fire of God's wrath, thefittest place for barren trees: what else are they good for? If not fitfor fruit, they are fit for fuel. John shows the design and intentionof Christ's appearing, which they were now speedily to expect. Nooutward forms can make us clean. No ordinances, by whomsoeveradministered, or after whatever mode, can supply the want of thebaptism of the Holy Ghost and of fire. The purifying and cleansingpower of the Holy Spirit alone can produce that purity of heart, andthose holy affections, which accompany salvation. It is Christ whobaptizes with the Holy Ghost. This he did in the extraordinary gifts ofthe Spirit sent upon the apostles, Ac 2:4. This he does in the gracesand comforts of the Spirit, given to those that ask him, Lu 11:13; Joh7:38,39; see Ac 11:16. Observe here, the outward church is Christ'sfloor, Isa 21:10. True believers are as wheat, substantial, useful, andvaluable; hypocrites are as chaff, light and empty, useless andworthless, carried about with every wind; these are mixed, good andbad, in the same outward communion. There is a day coming when thewheat and chaff shall be separated. The last judgment will be thedistinguishing day, when saints and sinners shall be parted for ever.In heaven the saints are brought together, and no longer scattered;they are safe, and no longer exposed; separated from corrupt neighbourswithout, and corrupt affections within, and there is no chaff amongthem. Hell is the unquenchable fire, which will certainly be theportion and punishment of hypocrites and unbelievers. Here life anddeath, good and evil, are set before us: according as we now are in thefield, we shall be then in the floor.
Mat 3:13-17	<br>Christ's gracious condescensions are so surprising, that even thestrongest believers at first can hardly believe them; so deep andmysterious, that even those who know his mind well, are apt to startobjections against the will of Christ. And those who have much of theSpirit of God while here, see that they need to apply to Christ formore. Christ does not deny that John had need to be baptized of him,yet declares he will now be baptized of John. Christ is now in a stateof humiliation. Our Lord Jesus looked upon it as well becoming him tofulfil all righteousness, to own every Divine institution, and to showhis readiness to comply with all God's righteous precepts. In andthrough Christ, the heavens are opened to the children of men. Thisdescent of the Spirit upon Christ, showed that he was endued with hissacred influences without measure. The fruit of the Spirit is love,joy, peace, long-suffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness,temperance. At Christ's baptism there was a manifestation of the threePersons in the sacred Trinity. The Father confirming the Son to beMediator; the Son solemnly entering upon the work; the Holy Spiritdescending on him, to be through his mediation communicated to hispeople. In Him our spiritual sacrifices are acceptable, for He is thealtar that sanctifies every gift, 1Pe 2:5. Out of Christ, God is aconsuming fire, but in Christ, a reconciled Father. This is the sum ofthe gospel, which we must by faith cheerfully embrace.
Mat 4:1-11	<br>Concerning Christ's temptation, observe, that directly after he wasdeclared to be the Son of God, and the Saviour of the world, he wastempted; great privileges, and special tokens of Divine favour, willnot secure any from being tempted. But if the Holy Spirit witness toour being adopted as children of God, that will answer all thesuggestions of the evil spirit. Christ was directed to the combat. Ifwe presume upon our own strength, and tempt the devil to tempt us, weprovoke God to leave us to ourselves. Others are tempted, when drawnaside of their own lust, and enticed, Jas 1:14; but our Lord Jesus hadno corrupt nature, therefore he was tempted only by the devil. In thetemptation of Christ it appears that our enemy is subtle, spiteful, andvery daring; but he can be resisted. It is a comfort to us that Christsuffered, being tempted; for thus it appears that our temptations, ifnot yielded to, are not sins, they are afflictions only. Satan aimed inall his temptations, to bring Christ to sin against God. 1. He temptedhim to despair of his Father's goodness, and to distrust his Father'scare concerning him. It is one of the wiles of Satan to take advantageof our outward condition; and those who are brought into straits haveneed to double their guard. Christ answered all the temptations ofSatan with "It is written;" to set us an example, he appealed to whatwas written in the Scriptures. This method we must take, when at anytime we are tempted to sin. Let us learn not to take any wrong coursesfor our supply, when our wants are ever so pressing: in some way orother the Lord will provide. 2. Satan tempted Christ to presume uponhis Father's power and protection, in a point of safety. Nor are anyextremes more dangerous than despair and presumption, especially in theaffairs of our souls. Satan has no objection to holy places as thescene of his assaults. Let us not, in any place, be off our watch. Theholy city is the place, where he does, with the greatest advantage,tempt men to pride and presumption. All high places are slipperyplaces; advancements in the world makes a man a mark for Satan to shoothis fiery darts at. Is Satan so well versed in Scripture as to be ableto quote it readily? He is so. It is possible for a man to have hishead full of Scripture notions, and his mouth full of Scriptureexpressions, while his heart is full of bitter enmity to God and to allgoodness. Satan misquoted the words. If we go out of our way, out ofthe way of our duty, we forfeit the promise, and put ourselves out ofGod's protection. This passage, De 8:3, made against the tempter,therefore he left out part. This promise is firm and stands good. Butshall we continue in sin, that grace may abound? No. 3. Satan temptedChrist to idolatry with the offer of the kingdoms of the world, and theglory of them. The glory of the world is the most charming temptationto the unthinking and unwary; by that men are most easily imposed upon.Christ was tempted to worship Satan. He rejected the proposal withabhorrence. "Get thee hence, Satan!" Some temptations are openlywicked; and they are not merely to be opposed, but rejected at once. Itis good to be quick and firm in resisting temptation. If we resist thedevil he will flee from us. But the soul that deliberates is almostovercome. We find but few who can decidedly reject such baits as Satanoffers; yet what is a man profited if he gain the whole world, and losehis own soul? Christ was succoured after the temptation, for hisencouragement to go on in his undertaking, and for our encouragement totrust in him; for as he knew, by experience, what it was to suffer,being tempted, so he knew what it was to be succoured, being tempted;therefore we may expect, not only that he will feel for his temptedpeople, but that he will come to them with seasonable relief.
Mat 4:12-17	<br>It is just with God to take the gospel and the means of grace, fromthose that slight them and thrust them away. Christ will not stay longwhere he is not welcome. Those who are without Christ, are in the dark.They were sitting in this condition, a contented posture; they chose itrather than light; they were willingly ignorant. When the gospel comes,light comes; when it comes to any place, when it comes to any soul, itmakes day there. Light discovers and directs; so does the gospel. Thedoctrine of repentance is right gospel doctrine. Not only the austereJohn Baptist, but the gracious Jesus, preached repentance. There isstill the same reason to do so. The kingdom of heaven was not reckonedto be fully come, till the pouring out of the Holy Spirit afterChrist's ascension.
Mat 4:18-22	<br>When Christ began to preach, he began to gather disciples, who shouldbe hearers, and afterwards preachers of his doctrine, who should bewitnesses of his miracles, and afterwards testify concerning them. Hewent not to Herod's court, not to Jerusalem, among the chief priestsand the elders, but to the sea of Galilee, among the fishermen. Thesame power which called Peter and Andrew, could have wrought upon Annasand Caiaphas, for with God nothing is impossible. But Christ choosesthe foolish things of the world to confound the wise. Diligence in anhonest calling is pleasing to Christ, and it is no hinderance to a holylife. Idle people are more open to the temptations of Satan than to thecalls of God. It is a happy and hopeful thing to see children carefulof their parents, and dutiful. When Christ comes, it is good to befound doing. Am I in Christ? is a very needful question to askourselves; and, next to that, Am I in my calling? They had followedChrist before, as common disciples, Joh 1:37; now they must leave theircalling. Those who would follow Christ aright, must, at his command,leave all things to follow him, must be ready to part with them. Thisinstance of the power of the Lord Jesus encourages us to depend uponhis grace. He speaks, and it is done.
Mat 4:23-25	<br>Wherever Christ went, he confirmed his Divine mission by miracles,which were emblems of the healing power of his doctrine, and theinfluences of the Spirit which accompanied it. We do not now find theSaviour's miraculous healing power in our bodies; but if we are curedby medicine, the praise is equally his. Three general words are hereused. He healed every sickness or disease; none was too bad; none toohard, for Christ to heal with a word. Three diseases are named; thepalsy, which is the greatest weakness of the body; lunacy, which is thegreatest malady of the mind; and possession of the devil, which is thegreatest misery and calamity of both; yet Christ healed all, and bythus curing bodily diseases, showed that his great errand into theworld was to cure spiritual maladies. Sin is the sickness, disease, andtorment of the soul: Christ came to take away sin, and so to heal thesoul.
Mat 5:1,2	<br>None will find happiness in this world or the next, who do not seek itfrom Christ by the rule of his word. He taught them what was the evilthey should abhor, and what the good they should seek and abound in.
Mat 5:3-12	<br>Our Saviour here gives eight characters of blessed people, whichrepresent to us the principal graces of a Christian. 1. The poor inspirit are happy. These bring their minds to their condition, when itis a low condition. They are humble and lowly in their own eyes. Theysee their want, bewail their guilt, and thirst after a Redeemer. Thekingdom of grace is of such; the kingdom of glory is for them. 2. Thosethat mourn are happy. That godly sorrow which worketh true repentance,watchfulness, a humble mind, and continual dependence for acceptance onthe mercy of God in Christ Jesus, with constant seeking the HolySpirit, to cleanse away the remaining evil, seems here to be intended.Heaven is the joy of our Lord; a mountain of joy, to which our way isthrough a vale of tears. Such mourners shall be comforted by their God.3. The meek are happy. The meek are those who quietly submit to God;who can bear insult; are silent, or return a soft answer; who, in theirpatience, keep possession of their own souls, when they can scarcelykeep possession of anything else. These meek ones are happy, even inthis world. Meekness promotes wealth, comfort, and safety, even in thisworld. 4. Those who hunger and thirst after righteousness are happy.Righteousness is here put for all spiritual blessings. These arepurchased for us by the righteousness of Christ, confirmed by thefaithfulness of God. Our desires of spiritual blessings must beearnest. Though all desires for grace are not grace, yet such a desireas this, is a desire of God's own raising, and he will not forsake thework of his own hands. 5. The merciful are happy. We must not only bearour own afflictions patiently, but we must do all we can to help thosewho are in misery. We must have compassion on the souls of others, andhelp them; pity those who are in sin, and seek to snatch them as brandsout of the burning. 6. The pure in heart are happy; for they shall seeGod. Here holiness and happiness are fully described and put together.The heart must be purified by faith, and kept for God. Create in mesuch a clean heart, O God. None but the pure are capable of seeing God,nor would heaven be happiness to the impure. As God cannot endure tolook upon their iniquity, so they cannot look upon his purity. 7. Thepeace-makers are happy. They love, and desire, and delight in peace;and study to be quiet. They keep the peace that it be not broken, andrecover it when it is broken. If the peace-makers are blessed, woe tothe peace-breakers! 8. Those who are persecuted for righteousness' sakeare happy. This saying is peculiar to Christianity; and it is morelargely insisted upon than any of the rest. Yet there is nothing in oursufferings that can merit of God; but God will provide that those wholose for him, though life itself, shall not lose by him in the end.Blessed Jesus! how different are thy maxims from those of men of thisworld! They call the proud happy, and admire the gay, the rich, thepowerful, and the victorious. May we find mercy from the Lord; may webe owned as his children, and inherit his kingdom. With theseenjoyments and hopes, we may cheerfully welcome low or painfulcircumstances.
Mat 5:13-16	<br>Ye are the salt of the earth. Mankind, lying in ignorance andwickedness, were as a vast heap, ready to putrify; but Christ sentforth his disciples, by their lives and doctrines to season it withknowledge and grace. If they are not such as they should be, they areas salt that has lost its savour. If a man can take up the professionof Christ, and yet remain graceless, no other doctrine, no other means,can make him profitable. Our light must shine, by doing such good worksas men may see. What is between God and our souls, must be kept toourselves; but that which is of itself open to the sight of men, wemust study to make suitable to our profession, and praiseworthy. Wemust aim at the glory of God.
Mat 5:17-20	<br>Let none suppose that Christ allows his people to trifle with anycommands of God's holy law. No sinner partakes of Christ's justifyingrighteousness, till he repents of his evil deeds. The mercy revealed inthe gospel leads the believer to still deeper self-abhorrence. The lawis the Christian's rule of duty, and he delights therein. If a man,pretending to be Christ's disciple, encourages himself in any alloweddisobedience to the holy law of God, or teaches others to do the same,whatever his station or reputation among men may be, he can be no truedisciple. Christ's righteousness, imputed to us by faith alone, isneeded by every one that enters the kingdom of grace or of glory; butthe new creation of the heart to holiness, produces a thorough changein a man's temper and conduct.
Mat 5:21-26	<br>The Jewish teachers had taught, that nothing except actual murder wasforbidden by the sixth commandment. Thus they explained away itsspiritual meaning. Christ showed the full meaning of this commandment;according to which we must be judged hereafter, and therefore ought tobe ruled now. All rash anger is heart murder. By our brother, here, weare to understand any person, though ever so much below us, for we areall made of one blood. "Raca," is a scornful word, and comes frompride: "Thou fool," is a spiteful word, and comes from hatred.Malicious slanders and censures are poison that kills secretly andslowly. Christ told them that how light soever they made of these sins,they would certainly be called into judgment for them. We oughtcarefully to preserve Christian love and peace with all our brethren;and if at any time there is a quarrel, we should confess our fault,humble ourselves to our brother, making or offering satisfaction forwrong done in word or deed: and we should do this quickly; because,till this is done, we are unfit for communion with God in holyordinances. And when we are preparing for any religious exercises, itis good for us to make that an occasion of serious reflection andself-examination. What is here said is very applicable to our beingreconciled to God through Christ. While we are alive, we are in the wayto his judgement-seat; after death, it will be too late. When weconsider the importance of the case, and the uncertainty of life, howneedful it is to seek peace with God, without delay!
Mat 5:27-32	<br>Victory over the desires of the heart, must be attended with painfulexertions. But it must be done. Every thing is bestowed to save us fromour sins, not in them. All our senses and powers must be kept fromthose things which lead to transgression. Those who lead others intotemptation to sin, by dress or in other ways, or leave them in it, orexpose them to it, make themselves guilty of their sin, and will beaccountable for it. If painful operations are submitted to, that ourlives may be saved, what ought our minds to shrink from, when thesalvation of our souls is concerned? There is tender mercy under allthe Divine requirements, and the grace and consolations of the Spiritwill enable us to attend to them.
Mat 5:33-37	<br>There is no reason to consider that solemn oaths in a court of justice,or on other proper occasions, are wrong, provided they are taken withdue reverence. But all oaths taken without necessity, or in commonconversation, must be sinful, as well as all those expressions whichare appeals to God, though persons think thereby to evade the guilt ofswearing. The worse men are, the less they are bound by oaths; thebetter they are, the less there is need for them. Our Lord does notenjoin the precise terms wherein we are to affirm or deny, but such aconstant regard to truth as would render oaths unnecessary.
Mat 5:38-42	<br>The plain instruction is, Suffer any injury that can be borne, for thesake of peace, committing your concerns to the Lord's keeping. And thesum of all is, that Christians must avoid disputing and striving. Ifany say, Flesh and blood cannot pass by such an affront, let themremember, that flesh and blood shall not inherit the kingdom of God;and those who act upon right principles will have most peace andcomfort.
Mat 5:43-48	<br>The Jewish teachers by "neighbour" understood only those who were oftheir own country, nation, and religion, whom they were pleased to lookupon as their friends. The Lord Jesus teaches that we must do all thereal kindness we can to all, especially to their souls. We must prayfor them. While many will render good for good, we must render good forevil; and this will speak a nobler principle than most men act by.Others salute their brethren, and embrace those of their own party, andway, and opinion, but we must not so confine our respect. It is theduty of Christians to desire, and aim at, and press towards perfectionin grace and holiness. And therein we must study to conform ourselvesto the example of our heavenly Father, 1Pe 1:15,16. Surely more is tobe expected from the followers of Christ than from others; surely morewill be found in them than in others. Let us beg of God to enable us toprove ourselves his children.
Mat 6:1-4	<br>Our Lord next warned against hypocrisy and outward show in religiousduties. What we do, must be done from an inward principle, that we maybe approved of God, not that we may be praised of men. In these verseswe are cautioned against hypocrisy in giving alms. Take heed of it. Itis a subtle sin; and vain-glory creeps into what we do, before we areaware. But the duty is not the less necessary and excellent for beingabused by hypocrites to serve their pride. The doom Christ passes, atfirst may seem a promise, but it is their reward; not the reward Godpromises to those who do good, but the reward hypocrites promisethemselves, and a poor reward it is; they did it to be seen of men, andthey are seen of men. When we take least notice of our good deedsourselves, God takes most notice of them. He will reward thee; not as amaster who gives his servant what he earns, and no more, but as aFather who gives abundantly to his son that serves him.
Mat 6:5-8	<br>It is taken for granted that all who are disciples of Christ pray. Youmay as soon find a living man that does not breathe, as a livingChristian that does not pray. If prayerless, then graceless. TheScribes and Pharisees were guilty of two great faults in prayer,vain-glory and vain repetitions. "Verily they have their reward;" if inso great a matter as is between us and God, when we are at prayer, wecan look to so poor a thing as the praise of men, it is just that itshould be all our reward. Yet there is not a secret, sudden breathingafter God, but he observes it. It is called a reward, but it is ofgrace, not of debt; what merit can there be in begging? If he does notgive his people what they ask, it is because he knows they do not needit, and that it is not for their good. So far is God from being wroughtupon by the length or words of our prayers, that the most powerfulintercessions are those which are made with groanings that cannot beuttered. Let us well study what is shown of the frame of mind in whichour prayers should be offered, and learn daily from Christ how to pray.
Mat 6:9-15	<br>Christ saw it needful to show his disciples what must commonly be thematter and method of their prayer. Not that we are tied up to the useof this only, or of this always; yet, without doubt, it is very good touse it. It has much in a little; and it is used acceptably no furtherthan it is used with understanding, and without being needlesslyrepeated. The petitions are six; the first three relate more expresslyto God and his honour, the last three to our own concerns, bothtemporal and spiritual. This prayer teaches us to seek first thekingdom of God and his righteousness, and that all other things shallbe added. After the things of God's glory, kingdom, and will, we prayfor the needful supports and comforts of this present life. Every wordhere has a lesson in it. We ask for bread; that teaches us sobriety andtemperance: and we ask only for bread; not for what we do not need. Weask for our bread; that teaches us honesty and industry: we do not askfor the bread of others, nor the bread of deceit, Pr 20:17; nor thebread of idleness, Pr 31:27, but the bread honestly gotten. We ask forour daily bread; which teaches us constantly to depend upon DivineProvidence. We beg of God to give it us; not sell it us, nor lend itus, but give it. The greatest of men must be beholden to the mercy ofGod for their daily bread. We pray, Give it to us. This teaches us acompassion for the poor. Also that we ought to pray with our families.We pray that God would give it us this day; which teaches us to renewthe desires of our souls toward God, as the wants of our bodies arerenewed. As the day comes we must pray to our heavenly Father, andreckon we could as well go a day without food, as without prayer. Weare taught to hate and dread sin while we hope for mercy, to distrustourselves, to rely on the providence and grace of God to keep us fromit, to be prepared to resist the tempter, and not to become tempters ofothers. Here is a promise, If you forgive, your heavenly Father willalso forgive. We must forgive, as we hope to be forgiven. Those whodesire to find mercy with God, must show mercy to their brethren.Christ came into the world as the great Peace-maker, not only toreconcile us to God, but one to another.
Mat 6:16-18	<br>Religious fasting is a duty required of the disciples of Christ, but itis not so much a duty itself, as a means to dispose us for otherduties. Fasting is the humbling of the soul, Ps 35:13; that is theinside of the duty; let that, therefore, be thy principal care, and asto the outside of it, covet not to let it be seen. God sees in secret,and will reward openly.
Mat 6:19-24	<br>Worldly-mindedness is a common and fatal symptom of hypocrisy, for byno sin can Satan have a surer and faster hold of the soul, under thecloak of a profession of religion. Something the soul will have, whichit looks upon as the best thing; in which it has pleasure andconfidence above other things. Christ counsels to make our best thingsthe joys and glories of the other world, those things not seen whichare eternal, and to place our happiness in them. There are treasures inheaven. It is our wisdom to give all diligence to make our title toeternal life sure through Jesus Christ, and to look on all things herebelow, as not worthy to be compared with it, and to be content withnothing short of it. It is happiness above and beyond the changes andchances of time, an inheritance incorruptible. The worldly man is wrongin his first principle; therefore all his reasonings and actionstherefrom must be wrong. It is equally to be applied to false religion;that which is deemed light is thick darkness. This is an awful, but acommon case; we should therefore carefully examine our leadingprinciples by the word of God, with earnest prayer for the teaching ofhis Spirit. A man may do some service to two masters, but he can devotehimself to the service of no more than one. God requires the wholeheart, and will not share it with the world. When two masters opposeeach other, no man can serve both. He who holds to the world and lovesit, must despise God; he who loves God, must give up the friendship ofthe world.
Mat 6:25-34	<br>There is scarcely any sin against which our Lord Jesus more warns hisdisciples, than disquieting, distracting, distrustful cares about thethings of this life. This often insnares the poor as much as the loveof wealth does the rich. But there is a carefulness about temporalthings which is a duty, though we must not carry these lawful cares toofar. Take no thought for your life. Not about the length of it; butrefer it to God to lengthen or shorten it as he pleases; our times arein his hand, and they are in a good hand. Not about the comforts ofthis life; but leave it to God to make it bitter or sweet as hepleases. Food and raiment God has promised, therefore we may expectthem. Take no thought for the morrow, for the time to come. Be notanxious for the future, how you shall live next year, or when you areold, or what you shall leave behind you. As we must not boast oftomorrow, so we must not care for to-morrow, or the events of it. Godhas given us life, and has given us the body. And what can he not dofor us, who did that? If we take care about our souls and for eternity,which are more than the body and its life, we may leave it to God toprovide for us food and raiment, which are less. Improve this as anencouragement to trust in God. We must reconcile ourselves to ourworldly estate, as we do to our stature. We cannot alter the disposalsof Providence, therefore we must submit and resign ourselves to them.Thoughtfulness for our souls is the best cure of thoughtfulness for theworld. Seek first the kingdom of God, and make religion your business:say not that this is the way to starve; no, it is the way to be wellprovided for, even in this world. The conclusion of the whole matteris, that it is the will and command of the Lord Jesus, that by dailyprayers we may get strength to bear us up under our daily troubles, andto arm us against the temptations that attend them, and then let noneof these things move us. Happy are those who take the Lord for theirGod, and make full proof of it by trusting themselves wholly to hiswise disposal. Let thy Spirit convince us of sin in the want of thisdisposition, and take away the worldliness of our hearts.
Mat 7:1-6	<br>We must judge ourselves, and judge of our own acts, but not make ourword a law to everybody. We must not judge rashly, nor pass judgmentupon our brother without any ground. We must not make the worst ofpeople. Here is a just reproof to those who quarrel with their brethrenfor small faults, while they allow themselves in greater ones. Somesins are as motes, while others are as beams; some as a gnat, others asa camel. Not that there is any sin little; if it be a mote, orsplinter, it is in the eye; if a gnat, it is in the throat; both arepainful and dangerous, and we cannot be easy or well till they are gotout. That which charity teaches us to call but a splinter in ourbrother's eye, true repentance and godly sorrow will teach us to call abeam in our own. It is as strange that a man can be in a sinful,miserable condition, and not be aware of it, as that a man should havea beam in his eye, and not consider it; but the god of this worldblinds their minds. Here is a good rule for reprovers; first reformthyself.
Mat 7:7-11	<br>Prayer is the appointed means for obtaining what we need. Pray; prayoften; make a business of prayer, and be serious and earnest in it.Ask, as a beggar asks alms. Ask, as a traveller asks the way. Seek, asfor a thing of value that we have lost; or as the merchantman thatseeks goodly pearls. Knock, as he that desires to enter into the houseknocks at the door. Sin has shut and barred the door against us; byprayer we knock. Whatever you pray for, according to the promise, shallbe given you, if God see it fit for you, and what would you have more?This is made to apply to all that pray aright; every one that askethreceiveth, whether Jew or Gentile, young or old, rich or poor, high orlow, master or servant, learned or unlearned, all are alike welcome tothe throne of grace, if they come in faith. It is explained by acomparison taken from earthly parents, and their readiness to givetheir children what they ask. Parents are often foolishly fond, but Godis all-wise; he knows what we need, what we desire, and what is fit forus. Let us never suppose our heavenly Father would bid us pray, andthen refuse to hear, or give us what would be hurtful.
Mat 7:12-14	<br>Christ came to teach us, not only what we are to know and believe, butwhat we are to do; not only toward God, but toward men; not only towardthose of our party and persuasion, but toward men in general, all withwhom we have to do. We must do that to our neighbour which we ourselvesacknowledge to be fit and reasonable. We must, in our dealings withmen, suppose ourselves in the same case and circumstances with those wehave to do with, and act accordingly. There are but two ways right andwrong, good and evil; the way to heaven and the way to hell; in the oneor other of these all are walking: there is no middle place hereafter,no middle way now. All the children of men are saints or sinners, godlyor ungodly. See concerning the way of sin and sinners, that the gate iswide, and stands open. You may go in at this gate with all your lustsabout you; it gives no check to appetites or passions. It is a broadway; there are many paths in it; there is choice of sinful ways. Thereis a large company in this way. But what profit is there in beingwilling to go to hell with others, because they will not go to heavenwith us? The way to eternal life is narrow. We are not in heaven assoon as we are got through the strait gate. Self must be denied, thebody kept under, and corruptions mortified. Daily temptations must beresisted; duties must be done. We must watch in all things, and walkwith care; and we must go through much tribulation. And yet this wayshould invite us all; it leads to life: to present comfort in thefavour of God, which is the life of the soul; to eternal bliss, thehope of which at the end of our way, should make all the difficultiesof the road easy to us. This plain declaration of Christ has beendisregarded by many who have taken pains to explain it away; but in allages the real disciple of Christ has been looked on as a singular,unfashionable character; and all that have sided with the greaternumber, have gone on in the broad road to destruction. If we wouldserve God, we must be firm in our religion. Can we often hear of thestrait gate and the narrow way, and how few there are that find it,without being in pain for ourselves, or considering whether we areentered on the narrow way, and what progress we are making in it?
Mat 7:15-20	<br>Nothing so much prevents men from entering the strait gate, andbecoming true followers of Christ, as the carnal, soothing, flatteringdoctrines of those who oppose the truth. They may be known by the driftand effects of their doctrines. Some part of their temper and conductis contrary to the mind of Christ. Those opinions come not from Godthat lead to sin.
Mat 7:21-29	<br>Christ here shows that it will not be enough to own him for our Master,only in word and tongue. It is necessary to our happiness that webelieve in Christ, that we repent of sin, that we live a holy life,that we love one another. This is his will, even our sanctification.Let us take heed of resting in outward privileges and doings, lest wedeceive ourselves, and perish eternally, as multitudes do, with a liein our right hand. Let every one that names the name of Christ, departfrom all sin. There are others, whose religion rests in bare hearing,and it goes no further; their heads are filled with empty notions.These two sorts of hearers are represented as two builders. Thisparable teaches us to hear and do the sayings of the Lord Jesus: somemay seem hard to flesh and blood, but they must be done. Christ is laidfor a foundation, and every thing besides Christ is sand. Some buildtheir hopes upon worldly prosperity; others upon an outward professionof religion. Upon these they venture; but they are all sand, too weakto bear such a fabric as our hopes of heaven. There is a storm comingthat will try every man's work. When God takes away the soul, where isthe hope of the hypocrite? The house fell in the storm, when thebuilder had most need of it, and expected it would be a shelter to him.It fell when it was too late to build another. May the Lord make uswise builders for eternity. Then nothing shall separate us from thelove of Christ Jesus. The multitudes were astonished at the wisdom andpower of Christ's doctrine. And this sermon, ever so often read over,is always new. Every word proves its Author to be Divine. Let us bemore and more decided and earnest, making some one or other of theseblessednesses and Christian graces the main subject of our thoughts,even for weeks together. Let us not rest in general and confuseddesires after them, whereby we grasp at all, but catch nothing.
Mat 8:2-4	<br>In these verses we have an account of Christ's cleansing a leper, whocame and worshipped him, as one clothed with Divine power. Thiscleansing directs us, not only to apply to Christ, who has power overbodily diseases, for the cure of them, but it also teaches us in whatmanner to apply to him. When we cannot be sure of God's will, we may besure of his wisdom and mercy. No guilt is so great, but there is thatin Christ's blood which atones for it; no corruption so strong, butthere is that in his grace which can subdue it. To be made clean wemust commend ourselves to his pity; we cannot demand it as a debt, butwe must humbly request it as a favour. Those who by faith apply toChrist for mercy and grace, may be sure that he is freely willing togive them the mercy and grace they thus seek. And those afflictions areblessed that bring us to know Christ, and cause us to seek help andsalvation from him. Let those who are cleansed from their spiritualleprosy, go to Christ's ministers and open their case, that they mayadvise, comfort, and pray for them.
Mat 8:5-13	<br>This centurion was a heathen, a Roman soldier. Though he was a soldier,yet he was a godly man. No man's calling or place will be an excuse forunbelief and sin. See how he states his servant's case. We shouldconcern ourselves for the souls of our children and servants, who arespiritually sick, who feel not spiritual evils, who know not that whichis spiritually good; and we should bring them to Christ by faith andprayers. Observe his self-abasement. Humble souls are made more humbleby Christ's gracious dealings with them. Observe his great faith. Themore diffident we are of ourselves, the stronger will be our confidencein Christ. Herein the centurion owns him to have Divine power, and afull command of all the creatures and powers of nature, as a masterover his servants. Such servants we all should be to God; we must goand come, according to the directions of his word and the disposals ofhis providence. But when the Son of man comes he finds little faith,therefore he finds little fruit. An outward profession may cause us tobe called children of the kingdom; but if we rest in that, and havenothing else to show, we shall be cast out. The servant got a cure ofhis disease, and the master got the approval of his faith. What wassaid to him, is said to all, Believe, and ye shall receive; onlybelieve. See the power of Christ, and the power of faith. The healingof our souls is at once the effect and evidence of our interest in theblood of Christ.
Mat 8:14-17	<br>Peter had a wife, yet was an apostle of Christ, who showed that heapproved of the married state, by being thus kind to Peter's wife'srelations. The church of Rome, which forbids ministers to marry, goescontrary to that apostle upon whom they rest so much. He had his wife'smother with him in his family, which is an example to be kind to ourrelations. In spiritual healing, the Scripture speaks the word, theSpirit gives the touch, touches the heart, touches the hand. Those whorecover from fevers, commonly are weak and feeble some time after; butto show that this cure was above the power of nature, the woman was atonce so well as to go about the business of the house. The miracleswhich Jesus did being noised abroad, many thronged to him. He healedall that were sick, though the patient was ever so mean, and the caseever so bad. Many are the diseases and calamities to which we areliable in the body; and there is more, in those words of the gospel,that Jesus Christ bore our sicknesses and carried our sorrows, tosupport and comfort us under them, than in all the writings of thephilosophers. Let us not grudge labour, trouble, or expense in doinggood to others.
Mat 8:18-22	<br>One of the scribes was too hasty in promising; he proffers himself tobe a close follower of Christ. He seems to be very resolute. Manyresolutions for religion are produced by sudden conviction, and takenup without due consideration; these come to nothing. When this scribeoffered to follow Christ, one would think he should have beenencouraged; one scribe might do more credit and service than twelvefishermen; but Christ saw his heart, and answered to its thoughts, andtherein teaches all how to come to Christ. His resolve seems to havebeen from a worldly, covetous principle; but Christ had not a place tolay his head on, and if he follows him, he must not expect to farebetter than he fared. We have reason to think this scribe went away.Another was too slow. Delay in doing is as bad on the one hand, ashastiness in resolving is on the other. He asked leave to attend hisfather to his grave, and then he would be at Christ's service. Thisseemed reasonable, yet it was not right. He had not true zeal for thework. Burying the dead, especially a dead father, is a good work, butit is not thy work at this time. If Christ requires our service,affection even for the nearest and dearest relatives, and for thingsotherwise our duty, must give way. An unwilling mind never wants anexcuse. Jesus said to him, Follow me; and, no doubt, power went withthis word to him as to others; he did follow Christ, and cleaved tohim. The scribe said, I will follow thee; to this man Christ said,Follow me; comparing them together, it shows that we are brought toChrist by the force of his call to us, Ro 9:16.
Mat 8:23-27	<br>It is a comfort to those who go down to the sea in ships, and are oftenin perils there, to reflect that they have a Saviour to trust in andpray to, who knows what it is to be on the water, and to be in stormsthere. Those who are passing with Christ over the ocean of this world,must expect storms. His human nature, like to ours in every thing butsin, was wearied, and he slept at this time to try the faith of hisdisciples. They, in their fear, came to their Master. Thus is it in asoul; when lusts and temptations are swelling and raging, and God is,as it were, asleep to it, this brings it to the brink of despair. Thenit cries for a word from his mouth, Lord Jesus, keep not silence to me,or I am undone. Many that have true faith, are weak in it. Christ'sdisciples are apt to be disquieted with fears in a stormy day; totorment themselves that things are bad with them, and with dismalthoughts that they will be worse. Great storms of doubt and fear in thesoul, under the power of the spirit of bondage, sometimes end in awonderful calm, created and spoken by the Spirit of adoption. They wereastonished. They never saw a storm so turned at once into a perfectcalm. He that can do this, can do any thing, which encouragesconfidence and comfort in him, in the most stormy day, within orwithout, Isa 26:4.
Mat 8:28-34	<br>The devils have nothing to do with Christ as a Saviour; they neitherhave, nor hope for any benefit from him. Oh the depth of this mysteryof Divine love; that fallen man has so much to do with Christ, whenfallen angels have nothing to do with him! Heb 2:16. Surely here wastorment, to be forced to own the excellence that is in Christ, and yetthey had no part in him. The devils desire not to have any thing to dowith Christ as a Ruler. See whose language those speak, who will havenothing to do with the gospel of Christ. But it is not true that thedevils have nothing to do with Christ as a Judge; for they have, andthey know it, and thus it is with all the children of men. Satan andhis instruments can go no further than he permits; they must quitpossession when he commands. They cannot break his hedge of protectionabout his people; they cannot enter even a swine without his leave.They had leave. God often, for wise and holy ends, permits the effortsof Satan's rage. Thus the devil hurries people to sin; hurries them towhat they have resolved against, which they know will be shame andgrief to them: miserable is the condition of those who are led captiveby him at his will. There are a great many who prefer their swinebefore the Saviour, and so come short of Christ and salvation by him.They desire Christ to depart out of their hearts, and will not sufferhis word to have place in them, because he and his word would destroytheir brutish lusts, those swine which they give themselves up to feed.And justly will Christ forsake all that are weary of him; and sayhereafter, Depart, ye cursed, to those who now say to the Almighty,Depart from us.
Mat 9:1-8	<br>The faith of the friends of the paralytic in bringing him to Christ,was a strong faith; they firmly believed that Jesus Christ both couldand would heal him. A strong faith regards no obstacles in pressingafter Christ. It was a humble faith; they brought him to attend onChrist. It was an active faith. Sin may be pardoned, yet the sicknessnot be removed; the sickness may be removed, yet the sin not pardoned:but if we have the comfort of peace with God, with the comfort ofrecovery from sickness, this makes the healing a mercy indeed. This isno encouragement to sin. If thou bring thy sins to Jesus Christ, as thymalady and misery to be cured of, and delivered from, it is well; butto come with them, as thy darlings and delight, thinking still toretain them and receive him, is a gross mistake, a miserable delusion.The great intention of the blessed Jesus in the redemption he wrought,is to separate our hearts from sin. Our Lord Jesus has perfectknowledge of all that we say within ourselves. There is a great deal ofevil in sinful thoughts, which is very offensive to the Lord Jesus.Christ designed to show that his great errand to the world was, to savehis people from their sins. He turned from disputing with the scribes,and spake healing to the sick man. Not only he had no more need to becarried upon his bed, but he had strength to carry it. God must beglorified in all the power that is given to do good.<br>Verse 9<br>Matthew was in his calling, as the rest of those whom Christ called. AsSatan comes with his temptations to the idle, so Christ comes with hiscalls to those who are employed. We are all naturally averse from thee,O God; do thou bid us to follow thee; draw us by thy powerful word, andwe shall run after thee. Speak by the word of the Spirit to our hearts,the world cannot hold us down, Satan cannot stop our way, we shallarise and follow thee. A saving change is wrought in the soul, byChrist as the author, and his word as the means. Neither Matthew'splace, nor his gains by it, could detain him, when Christ called him.He left it, and though we find the disciples, who were fishers,occasionally fishing again afterwards, we never more find Matthew athis sinful gain.
Mat 9:10-13	<br>Some time after his call, Matthew sought to bring his old associates tohear Christ. He knew by experience what the grace of Christ could do,and would not despair concerning them. Those who are effectuallybrought to Christ, cannot but desire that others also may be brought tohim. Those who suppose their souls to be without disease will notwelcome the spiritual Physician. This was the case with the Pharisees;they despised Christ, because they thought themselves whole; but thepoor publicans and sinners felt that they wanted instruction andamendment. It is easy, and too common, to put the worst constructionsupon the best words and actions. It may justly be suspected that thosehave not the grace of God themselves, who are not pleased with others'obtaining it. Christ's conversing with sinners is here called mercy;for to promote the conversion of souls is the greatest act of mercy.The gospel call is a call to repentance; a call to us to change ourminds, and to change our ways. If the children of men had not beensinners, there had been no need for Christ to come among them. Let usexamine whether we have found out our sickness, and have learned tofollow the directions of our great Physician.
Mat 9:14-17	<br>John was at this time in prison; his circumstances, his character, andthe nature of the message he was sent to deliver, led those who werepeculiarly attached to him, to keep frequent fasts. Christ referredthem to John's testimony of him, Joh 3:29. Though there is no doubtthat Jesus and his disciples lived in a spare and frugal manner, itwould be improper for his disciples to fast while they had the comfortof his presence. When he is with them, all is well. The presence of thesun makes day, and its absence produces night. Our Lord furtherreminded them of common rules of prudence. It was not usual to take apiece of rough woolen cloth, which had never been prepared, to join toan old garment, for it would not join well with the soft, old garment,but would tear it further, and the rent would be made worse. Nor wouldmen put new wine into old leathern bottles, which were going to decay,and would be liable to burst from the fermenting of the wine; butputting the new wine into strong, new, skin bottles, both would bepreserved. Great caution and prudence are necessary, that youngconverts may not receive gloomy and forbidding ideas of the service ofour Lord; but duties are to be urged as they are able to bear them.
Mat 9:18-26	<br>The death of our relations should drive us to Christ, who is our life.And it is high honour to the greatest rulers to attend on the LordJesus; and those who would receive mercy from Christ, must honour him.The variety of methods Christ took in working his miracles, perhaps wasbecause of the different frames and tempers of mind, which those werein who came to him, and which He who searches the heart perfectly knew.A poor woman applied herself to Christ, and received mercy from him bythe way. If we do but touch, as it were, the hem of Christ's garment byliving faith, our worst evils will be healed; there is no other realcure, nor need we fear his knowing things which are a grief and burdento us, but which we would not tell to any earthly friend. When Christentered the ruler's house, he said, Give place. Sometimes, when thesorrow of the world prevails, it is difficult for Christ and hiscomforts to enter. The ruler's daughter was really dead, but not so toChrist. The death of the righteous is in a special manner to be lookedon as only a sleep. The words and works of Christ may not at first beunderstood, yet they are not therefore to be despised. The people wereput forth. Scorners who laugh at what they do not understand, are notproper witnesses of the wonderful works of Christ. Dead souls are notraised to spiritual life, unless Christ take them by the hand: it isdone in the day of his power. If this single instance of Christ'sraising one newly dead so increased his fame, what will be his glorywhen all that are in their graves shall hear his voice, and come forth;those that have done good to the resurrection of life, and those thathave done evil to the resurrection of damnation!
Mat 9:27-31	<br>At this time the Jews expected Messiah would appear; these blind menknew and proclaimed in the streets of Capernaum that he was come, andthat Jesus was he. Those who, by the providence of God, have lost theirbodily sight, may, by the grace of God, have the eyes of theirunderstanding fully enlightened. And whatever our wants and burdensare, we need no more for supply and support, than to share in the mercyof our Lord Jesus. In Christ is enough for all. They followed himcrying aloud. He would try their faith, and would teach us always topray, and not to faint, though the answer does not come at once. Theyfollowed Christ, and followed him crying; but the great question is, Doye believe? Nature may make us earnest, but it is only grace that canwork faith. Christ touched their eyes. He gives sight to blind souls bythe power of his grace going with his word, and he puts the cure upontheir faith. Those who apply to Jesus Christ, shall be dealt with, notaccording to their fancies, nor according to their profession, butaccording to their faith. Christ sometimes concealed his miracles,because he would not indulge the conceit which prevailed among theJews, that their Messiah should be a temporal prince, and so giveoccasion to the people to attempt tumults and seditions.
Mat 9:32-34	<br>Of the two, better a dumb devil than a blaspheming one. Christ's curesstrike at the root, and remove the effect by taking away the cause;they open the lips, by breaking Satan's power in the soul. Nothing canconvince those who are under the power of pride. They will believeanything, however false or absurd, rather than the Holy Scriptures;thus they show the enmity of their hearts against a holy God.
Mat 9:35-38	<br>Jesus visited not only the great and wealthy cities, but the poor,obscure villages; and there he preached, there he healed. The souls ofthe meanest in the world are as precious to Christ, and should be so tous, as the souls of those who make the greatest figure. There werepriests, Levites, and scribes, all over the land; but they were idolshepherds, Zec 11:17; therefore Christ had compassion on the people assheep scattered, as men perishing for lack of knowledge. To this dayvast multitudes are as sheep not having a shepherd, and we should havecompassion and do all we can to help them. The multitudes desirous ofspiritual instruction formed a plenteous harvest, needing many activelabourers; but few deserved that character. Christ is the Lord of theharvest. Let us pray that many may be raised up and sent forth, whowill labour in bringing souls to Christ. It is a sign that God is aboutto bestow some special mercy upon a people, when he stirs them up topray for it. And commissions given to labourers in answer to prayer,are most likely to be successful.
Mat 10:1-4	<br>The word "apostle" signifies messenger; they were Christ's messengers,sent forth to proclaim his kingdom. Christ gave them power to heal allmanner of sickness. In the grace of the gospel there is a slave forevery sore, a remedy for every malady. There is no spiritual disease,but there is power in Christ for the cure of it. There names arerecorded, and it is their honour; yet they had more reason to rejoicethat their names were written in heaven, while the high and mightynames of the great ones of the earth are buried in the dust.
Mat 10:5-15	<br>The Gentiles must not have the gospel brought them, till the Jews haverefused it. This restraint on the apostles was only in their firstmission. Wherever they went they must proclaim, The kingdom of heavenis at hand. They preached, to establish the faith; the kingdom, toanimate the hope; of heaven, to inspire the love of heavenly things,and the contempt of earthly; which is at hand, that men may prepare forit without delay. Christ gave power to work miracles for the confirmingof their doctrine. This is not necessary now that the kingdom of God iscome. It showed that the intent of the doctrine they preached, was toheal sick souls, and to raise those that were dead in sin. Inproclaiming the gospel of free grace for the healing and saving ofmen's souls, we must above all avoid the appearance of the spirit of anhireling. They are directed what to do in strange towns and cities. Theservant of Christ is the ambassador of peace to whatever place he issent. His message is even to the vilest sinners, yet it behoves him tofind out the best persons in every place. It becomes us to prayheartily for all, and to conduct ourselves courteously to all. They aredirected how to act as to those that refused them. The whole counsel ofGod must be declared, and those who will not attend to the graciousmessage, must be shown that their state is dangerous. This should beseriously laid to heart by all that hear the gospel, lest theirprivileges only serve to increase their condemnation.
Mat 10:16-42	<br>Our Lord warned his disciples to prepare for persecution. They were toavoid all things which gave advantage to their enemies, all meddlingwith worldly or political concerns, all appearance of evil orselfishness, and all underhand measures. Christ foretold troubles, notonly that the troubles might not be a surprise, but that they mightconfirm their faith. He tells them what they should suffer, and fromwhom. Thus Christ has dealt fairly and faithfully with us, in tellingus the worst we can meet with in his service; and he would have us dealso with ourselves, in sitting down and counting the cost. Persecutorsare worse than beasts, in that they prey upon those of their own kind.The strongest bonds of love and duty, have often been broken throughfrom enmity against Christ. Sufferings from friends and relations arevery grievous; nothing cuts more. It appears plainly, that all who willlive godly in Christ Jesus must suffer persecution; and we must expectto enter into the kingdom of God through many tribulations. With thesepredictions of trouble, are counsels and comforts for a time of trial.The disciples of Christ are hated and persecuted as serpents, and theirruin is sought, and they need the serpent's wisdom. Be ye harmless asdoves. Not only, do nobody any hurt, but bear nobody any ill-will.Prudent care there must be, but not an anxious, perplexing thought; letthis care be cast upon God. The disciples of Christ must think more howto do well, than how to speak well. In case of great peril, thedisciples of Christ may go out of the way of danger, though they mustnot go out of the way of duty. No sinful, unlawful means may be used toescape; for then it is not a door of God's opening. The fear of manbrings a snare, a perplexing snare, that disturbs our peace; anentangling snare, by which we are drawn into sin; and, therefore, itmust be striven and prayed against. Tribulation, distress, andpersecution cannot take away God's love to them, or theirs to him. FearHim, who is able to destroy both soul and body in hell. They mustdeliver their message publicly, for all are deeply concerned in thedoctrine of the gospel. The whole counsel of God must be made known, Ac20:27. Christ shows them why they should be of good cheer. Theirsufferings witnessed against those who oppose his gospel. When Godcalls us to speak for him, we may depend on him to teach us what tosay. A believing prospect of the end of our troubles, will be of greatuse to support us under them. They may be borne to the end, because thesufferers shall be borne up under them. The strength shall be accordingto the day. And it is great encouragement to those who are doingChrist's work, that it is a work which shall certainly be done. See howthe care of Providence extends to all creatures, even to the sparrows.This should silence all the fears of God's people; Ye are of more valuethan many sparrows. And the very hairs of your head are all numbered.This denotes the account God takes and keeps of his people. It is ourduty, not only to believe in Christ, but to profess that faith, insuffering for him, when we are called to it, as well as in serving him.That denial of Christ only is here meant which is persisted in, andthat confession only can have the blessed recompence here promised,which is the real and constant language of faith and love. Religion isworth every thing; all who believe the truth of it, will come up to theprice, and make every thing else yield to it. Christ will lead usthrough sufferings, to glory with him. Those are best prepared for thelife to come, that sit most loose to this present life. Though thekindness done to Christ's disciples be ever so small, yet if there beoccasion for it, and ability to do no more, it shall be accepted.Christ does not say that they deserve a reward; for we cannot merit anything from the hand of God; but they shall receive a reward from thefree gift of God. Let us boldly confess Christ, and show love to him inall things.
Mat 11:2-6	<br>Some think that John sent this inquiry for his own satisfaction. Wherethere is true faith, yet there may be a mixture of unbelief. Theremaining unbelief of good men may sometimes, in an hour of temptation;call in question the most important truths. But we hope that John'sfaith did not fail in this matter, and that he only desired to have itstrengthened and confirmed. Others think that John sent his disciplesto Christ for their satisfaction. Christ points them to what they heardand saw. Christ's gracious condescensions and compassions to the poor,show that it was he that should bring to the world the tender merciesof our God. Those things which men see and hear, if compared with theScriptures, direct in what way salvation is to be found. It isdifficult to conquer prejudices, and dangerous not to conquer them; butthose who believe in Christ, their faith will be found so much the moreto praise, and honour, and glory.
Mat 11:7-15	<br>What Christ said concerning John, was not only for his praise, but forthe people's profit. Those who attend on the word will be called togive an account of their improvements. Do we think when the sermon isdone, the care is over? No, then the greatest of the care begins. Johnwas a self-denying man, dead to all the pomps of the world and thepleasures of sense. It becomes people, in all their appearances, to beconsistent with their character and their situation. John was a greatand good man, yet not perfect; therefore he came short of glorifiedsaints. The least in heaven knows more, loves more, and does more inpraising God, and receives more from him, than the greatest in thisworld. But by the kingdom of heaven here, is rather to be understoodthe kingdom of grace, the gospel dispensation in its power and purity.What reason we have to be thankful that our lot is cast in the days ofthe kingdom of heaven, under such advantages of light and love!Multitudes were wrought upon by the ministry of John, and became hisdisciples. And those strove for a place in this kingdom, that one wouldthink had no right nor title to it, and so seemed to be intruders. Itshows us what fervency and zeal are required of all. Self must bedenied; the bent, the frame and temper of the mind must be altered.Those who will have an interest in the great salvation, will have itupon any terms, and not think them hard, nor quit their hold without ablessing. The things of God are of great and common concern. Godrequires no more from us than the right use of the faculties he hasgiven us. People are ignorant, because they will not learn.
Mat 11:16-24	<br>Christ reflects on the scribes and Pharisees, who had a proud conceitof themselves. He likens their behaviour to children's play, who beingout of temper without reason, quarrel with all the attempts of theirfellows to please them, or to get them to join in the plays for whichthey used to assemble. The cavils of worldly men are often verytrifling and show great malice. Something they have to urge againstevery one, however excellent and holy. Christ, who was undefiled, andseparate from sinners, is here represented as in league with them, andpolluted by them. The most unspotted innocence will not always be adefence against reproach. Christ knew that the hearts of the Jews weremore bitter and hardened against his miracles and doctrines, than thoseof Tyre and Sidon would have been; therefore their condemnation wouldbe the greater. The Lord exercises his almighty power, yet he punishesnone more than they deserve, and never withholds the knowledge of thetruth from those who long after it.
Mat 11:25-30	<br>It becomes children to be grateful. When we come to God as a Father, wemust remember that he is Lord of heaven and earth, which obliges us tocome to him with reverence as to the sovereign Lord of all; yet withconfidence, as one able to defend us from evil, and to supply us withall good. Our blessed Lord added a remarkable declaration, that theFather had delivered into his hands all power, authority, and judgment.We are indebted to Christ for all the revelation we have of God theFather's will and love, ever since Adam sinned. Our Saviour has invitedall that labour and are heavy-laden, to come unto him. In some sensesall men are so. Worldly men burden themselves with fruitless cares forwealth and honours; the gay and the sensual labour in pursuit ofpleasures; the slave of Satan and his own lusts, is the merest drudgeon earth. Those who labour to establish their own righteousness alsolabour in vain. The convinced sinner is heavy-laden with guilt andterror; and the tempted and afflicted believer has labours and burdens.Christ invites all to come to him for rest to their souls. He alonegives this invitation; men come to him, when, feeling their guilt andmisery, and believing his love and power to help, they seek him infervent prayer. Thus it is the duty and interest of weary andheavy-laden sinners, to come to Jesus Christ. This is the gospel call;Whoever will, let him come. All who thus come will receive rest asChrist's gift, and obtain peace and comfort in their hearts. But incoming to him they must take his yoke, and submit to his authority.They must learn of him all things, as to their comfort and obedience.He accepts the willing servant, however imperfect the services. Here wemay find rest for our souls, and here only. Nor need we fear his yoke.His commandments are holy, just, and good. It requires self-denial, andexposes to difficulties, but this is abundantly repaid, even in thisworld, by inward peace and joy. It is a yoke that is lined with love.So powerful are the assistances he gives us, so suitable theencouragements, and so strong the consolations to be found in the wayof duty, that we may truly say, it is a yoke of pleasantness. The wayof duty is the way of rest. The truths Christ teaches are such as wemay venture our souls upon. Such is the Redeemer's mercy; and whyshould the labouring and burdened sinner seek for rest from any otherquarter? Let us come to him daily, for deliverance from wrath andguilt, from sin and Satan, from all our cares, fears, and sorrows. Butforced obedience, far from being easy and light, is a heavy burden. Invain do we draw near to Jesus with our lips, while the heart is farfrom him. Then come to Jesus to find rest for your souls.
Mat 12:1-8	<br>Being in the corn-fields, the disciples began to pluck the ears ofcorn: the law of God allowed it, De 23:25. This was slender provisionfor Christ and his disciples; but they were content with it. ThePharisees did not quarrel with them for taking another man's corn, butfor doing it on the sabbath day. Christ came to free his followers, notonly from the corruptions of the Pharisees, but from their unscripturalrules, and justified what they did. The greatest shall not have theirlusts indulged, but the meanest shall have their wants considered.Those labours are lawful on the sabbath day which are necessary, andsabbath rest is to froward, not to hinder sabbath worship. Needfulprovision for health and food is to be made; but when servants are keptat home, and families become a scene of hurry and confusion on theLord's day, to furnish a feast for visitors, or for indulgence, thecase is very different. Such things as these, and many others commonamong professors, are to be blamed. The resting on the sabbath wasordained for man's good, De 5:14. No law must be understood so as tocontradict its own end. And as Christ is the Lord of the sabbath, it isfit the day and the work of it should be dedicated to him.
Mat 12:9-13	<br>Christ shows that works of mercy are lawful and proper to be done onthe Lord's day. There are more ways of doing well upon sabbath days,than by the duties of worship: attending the sick, relieving the poor,helping those who need speedy relief, teaching the young to care fortheir souls; these are doing good: and these must be done from love andcharity, with humility and self-denial, and shall be accepted, Ge 4:7.This, like other cures which Christ wrought, had a spiritual meaning.By nature our hands are withered, and we are unable of ourselves to doany thing that is good. Christ only, by the power of his grace, curesus; he heals the withered hand by putting life into the dead soul,works in us both to will and to do: for, with the command, there is apromise of grace given by the word.
Mat 12:14-21	<br>The Pharisees took counsel to find some accusation, that Jesus might becondemned to death. Aware of their design, as his time was not come, heretired from that place. Face does not more exactly answer to face inwater, than the character of Christ drawn by the prophet, to his temperand conduct as described by the evangelists. Let us with cheerfulconfidence commit our souls to so kind and faithful a Friend. Far frombreaking, he will strengthen the bruised reed; far from quenching thesmoking flax, or wick nearly out, he will rather blow it up into aflame. Let us lay aside contentious and angry debates; let us receiveone another as Christ receives us. And while encouraged by the graciouskindness of our Lord, we should pray that his Spirit may rest upon us,and make us able to copy his example.
Mat 12:22-30	<br>A soul under Satan's power, and led captive by him, is blind in thethings of God, and dumb at the throne of grace; sees nothing, and saysnothing to the purpose. Satan blinds the eyes by unbelief, and seals upthe lips from prayer. The more people magnified Christ, the moredesirous the Pharisees were to vilify him. It was evident that if Satanaided Jesus in casting out devils, the kingdom of hell was dividedagainst itself; how then could it stand! And if they said that Jesuscast out devils by the prince of the devils, they could not prove thattheir children cast them out by any other power. There are two greatinterests in the world; and when unclean spirits are cast out by theHoly Spirit, in the conversion of sinners to a life of faith andobedience, the kingdom of God is come unto us. All who do not aid orrejoice in such a change are against Christ.
Mat 12:31,32	<br>Here is a gracious assurance of the pardon of all sin upon gospelterms. Christ herein has set an example to the sons of men, to be readyto forgive words spoken against them. But humble and conscientiousbelievers, at times are tempted to think they have committed theunpardonable sin, while those who have come the nearest to it, seldomhave any fear about it. We may be sure that those who indeed repent andbelieve the gospel, have not committed this sin, or any other of thesame kind; for repentance and faith are the special gifts of God, whichhe would not bestow on any man, if he were determined never to pardonhim; and those who fear they have committed this sin, give a good signthat they have not. The trembling, contrite sinner, has the witness inhimself that this is not his case.
Mat 12:33-37	<br>Men's language discovers what country they are of, likewise what mannerof spirit they are of. The heart is the fountain, words are thestreams. A troubled fountain, and a corrupt spring, must send forthmuddy and unpleasant streams. Nothing but the salt of grace, cast intothe spring, will heal the waters, season the speech, and purify thecorrupt communication. An evil man has an evil treasure in his heart,and out of it brings forth evil things. Lusts and corruptions, dwellingand reigning in the heart, are an evil treasure, out of which thesinner brings forth bad words and actions, to dishonour God, and hurtothers. Let us keep constant watch over ourselves, that we may speakwords agreeable to the Christian character.
Mat 12:38-45	<br>Though Christ is always ready to hear and answer holy desires andprayers, yet those who ask amiss, ask and have not. Signs were grantedto those who desired them to confirm their faith, as Abraham andGideon; but denied to those who demanded them to excuse their unbelief.The resurrection of Christ from the dead by his own power, called herethe sign of the prophet Jonah, was the great proof of Christ's beingthe Messiah. As Jonah was three days and three nights in the whale, andthen came out again alive, thus Christ would be so long in the grave,and then rise again. The Ninevites would shame the Jews for notrepenting; the queen of Sheba, for not believing in Christ. And we haveno such cares to hinder us, we come not to Christ upon suchuncertainties. This parable represents the case of the Jewish churchand nation. It is also applicable to all those who hear the word ofGod, and are in part reformed, but not truly converted. The uncleanspirit leaves for a time, but when he returns, he finds Christ is notthere to shut him out; the heart is swept by outward reformation, butgarnished by preparation to comply with evil suggestions, and the manbecomes a more decided enemy of the truth. Every heart is the residenceof unclean spirits, except those which are temples of the Holy Ghost,by faith in Christ.
Mat 12:46-50	<br>Christ's preaching was plain, easy, and familiar, and suited to hishearers. His mother and brethren stood without, desiring to speak withhim, when they should have been standing within, desiring to hear him.Frequently, those who are nearest to the means of knowledge and graceare most negligent. We are apt to neglect that which we think we mayhave any day, forgetting that to-morrow is not ours. We often meet withhinderances in our work from friends about us, and are taken off bycare for the things of this life, from the concerns of our souls.Christ was so intent on his work, that no natural or other duty tookhim from it. Not that, under pretence of religion, we may bedisrespectful to parents, or unkind to relations; but the lesser dutymust stand by, while the greater is done. Let us cease from men, andcleave to Christ; let us look upon every Christian, in whatevercondition of life, as the brother, sister, or mother of the Lord ofglory; let us love, respect, and be kind to them, for his sake, andafter his example.
Mat 13:1-23	<br>Jesus entered into a boat that he might be the less pressed, and be thebetter heard by the people. By this he teaches us in the outwardcircumstances of worship not to covet that which is stately, but tomake the best of the conveniences God in his providence allots to us.Christ taught in parables. Thereby the things of God were made moreplain and easy to those willing to be taught, and at the same time moredifficult and obscure to those who were willingly ignorant. The parableof the sower is plain. The seed sown is the word of God. The sower isour Lord Jesus Christ, by himself, or by his ministers. Preaching to amultitude is sowing the corn; we know not where it will light. Somesort of ground, though we take ever so much pains with it, brings forthno fruit to purpose, while the good soil brings forth plentifully. Soit is with the hearts of men, whose different characters are heredescribed by four sorts of ground. Careless, trifling hearers, are aneasy prey to Satan; who, as he is the great murderer of souls, so he isthe great thief of sermons, and will be sure to rob us of the word, ifwe take not care to keep it. Hypocrites, like the stony ground, oftenget the start of true Christians in the shows of profession. Many areglad to hear a good sermon, who do not profit by it. They are told offree salvation, of the believer's privileges, and the happiness ofheaven; and, without any change of heart, without any abidingconviction of their own depravity, their need of a Saviour, or theexcellence of holiness, they soon profess an unwarranted assurance. Butwhen some heavy trial threatens them, or some sinful advantage may behad, they give up or disguise their profession, or turn to some easiersystem. Worldly cares are fitly compared to thorns, for they came inwith sin, and are a fruit of the curse; they are good in their place tostop a gap, but a man must be well armed that has much to do with them;they are entangling, vexing, scratching, and their end is to be burned,Heb 6:8. Worldly cares are great hinderances to our profiting by theword of God. The deceitfulness of riches does the mischief; they cannotbe said to deceive us unless we put our trust in them, then they chokethe good seed. What distinguished the good ground was fruitfulness. Bythis true Christians are distinguished from hypocrites. Christ does notsay that this good ground has no stones in it, or no thorns; but nonethat could hinder its fruitfulness. All are not alike; we should aim atthe highest, to bring forth most fruit. The sense of hearing cannot bebetter employed than in hearing God's word; and let us look toourselves that we may know what sort of hearers we are.
Mat 13:24-30	<br>, 36-43 This parable represents the present and future state of thegospel church; Christ's care of it, the devil's enmity against it, themixture there is in it of good and bad in this world, and theseparation between them in the other world. So prone is fallen man tosin, that if the enemy sow the tares, he may go his way, they willspring up, and do hurt; whereas, when good seed is sown, it must betended, watered, and fenced. The servants complained to their master;Sir, didst thou not sow good seed in thy field? No doubt he did;whatever is amiss in the church, we are sure it is not from Christ.Though gross transgressors, and such as openly oppose the gospel, oughtto be separated from the society of the faithful, yet no human skillcan make an exact separation. Those who oppose must not be cut off, butinstructed, and that with meekness. And though good and bad aretogether in this world, yet at the great day they shall be parted; thenthe righteous and the wicked shall be plainly known; here sometimes itis hard to distinguish between them. Let us, knowing the terrors of theLord, not do iniquity. At death, believers shall shine forth tothemselves; at the great day they shall shine forth before all theworld. They shall shine by reflection, with light borrowed from theFountain of light. Their sanctification will be made perfect, and theirjustification published. May we be found of that happy number.
Mat 13:31-35	<br>The scope of the parable of the seed sown, is to show that thebeginnings of the gospel would be small, but its latter end wouldgreatly increase; in this way the work of grace in the heart, thekingdom of God within us, would be carried on. In the soul where gracetruly is, it will grow really; though perhaps at first not to bediscerned, it will at last come to great strength and usefulness. Thepreaching of the gospel works like leaven in the hearts of those whoreceive it. The leaven works certainly, so does the word, yetgradually. It works silently, and without being seen, Mr 4:26-29, yetstrongly; without noise, for so is the way of the Spirit, but withoutfail. Thus it was in the world. The apostles, by preaching the gospel,hid a handful of leaven in the great mass of mankind. It was madepowerful by the Spirit of the Lord of hosts, who works, and none canhinder. Thus it is in the heart. When the gospel comes into the soul,it works a thorough change; it spreads itself into all the powers andfaculties of the soul, and alters the property even of the members ofthe body, Ro 6:13. From these parables we are taught to expect agradual progress; therefore let us inquire, Are we growing in grace?and in holy principles and habits?
Mat 13:44-52	<br>Here are four parables. 1. That of the treasure hid in the field. Manyslight the gospel, because they look only upon the surface of thefield. But all who search the Scriptures, so as in them to find Christand eternal life, Joh 5:39, will discover such treasure in this fieldas makes it unspeakably valuable; they make it their own upon anyterms. Though nothing can be given as a price for this salvation, yetmuch must be given up for the sake of it. 2. All the children of menare busy; one would be rich, another would be honourable, another wouldbe learned; but most are deceived, and take up with counterfeits forpearls. Jesus Christ is a Pearl of great price; in having him, we haveenough to make us happy here and for ever. A man may buy gold too dear,but not this Pearl of great price. When the convinced sinner seesChrist as the gracious Saviour, all things else become worthless to histhoughts. 3. The world is a vast sea, and men, in their natural state,are like the fishes. Preaching the gospel is casting a net into thissea, to catch something out of it, for His glory who has thesovereignty of this sea. Hypocrites and true Christians shall beparted: miserable is the condition of those that shall then be castaway. 4. A skilful, faithful minister of the gospel, is a scribe, wellversed in the things of the gospel, and able to teach them. Christcompares him to a good householder, who brings forth fruits of lastyear's growth and this year's gathering, abundance and variety, toentertain his friends. Old experiences and new observations, all havetheir use. Our place is at Christ's feet, and we must daily learn oldlessons over again, and new ones also.
Mat 13:53-58	<br>Christ repeats his offer to those who have repulsed them. They upbraidhim, Is not this the carpenter's son? Yes, it is true he was reputed tobe so; and no disgrace to be the son of an honest tradesman; theyshould have respected him the more because he was one of themselves,but therefore they despised him. He did not many mighty works there,because of their unbelief. Unbelief is the great hinderance to Christ'sfavours. Let us keep faithful to him as the Saviour who has made ourpeace with God.
Mat 14:1-12	<br>The terror and reproach of conscience, which Herod, like other daringoffenders, could not shake off, are proofs and warnings of a futurejudgment, and of future misery to them. But there may be the terror ofconvictions, where there is not the truth of conversion. When menpretend to favour the gospel, yet live in evil, we must not favourtheir self-delusion, but must deliver our consciences as John did. Theworld may call this rudeness and blind zeal. False professors, or timidChristians, may censure it as want of civility; but the most powerfulenemies can go no further than the Lord sees good to permit. Herodfeared that the putting of John to death might raise a rebellion amongthe people, which it did not; but he never feared it might stir up hisown conscience against him, which it did. Men fear being hanged forwhat they do not fear being damned for. And times of carnal mirth andjollity are convenient times for carrying on bad designs against God'speople. Herod would profusely reward a worthless dance, whileimprisonment and death were the recompence of the man of God who soughtthe salvation of his soul. But there was real malice to John beneathhis consent, or else Herod would have found ways to get clear of hispromise. When the under shepherds are smitten, the sheep need not bescattered while they have the Great Shepherd to go to. And it is betterto be drawn to Christ by want and loss, than not to come to him at all.
Mat 14:13-21	<br>When Christ and his word withdraw, it is best for us to follow, seekingthe means of grace for our souls before any worldly advantages. Thepresence of Christ and his gospel, makes a desert not only tolerable,but desirable. This little supply of bread was increased by Christ'screating power, till the whole multitude were satisfied. In seeking thewelfare of men's souls, we should have compassion on their bodieslikewise. Let us also remember always to crave a blessing on our meals,and learn to avoid all waste, as frugality is the proper source ofliberality. See in this miracle an emblem of the Bread of life, whichcame down from heaven to sustain our perishing souls. The provisions ofChrist's gospel appear mean and scanty to the world, yet they satisfyall that feed on him in their hearts by faith with thanksgiving.
Mat 14:22-33	<br>Those are not Christ's followers who cannot enjoy being alone with Godand their own hearts. It is good, upon special occasions, and when wefind our hearts enlarged, to continue long in secret prayer, and inpouring out our hearts before the Lord. It is no new thing for Christ'sdisciples to meet with storms in the way of duty, but he thereby showshimself with the more grace to them and for them. He can take what wayhe pleases to save his people. But even appearances of deliverancesometimes occasion trouble and perplexity to God's people, frommistakes about Christ. Nothing ought to affright those that have Christnear them, and know he is theirs; not death itself. Peter walked uponthe water, not for diversion or to boast of it, but to go to Jesus; andin that he was thus wonderfully borne up. Special supports arepromised, and are to be expected, but only in spiritual pursuits; norcan we ever come to Jesus, unless we are upheld by his power. Christbade Peter come, not only that he might walk upon the water, and soknow his Lord's power, but that he might know his own weakness. And theLord often lets his servants have their choice, to humble and provethem, and to show the greatness of his power and grace. When we lookoff from Christ, and look at the greatness of opposing difficulties, weshall begin to fall; but when we call to him, he will stretch out hisarm, and save us. Christ is the great Saviour; those who would besaved, must come to him, and cry to him, for salvation; we are neverbrought to this, till we find ourselves sinking: the sense of needdrives us to him. He rebuked Peter. Could we but believe more, weshould suffer less. The weakness of faith, and the prevailing of ourdoubts, displease our Lord Jesus, for there is no good reason whyChrist's disciples should be of a doubtful mind. Even in a stormy dayhe is to them a very present help. None but the world's Creator couldmultiply the loaves, none but its Governor could tread upon the watersof the sea: the disciples yield to the evidence, and confess theirfaith. They were suitably affected, and worshipped Christ. He thatcomes to God, must believe; and he that believes in God, will come, Heb11:6.
Mat 14:34-36	<br>Whithersoever Christ went, he was doing good. They brought unto him allthat were diseased. They came humbly beseeching him to help them. Theexperiences of others may direct and encourage us in seeking forChrist. As many as touched, were made perfectly whole. Those whomChrist heals, he heals perfectly. Were men more acquainted with Christ,and with the diseased state of their souls, they would flock to receivehis healing influences. The healing virtue was not in the finger, butin their faith; or rather, it was in Christ, whom their faith took holdupon.
Mat 15:1-9	<br>Additions to God's laws reflect upon his wisdom, as if he had left outsomething which was needed, and which man could supply; in one way orother they always lead men to disobey God. How thankful ought we to befor the written word of God! Never let us think that the religion ofthe Bible can be improved by any human addition, either in doctrine orpractice. Our blessed Lord spoke of their traditions as inventions oftheir own, and pointed out one instance in which this was very clear,that of their transgressing the fifth commandment. When a parent'swants called for assistance, they pleaded, that they had devoted to thetemple all they could spare, even though they did not part with it, andtherefore their parents must expect nothing from them. This was makingthe command of God of no effect. The doom of hypocrites is put in alittle compass; "In vain do they worship me." It will neither pleaseGod, nor profit themselves; they trust in vanity, and vanity will betheir recompence.
Mat 15:10-20	<br>Christ shows that the defilement they ought to fear, was not from whatentered their mouths as food, but from what came out of their mouths,which showed the wickedness of their hearts. Nothing will last in thesoul but the regenerating graces of the Holy Spirit; and nothing shouldbe admitted into the church but what is from above; therefore, whoeveris offended by a plain, seasonable declaration of the truth, we shouldnot be troubled at it. The disciples ask to be better taught as to thismatter. Where a weak head doubts concerning any word of Christ, anupright heart and a willing mind seek for instruction. It is the heartthat is desperately wicked, Jer 17:9, for there is no sin in word ordeed, which was not first in the heart. They all come out of the man,and are fruits of that wickedness which is in the heart, and is wroughtthere. When Christ teaches, he will show men the deceitfulness andwickedness of their own hearts; he will teach them to humblethemselves, and to seek to be cleansed in the Fountain opened for sinand uncleanness.
Mat 15:21-28	<br>The dark corners of the country, the most remote, shall share Christ'sinfluences; afterwards the ends of the earth shall see his salvation.The distress and trouble of her family brought a woman to Christ; andthough it is need that drives us to Christ, yet we shall not thereforebe driven from him. She did not limit Christ to any particular instanceof mercy, but mercy, mercy, is what she begged for: she pleads notmerit, but depends upon mercy. It is the duty of parents to pray fortheir children, and to be earnest in prayer for them, especially fortheir souls. Have you a son, a daughter, grievously vexed with a prouddevil, an unclean devil, a malicious devil, led captive by him at hiswill? this is a case more deplorable than that of bodily possession,and you must bring them by faith and prayer to Christ, who alone isable to heal them. Many methods of Christ's providence, especially ofhis grace, in dealing with his people, which are dark and perplexing,may be explained by this story, which teaches that there may be love inChrist's heart while there are frowns in his face; and it encouragesus, though he seems ready to slay us, yet to trust in him. Those whomChrist intends most to honour, he humbles to feel their ownunworthiness. A proud, unhumbled heart would not have borne this; butshe turned it into an argument to support her request. The state ofthis woman is an emblem of the state of a sinner, deeply conscious ofthe misery of his soul. The least of Christ is precious to a believer,even the very crumbs of the Bread of life. Of all graces, faith honoursChrist most; therefore of all graces Christ honours faith most. Hecured her daughter. He spake, and it was done. From hence let such asseek help from the Lord, and receive no gracious answer, learn to turneven their unworthiness and discouragements into pleas for mercy.
Mat 15:29-39	<br>Whatever our case is, the only way to find ease and relief, is to layit at Christ's feet, to submit it to him, and refer it to his disposal.Those who would have spiritual healing from Christ, must be ruled as hepleases. See what work sin has made; what various diseases human bodiesare subject to. Here were such diseases as fancy could neither guessthe cause nor the cure of, yet these were subject to the command ofChrist. The spiritual cures that Christ works are wonderful. When blindsouls are made to see by faith, the dumb to speak in prayer, the maimedand the lame to walk in holy obedience, it is to be wondered at. Hispower was also shown to the multitude, in the plentiful provision hemade for them: the manner is much the same as before. All did eat, andwere filled. Those whom Christ feeds, he fills. With Christ there isbread enough, and to spare; supplies of grace for more than seek it,and for those that seek for more. Christ sent away the people. Thoughhe had fed them twice, they must not look for miracles to find theirdaily bread. Let them go home to their callings and their own tables.Lord, increase our faith, and pardon our unbelief, teaching us to liveupon thy fulness and bounty, for all things pertaining to this life,and that which is to come.
Mat 16:1-4	<br>The Pharisees and Sadducees were opposed to each other in principlesand in conduct; yet they joined against Christ. But they desired a signof their own choosing: they despised those signs which relieved thenecessity of the sick and sorrowful, and called for something elsewhich would gratify the curiosity of the proud. It is great hypocrisy,when we slight the signs of God's ordaining, to seek for signs of ourown devising.
Mat 16:5-12	<br>Christ speaks of spiritual things under a similitude, and the disciplesmisunderstand him of carnal things. He took it ill that they shouldthink him as thoughtful about bread as they were; that they should beso little acquainted with his way of preaching. Then understood theywhat he meant. Christ teaches by the Spirit of wisdom in the heart,opening the understanding to the Spirit of revelation in the word.
Mat 16:13-20	<br>Peter, for himself and his brethren, said that they were assured of ourLord's being the promised Messiah, the Son of the living God. Thisshowed that they believed Jesus to be more than man. Our Lord declaredPeter to be blessed, as the teaching of God made him differ from hisunbelieving countrymen. Christ added that he had named him Peter, inallusion to his stability or firmness in professing the truth. The wordtranslated "rock," is not the same word as Peter, but is of a similarmeaning. Nothing can be more wrong than to suppose that Christ meantthe person of Peter was the rock. Without doubt Christ himself is theRock, the tried foundation of the church; and woe to him that attemptsto lay any other! Peter's confession is this rock as to doctrine. IfJesus be not the Christ, those that own him are not of the church, butdeceivers and deceived. Our Lord next declared the authority with whichPeter would be invested. He spoke in the name of his brethren, and thisrelated to them as well as to him. They had no certain knowledge of thecharacters of men, and were liable to mistakes and sins in their ownconduct; but they were kept from error in stating the way of acceptanceand salvation, the rule of obedience, the believer's character andexperience, and the final doom of unbelievers and hypocrites. In suchmatters their decision was right, and it was confirmed in heaven. Butall pretensions of any man, either to absolve or retain men's sins, areblasphemous and absurd. None can forgive sins but God only. And thisbinding and loosing, in the common language of the Jews, signified toforbid and to allow, or to teach what is lawful or unlawful.
Mat 16:21-23	<br>Christ reveals his mind to his people gradually. From that time, whenthe apostles had made the full confession of Christ, that he was theSon of God, he began to show them of his sufferings. He spake this toset right the mistakes of his disciples about the outward pomp andpower of his kingdom. Those that follow Christ, must not expect greator high things in this world. Peter would have Christ to dreadsuffering as much as he did; but we mistake, if we measure Christ'slove and patience by our own. We do not read of any thing said or doneby any of his disciples, at any time, that Christ resented so much asthis. Whoever takes us from that which is good, and would make us fearto do too much for God, speaks Satan's language. Whatever appears to bea temptation to sin, must be resisted with abhorrence, and not beparleyed with. Those that decline suffering for Christ, savour more ofthe things of man than of the things of God.
Mat 16:24-28	<br>A true disciple of Christ is one that does follow him in duty, andshall follow him to glory. He is one that walks in the same way Christwalked in, is led by his Spirit, and treads in his steps, whithersoeverhe goes. "Let him deny himself." If self-denial be a hard lesson, it isno more than what our Master learned and practised, to redeem us, andto teach us. "Let him take up his cross." The cross is here put forevery trouble that befalls us. We are apt to think we could bearanother's cross better than our own; but that is best which isappointed us, and we ought to make the best of it. We must not by ourrashness and folly pull crosses down upon our own heads, but must takethem up when they are in our way. If any man will have the name andcredit of a disciple, let him follow Christ in the work and duty of adisciple. If all worldly things are worthless when compared with thelife of the body, how forcible the same argument with respect to thesoul and its state of never-ending happiness or misery! Thousands losetheir souls for the most trifling gain, or the most worthlessindulgence, nay, often from mere sloth and negligence. Whatever is theobject for which men forsake Christ, that is the price at which Satanbuys their souls. Yet one soul is worth more than all the world. Thisis Christ's judgment upon the matter; he knew the price of souls, forhe redeemed them; nor would he underrate the world, for he made it. Thedying transgressor cannot purchase one hour's respite to seek mercy forhis perishing soul. Let us then learn rightly to value our souls, andChrist as the only Saviour of them.
Mat 17:1-13	<br>Now the disciples beheld somewhat of Christ's glory, as of the onlybegotten of the Father. It was intended to support their faith, whenthey would have to witness his crucifixion; and would give them an ideaof the glory prepared for them, when changed by his power and made likehim. The apostles were overcome by the glorious sight. Peter thoughtthat it was most desirable to continue there, and to go no more down tomeet the sufferings of which he was so unwilling to hear. In this heknew not what he said. We are wrong, if we look for a heaven here uponearth. Whatever tabernacles we propose to make for ourselves in thisworld, we must always remember to ask Christ's leave. That sacrificewas not yet offered, without which the souls of sinful men could nothave been saved; and important services were to be done by Peter andhis brethren. While Peter spoke, a bright cloud overshadowed them, anemblem of the Divine presence and glory. Ever since man sinned, andheard God's voice in the garden, unusual appearances of God have beenterrible to man. They fell prostrate to the earth, till Jesusencouraged them; when looking round, they beheld only their Lord asthey commonly saw him. We must pass through varied experiences in ourway to glory; and when we return to the world after an ordinance, itmust be our care to take Christ with us, and then it may be our comfortthat he is with us.
Mat 17:14-21	<br>The case of afflicted children should be presented to God by faithfuland fervent prayer. Christ cured the child. Though the people wereperverse, and Christ was provoked, yet care was taken of the child.When all other helps and succours fail, we are welcome to Christ, maytrust in him, and in his power and goodness. See here an emblem ofChrist's undertaking as our Redeemer. It encourages parents to bringchildren to Christ, whose souls are under Satan's power; he is able toheal them, and as willing as he is able. Not only bring them to Christby prayer, but bring them to the word of Christ; to means by whichSatan's strong-holds in the soul are beaten down. It is good for us todistrust ourselves and our own strength; but it is displeasing toChrist when we distrust any power derived from him, or granted by him.There was also something in the malady which rendered the curedifficult. The extraordinary power of Satan must not discourage ourfaith, but quicken us to more earnestness in praying to God for theincrease of it. Do we wonder to see Satan's bodily possession of thisyoung man from a child, when we see his spiritual possession of everyson of Adam from the fall!
Mat 17:22,23	<br>Christ perfectly knew all things that should befall him, yet undertookthe work of our redemption, which strongly shows his love. What outwarddebasement and Divine glory was the life of the Redeemer! And all hishumiliation ended in his exaltation. Let us learn to endure the cross,to despise riches and worldly honours, and to be content with his will.
Mat 17:24-27	<br>Peter felt sure that his Master was ready to do what was right. Christspoke first to give him proof that no thought can be withholden fromhim. We must never decline our duty for fear of giving offence; but wemust sometimes deny ourselves in our worldly interests, rather thangive offence. However the money was lodged in the fish, He who knowsall things alone could know it, and only almighty power could bring itto Peter's hook. The power and the poverty of Christ should bementioned together. If called by providence to be poor, like our Lord,let us trust in his power, and our God shall supply all our need,according to his riches in glory by Christ Jesus. In the way ofobedience, in the course, perhaps, of our usual calling, as he helpedPeter, so he will help us. And if any sudden call should occur, whichwe are not prepared to meet, let us not apply to others, till we firstseek Christ.
Mat 18:1-6	<br>Christ spoke many words of his sufferings, but only one of his glory;yet the disciples fasten upon that, and overlook the others. Many loveto hear and speak of privileges and glory, who are willing to pass bythe thoughts of work and trouble. Our Lord set a little child beforethem, solemnly assuring them, that unless they were converted and madelike little children, they could not enter his kingdom. Children, whenvery young, do not desire authority, do not regard outwarddistinctions, are free from malice, are teachable, and willinglydependent on their parents. It is true that they soon begin to showother dispositions, and other ideas are taught them at an early age;but these are marks of childhood, and render them proper emblems of thelowly minds of true Christians. Surely we need to be daily renewed inthe spirit of our minds, that we may become simple and humble, aslittle children, and willing to be the least of all. Let us daily studythis subject, and examine our own spirits.
Mat 18:7-14	<br>Considering the cunning and malice of Satan, and the weakness anddepravity of men's hearts, it is not possible but that there should beoffences. God permits them for wise and holy ends, that those who aresincere, and those who are not, may be made known. Being told before,that there will be seducers, tempters, persecutors, and bad examples,let us stand on our guard. We must, as far as lawfully we may, partwith what we cannot keep without being entangled by it in sin. Theoutward occasions of sin must be avoided. If we live after the flesh,we must die. If we, through the Spirit, mortify the deeds of the body,we shall live. Christ came into the world to save souls, and he willreckon severely with those who hinder the progress of others who aresetting their faces heavenward. And shall any of us refuse attention tothose whom the Son of God came to seek and to save? A father takes careof all his children, but is particularly tender of the little ones.
Mat 18:15-20	<br>If a professed Christian is wronged by another, he ought not tocomplain of it to others, as is often done merely upon report, but togo to the offender privately, state the matter kindly, and show him hisconduct. This would generally have all the desired effect with a trueChristian, and the parties would be reconciled. The principles of theserules may be practised every where, and under all circumstances, thoughthey are too much neglected by all. But how few try the method whichChrist has expressly enjoined to all his disciples! In all ourproceedings we should seek direction in prayer; we cannot too highlyprize the promises of God. Wherever and whenever we meet in the name ofChrist, we should consider him as present in the midst of us.
Mat 18:21-35	<br>Though we live wholly on mercy and forgiveness, we are backward toforgive the offences of our brethren. This parable shows how muchprovocation God has from his family on earth, and how untoward hisservants are. There are three things in the parable: 1. The master'swonderful clemency. The debt of sin is so great, that we are not ableto pay it. See here what every sin deserves; this is the wages of sin,to be sold as a slave. It is the folly of many who are under strongconvictions of their sins, to fancy they can make God satisfaction forthe wrong they have done him. 2. The servant's unreasonable severitytoward his fellow-servant, notwithstanding his lord's clemency towardhim. Not that we may make light of wronging our neighbour, for that isalso a sin against God; but we should not aggravate our neighbour'swronging us, nor study revenge. Let our complaints, both of thewickedness of the wicked, and of the afflictions of the afflicted, bebrought to God, and left with him. 3. The master reproved his servant'scruelty. The greatness of sin magnifies the riches of pardoning mercy;and the comfortable sense of pardoning mercy, does much to dispose ourhearts to forgive our brethren. We are not to suppose that God actuallyforgives men, and afterwards reckons their guilt to them to condemnthem; but this latter part of the parable shows the false conclusionsmany draw as to their sins being pardoned, though their after-conductshows that they never entered into the spirit, or experienced thesanctifying grace of the gospel. We do not forgive our offendingbrother aright, if we do not forgive from the heart. Yet this is notenough; we must seek the welfare even of those who offend us. Howjustly will those be condemned, who, though they bear the Christianname, persist in unmerciful treatment of their brethren! The humbledsinner relies only on free, abounding mercy, through the ransom of thedeath of Christ. Let us seek more and more for the renewing grace ofGod, to teach us to forgive others as we hope for forgiveness from him.
Mat 19:1,2	<br>Great multitudes followed Christ. When Christ departs, it is best forus to follow him. They found him as able and ready to help elsewhere,as he had been in Galilee; wherever the Sun of Righteousness arose, itwas with healing in his wings.
Mat 19:3-12	<br>The Pharisees were desirous of drawing something from Jesus which theymight represent as contrary to the law of Moses. Cases about marriagehave been numerous, and sometimes perplexed; made so, not by the law ofGod, but by the lusts and follies of men; and often people fix whatthey will do, before they ask for advice. Jesus replied by askingwhether they had not read the account of the creation, and the firstexample of marriage; thus pointing out that every departure therefromwas wrong. That condition is best for us, and to be chosen and kept toaccordingly, which is best for our souls, and tends most to prepare usfor, and preserve us to, the kingdom of heaven. When the gospel isreally embraced, it makes men kind relatives and faithful friends; itteaches them to bear the burdens, and to bear with the infirmities ofthose with whom they are connected, to consider their peace andhappiness more than their own. As to ungodly persons, it is proper thatthey should be restrained by laws, from breaking the peace of society.And we learn that the married state should be entered upon with greatseriousness and earnest prayer.
Mat 19:13-15	<br>It is well when we come to Christ ourselves, and bring our children.Little children may be brought to Christ as needing, and being capableof receiving blessings from him, and having an interest in hisintercession. We can but beg a blessing for them: Christ only cancommand the blessing. It is well for us, that Christ has more love andtenderness in him than the best of his disciples have. And let us learnof him not to discountenance any willing, well-meaning souls, in theirseeking after Christ, though they are but weak. Those who are given toChrist, as part of his purchase, he will in no wise cast out. Thereforehe takes it ill of all who forbid, and try to shut out those whom hehas received. And all Christians should bring their children to theSaviour that he may bless them with spiritual blessings.
Mat 19:16-22	<br>Christ knew that covetousness was the sin which most easily beset thisyoung man; though he had got honestly what he possessed, yet he couldnot cheerfully part with it, and by this his want of sincerity wasshown. Christ's promises make his precepts easy, and his yoke pleasantand very comfortable; yet this promise was as much a trial of the youngman's faith, as the precept was of his charity and contempt of theworld. It is required of us in following Christ, that we duly attendhis ordinances, strictly follow his pattern, and cheerfully submit tohis disposals; and this from love to him, and in dependence on him. Tosell all, and give to the poor, will not serve, but we are to followChrist. The gospel is the only remedy for lost sinners. Many abstainfrom gross vices who do not attend to their obligations to God.Thousands of instances of disobedience in thought, word, and deed, aremarked against them in the book of God. Thus numbers forsake Christ,loving this present world: they feel convictions and desires, but theydepart sorrowful, perhaps trembling. It behoves us to try ourselves inthese matters, for the Lord will try us.
Mat 19:23-30	<br>Though Christ spoke so strongly, few that have riches do not trust inthem. How few that are poor are not tempted to envy! But men'searnestness in this matter is like their toiling to build a high wallto shut themselves and their children out of heaven. It should besatisfaction to those who are in a low condition, that they are notexposed to the temptations of a high and prosperous condition. If theylive more hardly in this world than the rich, yet, if they get moreeasily to a better world, they have no reason to complain. Christ'swords show that it is hard for a rich man to be a good Christian, andto be saved. The way to heaven is a narrow way to all, and the gatethat leads into it, a strait gate; particularly so to rich people. Moreduties are expected from them than from others, and more sins easilybeset them. It is hard not to be charmed with a smiling world. Richpeople have a great account to make up for their opportunities aboveothers. It is utterly impossible for a man that sets his heart upon hisriches, to get to heaven. Christ used an expression, denoting adifficulty altogether unconquerable by the power of man. Nothing lessthan the almighty grace of God will enable a rich man to get over thisdifficulty. Who then can be saved? If riches hinder rich people, arenot pride and sinful lusts found in those not rich, and as dangerous tothem? Who can be saved? say the disciples. None, saith Christ, by anycreated power. The beginning, progress, and perfecting the work ofsalvation, depend wholly on the almighty power of God, to which allthings are possible. Not that rich people can be saved in theirworldliness, but that they should be saved from it. Peter said, We haveforsaken all. Alas! it was but a poor all, only a few boats and nets;yet observe how Peter speaks, as if it had been some mighty thing. Weare too apt to make the most of our services and sufferings, ourexpenses and losses, for Christ. However, Christ does not upbraid them;though it was but little that they had forsaken, yet it was their all,and as dear to them as if it had been more. Christ took it kindly thatthey left it to follow him; he accepts according to what a man hath.Our Lord's promise to the apostles is, that when the Son of man shallsit on the throne of his glory, he will make all things new, and theyshall sit with him in judgement on those who will be judged accordingto their doctrine. This sets forth the honour, dignity, and authorityof their office and ministry. Our Lord added, that every one who hadforsaken possessions or comforts, for his sake and the gospel, would berecompensed at last. May God give us faith to rest our hope on this hispromise; then we shall be ready for every service or sacrifice. OurSaviour, in the last verse, does away a mistake of some. The heavenlyinheritance is not given as earthly ones are, but according to God'spleasure. Let us not trust in promising appearances or outwardprofession. Others may, for aught we know, become eminent in faith andholiness.
Mat 20:1-16	<br>The direct object of this parable seems to be, to show that though theJews were first called into the vineyard, at length the gospel shouldbe preached to the Gentiles, and they should be admitted to equalprivileges and advantages with the Jews. The parable may also beapplied more generally, and shows, 1. That God is debtor to no man. 2.That many who begin last, and promise little in religion, sometimes, bythe blessing of God, arrive at a great deal of knowledge, grace, andusefulness. 3. That the recompense of reward will be given to thesaints, but not according to the time of their conversion. It describesthe state of the visible church, and explains the declaration that thelast shall be first, and the first last, in its various references.Till we are hired into the service of God, we are standing all the dayidle: a sinful state, though a state of drudgery to Satan, may becalled a state of idleness. The market-place is the world, and fromthat we are called by the gospel. Come, come from this market-place.Work for God will not admit of trifling. A man may go idle to hell, buthe that will go to heaven, must be diligent. The Roman penny wassevenpence halfpenny in our money, wages then enough for the day'ssupport. This does not prove that the reward of our obedience to God isof works, or of debt; when we have done all, we are unprofitableservants; but it signifies that there is a reward set before us, yetlet none, upon this presumption, put off repentance till they are old.Some were sent into the vineyard at the eleventh hour; but nobody hadhired them before. The Gentiles came in at the eleventh hour; thegospel had not been before preached to them. Those that have had gospeloffers made them at the third or sixth hour, and have refused them,will not have to say at the eleventh hour, as these had, No man hashired us. Therefore, not to discourage any, but to awaken all, be itremembered, that now is the accepted time. The riches of Divine graceare loudly murmured at, among proud Pharisees and nominal Christians.There is great proneness in us to think that we have too little, andothers too much of the tokens of God's favour; and that we do too much,and others too little in the work of God. But if God gives grace toothers, it is kindness to them, and no injustice to us. Carnalworldlings agree with God for their penny in this world; and choosetheir portion in this life. Obedient believers agree with God for theirpenny in the other world, and must remember they have so agreed. Didstnot thou agree to take up with heaven as thy portion, thy all; wiltthou seek for happiness in the creature? God punishes none more thanthey deserve, and recompenses every service done for him; he thereforedoes no wrong to any, by showing extraordinary grace to some. See herethe nature of envy. It is an evil eye, which is displeased at the goodof others, and desires their hurt. It is a grief to ourselves,displeasing to God, and hurtful to our neighbours: it is a sin that hasneither pleasure, profit, nor honour. Let us forego every proud claim,and seek for salvation as a free gift. Let us never envy or grudge, butrejoice and praise God for his mercy to others as well as to ourselves.
Mat 20:17-19	<br>Christ is more particular here in foretelling his sufferings thanbefore. And here, as before, he adds the mention of his resurrectionand his glory, to that of his death and sufferings, to encourage hisdisciples, and comfort them. A believing view of our once crucified andnow glorified Redeemer, is good to humble a proud, self-justifyingdisposition. When we consider the need of the humiliation andsufferings of the Son of God, in order to the salvation of perishingsinners, surely we must be aware of the freeness and richness of Divinegrace in our salvation.
Mat 20:20-28	<br>The sons of Zebedee abused what Christ said to comfort the disciples.Some cannot have comforts but they turn them to a wrong purpose. Prideis a sin that most easily besets us; it is sinful ambition to outdoothers in pomp and grandeur. To put down the vanity and ambition oftheir request, Christ leads them to the thoughts of their sufferings.It is a bitter cup that is to be drunk of; a cup of trembling, but notthe cup of the wicked. It is but a cup, it is but a draught, bitterperhaps, but soon emptied; it is a cup in the hand of a Father, Joh18:11. Baptism is an ordinance by which we are joined to the Lord incovenant and communion; and so is suffering for Christ, Eze 20:37; Isa48:10. Baptism is an outward and visible sign of an inward andspiritual grace; and so is suffering for Christ, for unto us it isgiven, Php 1:29. But they knew not what Christ's cup was, nor what hisbaptism. Those are commonly most confident, who are least acquaintedwith the cross. Nothing makes more mischief among brethren, than desireof greatness. And we never find Christ's disciples quarrelling, butsomething of this was at the bottom of it. That man who labours mostdiligently, and suffers most patiently, seeking to do good to hisbrethren, and to promote the salvation of souls, most resembles Christ,and will be most honoured by him to all eternity. Our Lord speaks ofhis death in the terms applied to the sacrifices of old. It is asacrifice for the sins of men, and is that true and substantialsacrifice, which those of the law faintly and imperfectly represented.It was a ransom for many, enough for all, working upon many; and, iffor many, then the poor trembling soul may say, Why not for me?
Mat 20:29-34	<br>It is good for those under the same trial, or infirmity of body ormind, to join in prayer to God for relief, that they may quicken andencourage one another. There is mercy enough in Christ for all thatask. They were earnest in prayer. They cried out as men in earnest.Cold desires beg denials. They were humble in prayer, castingthemselves upon, and referring themselves cheerfully to, the Mediator'smercy. They showed faith in prayer, by the title they gave to Christ.Surely it was by the Holy Ghost that they called Jesus, Lord. Theypersevered in prayer. When they were in pursuit of such mercy, it wasno time for timidity or hesitation: they cried earnestly. Christencouraged them. The wants and burdens of the body we are soon sensibleof, and can readily relate. Oh that we did as feelingly complain of ourspiritual maladies, especially our spiritual blindness! Many arespiritually blind, yet say they see. Jesus cured these blind men; andwhen they had received sight, they followed him. None follow Christblindly. He first by his grace opens men's eyes, and so draws theirhearts after him. These miracles are our call to Jesus; may we hear it,and make it our daily prayer to grow in grace and in the knowledge ofthe Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.
Mat 21:1-11	<br>This coming of Christ was described by the prophet Zechariah, Zec 9:9.When Christ would appear in his glory, it is in his meekness, not inhis majesty, in mercy to work salvation. As meekness and outwardpoverty were fully seen in Zion's King, and marked his triumphalentrance to Jerusalem, how wrong covetousness, ambition, and the prideof life must be in Zion's citizens! They brought the ass, but Jesus didnot use it without the owner's consent. The trappings were such as cameto hand. We must not think the clothes on our backs too dear to partwith for the service of Christ. The chief priests and the eldersafterwards joined with the multitude that abused him upon the cross;but none of them joined the multitude that did him honour. Those thattake Christ for their King, must lay their all under his feet. Hosannasignifies, Save now, we beseech thee! Blessed is he that cometh in thename of the Lord! But of how little value is the applause of thepeople! The changing multitude join the cry of the day, whether it beHosanna, or Crucify him. Multitudes often seem to approve the gospel,but few become consistent disciples. When Jesus was come into Jerusalemall the city was moved; some perhaps were moved with joy, who waitedfor the Consolation of Israel; others, of the Pharisees, were movedwith envy. So various are the motions in the minds of men upon theapproach of Christ's kingdom.
Mat 21:12-17	<br>Christ found some of the courts of the temple turned into a market forcattle and things used in the sacrifices, and partly occupied by themoney-changers. Our Lord drove them from the place, as he had done athis entering upon his ministry, Joh 2:13-17. His works testified of himmore than the hosannas; and his healing in the temple was thefulfilling the promise, that the glory of the latter house should begreater than the glory of the former. If Christ came now into manyparts of his visible church, how many secret evils he would discoverand cleanse! And how many things daily practised under the cloak ofreligion, would he show to be more suitable to a den of thieves than toa house of prayer!
Mat 21:18-22	<br>This cursing of the barren fig-tree represents the state of hypocritesin general, and so teaches us that Christ looks for the power ofreligion in those who profess it, and the savour of it from those thathave the show of it. His just expectations from flourishing professorsare often disappointed; he comes to many, seeking fruit, and findsleaves only. A false profession commonly withers in this world, and itis the effect of Christ's curse. The fig-tree that had no fruit, soonlost its leaves. This represents the state of the nation and people ofthe Jews in particular. Our Lord Jesus found among them nothing butleaves. And after they rejected Christ, blindness and hardness grewupon them, till they were undone, and their place and nation rooted up.The Lord was righteous in it. Let us greatly fear the doom denounced onthe barren fig-tree.
Mat 21:23-27	<br>As our Lord now openly appeared as the Messiah, the chief priests andscribes were much offended, especially because he exposed and removedthe abuses they encouraged. Our Lord asked what they thought of John'sministry and baptism. Many are more afraid of the shame of lying thanof the sin, and therefore scruple not to speak what they know to befalse, as to their own thoughts, affections, and intentions, or theirremembering and forgetting. Our Lord refused to answer their inquiry.It is best to shun needless disputes with wicked opposers.
Mat 21:28-32	<br>Parables which give reproof, speak plainly to the offenders, and judgethem out of their own mouths. The parable of the two sons sent to workin the vineyard, is to show that those who knew not John's baptism tobe of God, were shamed by those who knew it, and owned it. The wholehuman race are like children whom the Lord has brought up, but theyhave rebelled against him, only some are more plausible in theirdisobedience than others. And it often happens, that the daring rebelis brought to repentance and becomes the Lord's servant, while theformalist grows hardened in pride and enmity.
Mat 21:33-46	<br>This parable plainly sets forth the sin and ruin of the Jewish nation;and what is spoken to convict them, is spoken to caution all that enjoythe privileges of the outward church. As men treat God's people, theywould treat Christ himself, if he were with them. How can we, iffaithful to his cause, expect a favourable reception from a wickedworld, or from ungodly professors of Christianity! And let us askourselves, whether we who have the vineyard and all its advantages,render fruits in due season, as a people, as a family, or as separatepersons. Our Saviour, in his question, declares that the Lord of thevineyard will come, and when he comes he will surely destroy thewicked. The chief priests and the elders were the builders, and theywould not admit his doctrine or laws; they threw him aside as adespised stone. But he who was rejected by the Jews, was embraced bythe Gentiles. Christ knows who will bring forth gospel fruits in theuse of gospel means. The unbelief of sinners will be their ruin. ButGod has many ways of restraining the remainders of wrath, as he has ofmaking that which breaks out redound to his praise. May Christ becomemore and more precious to our souls, as the firm Foundation andCornerstone of his church. May we be willing to follow him, thoughdespised and hated for his sake.
Mat 22:1-14	<br>The provision made for perishing souls in the gospel, is represented bya royal feast made by a king, with eastern liberality, on the marriageof his son. Our merciful God has not only provided food, but a royalfeast, for the perishing souls of his rebellious creatures. There isenough and to spare, of every thing that can add to our present comfortand everlasting happiness, in the salvation of his Son Jesus Christ.The guests first invited were the Jews. When the prophets of the OldTestament prevailed not, nor John the Baptist, nor Christ himself, whotold them the kingdom of God was at hand, the apostles and ministers ofthe gospel were sent, after Christ's resurrection, to tell them it wascome, and to persuade them to accept the offer. The reason why sinnerscome not to Christ and salvation by him, is, not because they cannot,but because they will not. Making light of Christ, and of the greatsalvation wrought out by him, is the damning sin of the world. Theywere careless. Multitudes perish for ever through mere carelessness,who show no direct aversion, but are careless as to their souls. Alsothe business and profit of worldly employments hinder many in closingwith the Saviour. Both farmers and merchants must be diligent; butwhatever we have of the world in our hands, our care must be to keep itout of our hearts, lest it come between us and Christ. The utter ruincoming upon the Jewish church and nation, is here represented.Persecution of Christ's faithful ministers fills up the measure ofguilt of any people. The offer of Christ and salvation to the Gentileswas not expected; it was such a surprise as it would be to wayfaringmen, to be invited to a royal wedding-feast. The design of the gospelis to gather souls to Christ; all the children of God scattered abroad,Joh 10:16; 11:52. The case of hypocrites is represented by the guestthat had not on a wedding-garment. It concerns all to prepare for thescrutiny; and those, and those only, who put on the Lord Jesus, whohave a Christian temper of mind, who live by faith in Christ, and towhom he is all in all, have the wedding-garment. The imputedrighteousness of Christ, and the sanctification of the Spirit, are bothalike necessary. No man has the wedding-garment by nature, or can formit for himself. The day is coming, when hypocrites will be called toaccount for all their presumptuous intruding into gospel ordinances,and usurpation of gospel privileges. Take him away. Those that walkunworthy of Christianity, forfeit all the happiness they presumptuouslyclaimed. Our Saviour here passes out of the parable into that which itteaches. Hypocrites go by the light of the gospel itself down to utterdarkness. Many are called to the wedding-feast, that is, to salvation,but few have the wedding-garment, the righteousness of Christ, thesanctification of the Spirit. Then let us examine ourselves whether weare in the faith, and seek to be approved by the King.
Mat 22:15-22	<br>The Pharisees sent their disciples with the Herodians, a party amongthe Jews, who were for full subjection to the Roman emperor. Thoughopposed to each other, they joined against Christ. What they said ofChrist was right; whether they knew it or not, blessed be God we knowit. Jesus Christ was a faithful Teacher, and a bold reprover. Christsaw their wickedness. Whatever mask the hypocrite puts on, our LordJesus sees through it. Christ did not interpose as a judge in mattersof this nature, for his kingdom is not of this world, but he enjoinspeaceable subjection to the powers that be. His adversaries werereproved, and his disciples were taught that the Christian religion isno enemy to civil government. Christ is, and will be, the wonder, notonly of his friends, but of his enemies. They admire his wisdom, butwill not be guided by it; his power, but will not submit to it.
Mat 22:23-33	<br>The doctrines of Christ displeased the infidel Sadducees, as well asthe Pharisees and Herodians. He carried the great truths of theresurrection and a future state, further than they had yet beenreveled. There is no arguing from the state of things in this world, asto what will take place hereafter. Let truth be set in a clear light,and it appears in full strength. Having thus silenced them, our Lordproceeded to show the truth of the doctrine of the resurrection fromthe books of Moses. God declared to Moses that he was the God of thepatriarchs, who had died long before; this shows that they were then ina state of being, capable of enjoying his favour, and proves that thedoctrine of the resurrection is clearly taught in the Old Testament aswell as in the New. But this doctrine was kept for a more fullrevelation, after the resurrection of Christ, who was the first-fruitsof them that slept. All errors arise from not knowing the Scripturesand the power of God. In this world death takes away one after another,and so ends all earthly hopes, joys, sorrows, and connexions. Howwretched are those who look for nothing better beyond the grave!
Mat 22:34-40	<br>An interpreter of the law asked our Lord a question, to try, not somuch his knowledge, as his judgment. The love of God is the first andgreat commandment, and the sum of all the commands of the first table.Our love of God must be sincere, not in word and tongue only. All ourlove is too little to bestow upon him, therefore all the powers of thesoul must be engaged for him, and carried out toward him. To love ourneighbour as ourselves, is the second great commandment. There is aself-love which is corrupt, and the root of the greatest sins, and itmust be put off and mortified; but there is a self-love which is therule of the greatest duty: we must have a due concern for the welfareof our own souls and bodies. And we must love our neighbour as trulyand sincerely as we love ourselves; in many cases we must denyourselves for the good of others. By these two commandments let ourhearts be formed as by a mould.
Mat 22:41-46	<br>When Christ baffled his enemies, he asked what thoughts they had of thepromised Messiah? How he could be the Son of David and yet his Lord? Hequotes Ps 110:1. If the Christ was to be a mere man, who would notexist till many ages after David's death, how could his forefather callhim Lord? The Pharisees could not answer it. Nor can any solve thedifficulty except he allows the Messiah to be the Son of God, andDavid's Lord equally with the Father. He took upon him human nature,and so became God manifested in the flesh; in this sense he is the Sonof man and the Son of David. It behoves us above all things seriouslyto inquire, "What think we of Christ?" Is he altogether glorious in oureyes, and precious to our hearts? May Christ be our joy, ourconfidence, our all. May we daily be made more like to him, and moredevoted to his service.
Mat 23:1-12	<br>The scribes and Pharisees explained the law of Moses, and enforcedobedience to it. They are charged with hypocrisy in religion. We canonly judge according to outward appearance; but God searches the heart.They made phylacteries. These were scrolls of paper or parchment,wherein were written four paragraphs of the law, to be worn on theirforeheads and left arms, Ex 13:2-10; 13:11-16; De 6:4-9; 11:13-21. Theymade these phylacteries broad, that they might be thought more zealousfor the law than others. God appointed the Jews to make fringes upontheir garments, Nu 15:38, to remind them of their being a peculiarpeople; but the Pharisees made them larger than common, as if they werethereby more religious than others. Pride was the darling, reigning sinof the Pharisees, the sin that most easily beset them, and which ourLord Jesus takes all occasions to speak against. For him that is taughtin the word to give respect to him that teaches, is commendable; butfor him that teaches, to demand it, to be puffed up with it, is sinful.How much is all this against the spirit of Christianity! The consistentdisciple of Christ is pained by being put into chief places. But whothat looks around on the visible church, would think this was thespirit required? It is plain that some measure of this antichristianspirit prevails in every religious society, and in every one of ourhearts.
Mat 23:13-33	<br>The scribes and Pharisees were enemies to the gospel of Christ, andtherefore to the salvation of the souls of men. It is bad to keep awayfrom Christ ourselves, but worse also to keep others from him. Yet itis no new thing for the show and form of godliness to be made a cloakto the greatest enormities. But dissembled piety will be reckoneddouble iniquity. They were very busy to turn souls to be of theirparty. Not for the glory of God and the good of souls, but that theymight have the credit and advantage of making converts. Gain beingtheir godliness, by a thousand devices they made religion give way totheir worldly interests. They were very strict and precise in smallermatters of the law, but careless and loose in weightier matters. It isnot the scrupling a little sin that Christ here reproves; if it be asin, though but a gnat, it must be strained out; but the doing that,and then swallowing a camel, or, committing a greater sin. While theywould seem to be godly, they were neither sober nor righteous. We arereally, what we are inwardly. Outward motives may keep the outsideclean, while the inside is filthy; but if the heart and spirit be madenew, there will be newness of life; here we must begin with ourselves.The righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees was like the ornamentsof a grave, or dressing up a dead body, only for show. Thedeceitfulness of sinners' hearts appears in that they go down thestreams of the sins of their own day, while they fancy that they shouldhave opposed the sins of former days. We sometimes think, if we hadlived when Christ was upon earth, that we should not have despised andrejected him, as men then did; yet Christ in his Spirit, in his word,in his ministers, is still no better treated. And it is just with Godto give those up to their hearts' lusts, who obstinately persist ingratifying them. Christ gives men their true characters.
Mat 23:34-39	<br>Our Lord declares the miseries the inhabitants of Jerusalem were aboutto bring upon themselves, but he does not notice the sufferings he wasto undergo. A hen gathering her chickens under her wings, is an aptemblem of the Saviour's tender love to those who trust in him, and hisfaithful care of them. He calls sinners to take refuge under his tenderprotection, keeps them safe, and nourishes them to eternal life. Thepresent dispersion and unbelief of the Jews, and their futureconversion to Christ, were here foretold. Jerusalem and her childrenhad a large share of guilt, and their punishment has been signal. Butere long, deserved vengeance will fall on every church which isChristian in name only. In the mean time the Saviour stands ready toreceive all who come to him. There is nothing between sinners andeternal happiness, but their proud and unbelieving unwillingness.
Mat 24:1-3	<br>Christ foretells the utter ruin and destruction coming upon the temple.A believing foresight of the defacing of all worldly glory, will helpto keep us from admiring it, and overvaluing it. The most beautifulbody soon will be food for worms, and the most magnificent building aruinous heap. See ye not all these things? It will do us good so to seethem as to see through them, and see to the end of them. Our Lordhaving gone with his disciples to the Mount of Olives, he set beforethem the order of the times concerning the Jews, till the destructionof Jerusalem; and as to men in general till the end of the world.
Mat 24:4-28	<br>The disciples had asked concerning the times, When these things shouldbe? Christ gave them no answer to that; but they had also asked, Whatshall be the sign? This question he answers fully. The prophecy firstrespects events near at hand, the destruction of Jerusalem, the end ofthe Jewish church and state, the calling of the Gentiles, and thesetting up of Christ's kingdom in the world; but it also looks to thegeneral judgment; and toward the close, points more particularly to thelatter. What Christ here said to his disciples, tended more to promotecaution than to satisfy their curiosity; more to prepare them for theevents that should happen, than to give a distinct idea of the events.This is that good understanding of the times which all should covet,thence to infer what Israel ought to do. Our Saviour cautions hisdisciples to stand on their guard against false teachers. And heforetells wars and great commotions among nations. From the time thatthe Jews rejected Christ, and he left their house desolate, the swordnever departed from them. See what comes of refusing the gospel. Thosewho will not hear the messengers of peace, shall be made to hear themessengers of war. But where the heart is fixed, trusting in God, it iskept in peace, and is not afraid. It is against the mind of Christ,that his people should have troubled hearts, even in troublous times.When we looked forward to the eternity of misery that is before theobstinate refusers of Christ and his gospel, we may truly say, Thegreatest earthly judgments are but the beginning of sorrows. It iscomforting that some shall endure even to the end. Our Lord foretellsthe preaching of the gospel in all the world. The end of the worldshall not be till the gospel has done its work. Christ foretells theruin coming upon the people of the Jews; and what he said here, wouldbe of use to his disciples, for their conduct and for their comfort. IfGod opens a door of escape, we ought to make our escape, otherwise wedo not trust God, but tempt him. It becomes Christ's disciples, intimes of public trouble, to be much in prayer: that is never out ofseason, but in a special manner seasonable when we are distressed onevery side. Though we must take what God sends, yet we may pray againstsufferings; and it is very trying to a good man, to be taken by anywork of necessity from the solemn service and worship of God on thesabbath day. But here is one word of comfort, that for the elect's sakethese days shall be made shorter than their enemies designed, who wouldhave cut all off, if God, who used these foes to serve his own purpose,had not set bounds to their wrath. Christ foretells the rapid spreadingof the gospel in the world. It is plainly seen as the lightning. Christpreached his gospel openly. The Romans were like an eagle, and theensign of their armies was an eagle. When a people, by their sin, makethemselves as loathsome carcasses, nothing can be expected but that Godshould send enemies to destroy them. It is very applicable to the dayof judgment, the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ in that day, 2Th 2:1.Let us give diligence to make our calling and election sure; then maywe know that no enemy or deceiver shall ever prevail against us.
Mat 24:29-41	<br>Christ foretells his second coming. It is usual for prophets to speakof things as near and just at hand, to express the greatness andcertainty of them. Concerning Christ's second coming, it is foretoldthat there shall be a great change, in order to the making all thingsnew. Then they shall see the Son of man coming in the clouds. At hisfirst coming, he was set for a sign that should be spoken against, butat his second coming, a sign that should be admired. Sooner or later,all sinners will be mourners; but repenting sinners look to Christ, andmourn after a godly sort; and those who sow in those tears shallshortly reap in joy. Impenitent sinners shall see Him whom they havepierced, and, though they laugh now, shall mourn and weep in endlesshorror and despair. The elect of God are scattered abroad; there aresome in all places, and all nations; but when that great gathering daycomes, there shall not one of them be missing. Distance of place shallkeep none out of heaven. Our Lord declares that the Jews should nevercease to be a distinct people, until all things he had been predictingwere fulfilled. His prophecy reaches to the day of final judgment;therefore he here, ver. 34, foretells that Judah shall never cease toexist as a distinct people, so long as this world shall endure. Men ofthe world scheme and plan for generation upon generation here, but theyplan not with reference to the overwhelming, approaching, and mostcertain event of Christ's second coming, which shall do away everyhuman scheme, and set aside for ever all that God forbids. That will beas surprising a day, as the deluge to the old world. Apply this, first,to temporal judgments, particularly that which was then hastening uponthe nation and people of the Jews. Secondly, to the eternal judgment.Christ here shows the state of the old world when the deluge came. Theywere secure and careless; they knew not, until the flood came; and theybelieved not. Did we know aright that all earthly things must shortlypass away, we should not set our eyes and hearts so much upon them aswe do. The evil day is not the further off for men's putting it farfrom them. What words can more strongly describe the suddenness of ourSaviour's coming! Men will be at their respective businesses, andsuddenly the Lord of glory will appear. Women will be in their houseemployments, but in that moment every other work will be laid aside,and every heart will turn inward and say, It is the Lord! Am I preparedto meet him? Can I stand before him? And what, in fact, is the day ofjudgment to the whole world, but the day of death to every one?
Mat 24:42-51	<br>To watch for Christ's coming, is to maintain that temper of mind whichwe would be willing that our Lord should find us in. We know we havebut a little time to live, we cannot know that we have a long time tolive; much less do we know the time fixed for the judgment. Our Lord'scoming will be happy to those that shall be found ready, but verydreadful to those that are not. If a man, professing to be the servantof Christ, be an unbeliever, covetous, ambitious, or a lover ofpleasure, he will be cut off. Those who choose the world for theirportion in this life, will have hell for their portion in the otherlife. May our Lord, when he cometh, pronounce us blessed, and presentus to the Father, washed in his blood, purified by his Spirit, and fitto be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light.
Mat 25:1-13	<br>The circumstances of the parable of the ten virgins were taken from themarriage customs among the Jews, and explain the great day of Christ'scoming. See the nature of Christianity. As Christians we profess toattend upon Christ, to honour him, also to be waiting for his coming.Sincere Christians are the wise virgins, and hypocrites the foolishones. Those are the truly wise or foolish that are so in the affairs oftheir souls. Many have a lamp of profession in their hands, but havenot, in their hearts, sound knowledge and settled resolution, which areneeded to carry them through the services and trials of the presentstate. Their hearts are not stored with holy dispositions, by thenew-creating Spirit of God. Our light must shine before men in goodworks; but this is not likely to be long done, unless there is a fixed,active principle in the heart, of faith in Christ, and love to God andour brethren. They all slumbered and slept. The delay represents thespace between the real or apparent conversion of these professors, andthe coming of Christ, to take them away by death, or to judge theworld. But though Christ tarry past our time, he will not tarry pastthe due time. The wise virgins kept their lamps burning, but they didnot keep themselves awake. Too many real Christians grow remiss, andone degree of carelessness makes way for another. Those that allowthemselves to slumber, will scarcely keep from sleeping; thereforedread the beginning of spiritual decays. A startling summons was given.Go ye forth to meet Him, is a call to those prepared. The notice ofChrist's approach, and the call to meet him, will awaken. Even thosebest prepared for death have work to do to get actually ready, 2Pe3:14. It will be a day of search and inquiry; and it concerns us tothink how we shall then be found. Some wanted oil to supply their lampswhen going out. Those that take up short of true grace, will certainlyfind the want of it one time or other. An outward profession may lighta man along this world, but the damps of the valley of the shadow ofdeath will put out such a light. Those who care not to live the life,yet would die the death of the righteous. But those that would besaved, must have grace of their own; and those that have most grace,have none to spare. The best need more from Christ. And while the pooralarmed soul addresses itself, upon a sick-bed, to repentance andprayer, in awful confusion, death comes, judgment comes, the work isundone, and the poor sinner is undone for ever. This comes of havingoil to buy when we should burn it, grace to get when we should use it.Those, and those only, shall go to heaven hereafter, that are madeready for heaven here. The suddenness of death and of Christ's comingto us then, will not hinder our happiness, if we have been prepared.The door was shut. Many will seek admission into heaven when it is toolate. The vain confidence of hypocrites will carry them far inexpectations of happiness. The unexpected summons of death may alarmthe Christian; but, proceeding without delay to trim his lamp, hisgraces often shine more bright; while the mere professor's conductshows that his lamp is going out. Watch therefore, attend to thebusiness of your souls. Be in the fear of the Lord all the day long.
Mat 25:14-30	<br>Christ keeps no servants to be idle: they have received their all fromhim, and have nothing they can call their own but sin. Our receivingfrom Christ is in order to our working for him. The manifestation ofthe Spirit is given to every man to profit withal. The day of accountcomes at last. We must all be reckoned with as to what good we have gotto our own souls, and have done to others, by the advantages we haveenjoyed. It is not meant that the improving of natural powers canentitle a man to Divine grace. It is the real Christian's liberty andprivilege to be employed as his Redeemer's servant, in promoting hisglory, and the good of his people: the love of Christ constrains him tolive no longer to himself, but to Him that died for him, and roseagain. Those who think it impossible to please God, and in vain toserve him, will do nothing to purpose in religion. They complain thatHe requires of them more than they are capable of, and punishes themfor what they cannot help. Whatever they may pretend, the fact is, theydislike the character and work of the Lord. The slothful servant issentenced to be deprived of his talent. This may be applied to theblessings of this life; but rather to the means of grace. Those whoknow not the day of their visitation, shall have the things that belongto their peace hid from their eyes. His doom is, to be cast into outerdarkness. It is a usual way of expressing the miseries of the damned inhell. Here, as in what was said to the faithful servants, our Saviourgoes out of the parable into the thing intended by it, and this servesas a key to the whole. Let us not envy sinners, or covet any of theirperishing possessions.
Mat 25:31-46	<br>This is a description of the last judgment. It is as an explanation ofthe former parables. There is a judgment to come, in which every manshall be sentenced to a state of everlasting happiness, or misery.Christ shall come, not only in the glory of his Father, but in his ownglory, as Mediator. The wicked and godly here dwell together, in thesame cities, churches, families, and are not always to be known the onefrom the other; such are the weaknesses of saints, such the hypocrisiesof sinners; and death takes both: but in that day they will be partedfor ever. Jesus Christ is the great Shepherd; he will shortlydistinguish between those that are his, and those that are not. Allother distinctions will be done away; but the great one between saintsand sinners, holy and unholy, will remain for ever. The happiness thesaints shall possess is very great. It is a kingdom; the most valuablepossession on earth; yet this is but a faint resemblance of the blessedstate of the saints in heaven. It is a kingdom prepared. The Fatherprovided it for them in the greatness of his wisdom and power; the Sonpurchased it for them; and the blessed Spirit, in preparing them forthe kingdom, is preparing it for them. It is prepared for them: it isin all points adapted to the new nature of a sanctified soul. It isprepared from the foundation of the world. This happiness was for thesaints, and they for it, from all eternity. They shall come and inheritit. What we inherit is not got by ourselves. It is God that makes heirsof heaven. We are not to suppose that acts of bounty will entitle toeternal happiness. Good works done for God's sake, through JesusChrist, are here noticed as marking the character of believers madeholy by the Spirit of Christ, and as the effects of grace bestowed onthose who do them. The wicked in this world were often called to cometo Christ for life and rest, but they turned from his calls; and justlyare those bid to depart from Christ, that would not come to him.Condemned sinners will in vain offer excuses. The punishment of thewicked will be an everlasting punishment; their state cannot bealtered. Thus life and death, good and evil, the blessing and thecurse, are set before us, that we may choose our way, and as our way soshall our end be.
Mat 26:1-5	<br>Our Lord had often told of his sufferings as at a distance, now hespeaks of them as at hand. At the same time the Jewish councilconsulted how they might put him to death secretly. But it pleased Godto defeat their intention. Jesus, the true paschal Lamb, was to besacrificed for us at that very time, and his death and resurrectionrendered public.
Mat 26:6-13	<br>The pouring ointment upon the head of Christ was a token of the highestrespect. Where there is true love in the heart to Jesus Christ, nothingwill be thought too good to bestow upon him. The more Christ's servantsand their services are cavilled at, the more he manifests hisacceptance. This act of faith and love was so remarkable, that it wouldbe reported, as a memorial of Mary's faith and love, to all futureages, and in all places where the gospel should be preached. Thisprophecy is fulfilled.
Mat 26:14-16	<br>There were but twelve called apostles, and one of them was like adevil; surely we must never expect any society to be quite pure on thisside heaven. The greater profession men make of religion, the greateropportunity they have of doing mischief, if their hearts be not rightwith God. Observe, that Christ's own disciple, who knew so well hisdoctrine and manner of his life, and was false to him, could not chargehim with any thing criminal, though it would have served to justify histreachery. What did Judas want? Was not he welcome wherever his Masterwas? Did he not fare as Christ fared? It is not the lack, but the loveof money, that is the root of all evil. After he had made that wickedbargain, Judas had time to repent, and to revoke it; but when lesseracts of dishonesty have hardened the conscience men do withouthesitation that which is more shameful.
Mat 26:17-25	<br>Observe, the place for their eating the passover was pointed out byChrist to the disciples. He knows those hidden ones who favour hiscause, and will graciously visit all who are willing to receive him.The disciples did as Jesus had appointed. Those who would have Christ'spresence in the gospel passover, must do what he says. It well becomesthe disciples of Christ always to be jealous over themselves,especially in trying times. We know not how strongly we may be tempted,nor how far God may leave us to ourselves, therefore we have reason notto be high-minded, but to fear. Heart-searching examination and ferventprayer are especially proper before the Lord's supper, that, as Christour Passover is now sacrificed for us, we may keep this feast, renewingour repentance, our faith in his blood, and surrendering ourselves tohis service.
Mat 26:26-30	<br>This ordinance of the Lord's supper is to us the passover supper, bywhich we commemorate a much greater deliverance than that of Israel outof Egypt. Take, eat; accept of Christ as he is offered to you; receivethe atonement, approve of it, submit to his grace and his government.Meat looked upon, be the dish ever so well garnished, will not nourish;it must be fed upon: so must the doctrine of Christ. This is my body;that is, spiritually, it signifies and represents his body. We partakeof the sun, not by having the sun put into our hands, but the beams ofit darted down upon us; so we partake of Christ by partaking of hisgrace, and the blessed fruits of the breaking of his body. The blood ofChrist is signified and represented by the wine. He gave thanks, toteach us to look to God in every part of the ordinance. This cup hegave to the disciples with a command, Drink ye all of it. The pardon ofsin is that great blessing which is, in the Lord's supper, conferred onall true believers; it is the foundation of all other blessings. Hetakes leave of such communion; and assures them of a happy meetingagain at last; "Until that day when I drink it new with you\rdblquote ,may be understood of the joys and glories of the future state, whichthe saints shall partake with the Lord Jesus. That will be the kingdomof his Father; the wine of consolation will there be always new. Whilewe look at the outward signs of Christ's body broken and his blood shedfor the remission of our sins, let us recollect that the feast cost himas much as though he had literally given his flesh to be eaten and hisblood for us to drink.
Mat 26:31-35	<br>Improper self-confidence, like that of Peter, is the first step to afall. There is a proneness in all of us to be over-confident. But thosefall soonest and foulest, who are the most confident in themselves.Those are least safe, who think themselves most secure. Satan is activeto lead such astray; they are most off their guard: God leaves them tothemselves, to humble them.
Mat 26:36-46	<br>He who made atonement for the sins of mankind, submitted himself in agarden of suffering, to the will of God, from which man had revolted ina garden of pleasure. Christ took with him into that part of the gardenwhere he suffered his agony, only those who had witnessed his glory inhis transfiguration. Those are best prepared to suffer with Christ, whohave by faith beheld his glory. The words used denote the most entiredejection, amazement, anguish, and horror of mind; the state of onesurrounded with sorrows, overwhelmed with miseries, and almostswallowed up with terror and dismay. He now began to be sorrowful, andnever ceased to be so till he said, It is finished. He prayed that, ifpossible, the cup might pass from him. But he also showed his perfectreadiness to bear the load of his sufferings; he was willing to submitto all for our redemption and salvation. According to this example ofChrist, we must drink of the bitterest cup which God puts into ourhands; though nature struggle, it must submit. It should be more ourcare to get troubles sanctified, and our hearts satisfied under them,than to get them taken away. It is well for us that our salvation is inthe hand of One who neither slumbers nor sleeps. All are tempted, butwe should be much afraid of entering into temptation. To be securedfrom this, we should watch and pray, and continually look unto the Lordto hold us up that we may be safe. Doubtless our Lord had a clear andfull view of the sufferings he was to endure, yet he spoke with thegreatest calmness till this time. Christ was a Surety, who undertook tobe answerable for our sins. Accordingly he was made sin for us, andsuffered for our sins, the Just for the unjust; and Scripture ascribeshis heaviest sufferings to the hand of God. He had full knowledge ofthe infinite evil of sin, and of the immense extent of that guilt forwhich he was to atone; with awful views of the Divine justice andholiness, and the punishment deserved by the sins of men, such as notongue can express, or mind conceive. At the same time, Christ sufferedbeing tempted; probably horrible thoughts were suggested by Satan thattended to gloom and every dreadful conclusion: these would be the morehard to bear from his perfect holiness. And did the load of imputedguilt so weigh down the soul of Him of whom it is said, He upholdethall things by the word of his power? into what misery then must thosesink whose sins are left upon their own heads! How will those escapewho neglect so great salvation?
Mat 26:47-56	<br>No enemies are so much to be abhorred as those professed disciples thatbetray Christ with a kiss. God has no need of our services, much lessof our sins, to bring about his purposes. Though Christ was crucifiedthrough weakness, it was voluntary weakness; he submitted to death. Ifhe had not been willing to suffer, they could not conquer him. It was agreat sin for those who had left all to follow Jesus; now to leave himfor they knew not what. What folly, for fear of death to flee from Him,whom they knew and acknowledged to be the Fountain of life!
Mat 26:57-68	<br>Jesus was hurried into Jerusalem. It looks ill, and bodes worse, whenthose who are willing to be Christ's disciples, are not willing to beknown to be so. Here began Peter's denying him: for to follow Christafar off, is to begin to go back from him. It is more our concern toprepare for the end, whatever it may be, than curiously to ask what theend will be. The event is God's, but the duty is ours. Now theScriptures were fulfilled, which said, False witnesses are risen upagainst me. Christ was accused, that we might not be condemned; and ifat any time we suffer thus, let us remember we cannot expect to farebetter than our Master. When Christ was made sin for us, he was silent,and left it to his blood to speak. Hitherto Jesus had seldom professedexpressly to be the Christ, the Son of God; the tenor of his doctrinespoke it, and his miracles proved it; but now he would not omit to makean open confession of it. It would have looked like declining hissufferings. He thus confessed, as an example and encouragement to hisfollowers, to confess him before men, whatever hazard they ran.Disdain, cruel mocking, and abhorrence, are the sure portion of thedisciple as they were of the Master, from such as would buffet andderide the Lord of glory. These things were exactly foretold in thefiftieth chapter of Isaiah. Let us confess Christ's name, and bear thereproach, and he will confess us before his Father's throne.
Mat 26:69-75	<br>Peter's sin is truly related, for the Scriptures deal faithfully. Badcompany leads to sin: those who needlessly thrust themselves into it,may expect to be tempted and insnared, as Peter. They scarcely can comeout of such company without guilt or grief, or both. It is a greatfault to be shy of Christ; and to dissemble our knowledge of him, whenwe are called to own him, is, in effect, to deny him. Peter's sin wasaggravated; but he fell into the sin by surprise, not as Judas, withdesign. But conscience should be to us as the crowing of the cock, toput us in mind of the sins we had forgotten. Peter was thus left tofall, to abate his self-confidence, and render him more modest, humble,compassionate, and useful to others. The event has taught believersmany things ever since, and if infidels, Pharisees, and hypocritesstumble at it or abuse it, it is at their peril. Little do we know howwe should act in very difficult situations, if we were left toourselves. Let him, therefore, that thinketh he standeth, take heedlest he fall; let us all distrust our own hearts, and rely wholly onthe Lord. Peter wept bitterly. Sorrow for sin must not be slight, butgreat and deep. Peter, who wept so bitterly for denying Christ, neverdenied him again, but confessed him often in the face of danger. Truerepentance for any sin will be shown by the contrary grace and duty;that is a sign of our sorrowing not only bitterly, but sincerely.
Mat 27:1-10	<br>Wicked men see little of the consequences of their crimes when theycommit them, but they must answer for them all. In the fullest mannerJudas acknowledged to the chief priests that he had sinned, andbetrayed an innocent person. This was full testimony to the characterof Christ; but the rulers were hardened. Casting down the money, Judasdeparted, and went and hanged himself, not being able to bear theterror of Divine wrath, and the anguish of despair. There is littledoubt but that the death of Judas was before that of our blessed Lord.But was it nothing to them that they had thirsted after this blood, andhired Judas to betray it, and had condemned it to be shed unjustly?Thus do fools make a mock at sin. Thus many make light of Christcrucified. And it is a common instance of the deceitfulness of ourhearts, to make light of our own sin by dwelling upon other people'ssins. But the judgment of God is according to truth. Many apply thispassage of the buying the piece of ground, with the money Judas broughtback, to signify the favour intended by the blood of Christ tostrangers, and sinners of the Gentiles. It fulfilled a prophecy, Zec11:12. Judas went far toward repentance, yet it was not to salvation.He confessed, but not to God; he did not go to him, and say, I havesinned, Father, against heaven. Let none be satisfied with such partialconvictions as a man may have, and yet remain full of pride, enmity,and rebellion.
Mat 27:11-25	<br>Having no malice against Jesus, Pilate urged him to clear himself, andlaboured to get him discharged. The message from his wife was awarning. God has many ways of giving checks to sinners, in their sinfulpursuits, and it is a great mercy to have such checks from Providence,from faithful friends, and from our own consciences. O do not thisabominable thing which the Lord hates! is what we may hear said to us,when we are entering into temptation, if we will but regard it. Beingoverruled by the priests, the people made choice of Barabbas.Multitudes who choose the world, rather than God, for their ruler andportion, thus choose their own delusions. The Jews were so bent uponthe death of Christ, that Pilate thought it would be dangerous torefuse. And this struggle shows the power of conscience even on theworst men. Yet all was so ordered to make it evident that Christsuffered for no fault of his own, but for the sins of his people. Howvain for Pilate to expect to free himself from the guilt of theinnocent blood of a righteous person, whom he was by his office boundto protect! The Jews' curse upon themselves has been awfully answeredin the sufferings of their nation. None could bear the sin of others,except Him that had no sin of his own to answer for. And are we not allconcerned? Is not Barabbas preferred to Jesus, when sinners rejectsalvation that they may retain their darling sins, which rob God of hisglory, and murder their souls? The blood of Christ is now upon us forgood, through mercy, by the Jews' rejection of it. O let us flee to itfor refuge!
Mat 27:26-30	<br>Crucifixion was a death used only among the Romans; it was veryterrible and miserable. A cross was laid on the ground, to which thehands and feet were nailed, it was then lifted up and fixed upright, sothat the weight of the body hung on the nails, till the sufferer diedin agony. Christ thus answered the type of the brazen serpent raised ona pole. Christ underwent all the misery and shame here related, that hemight purchase for us everlasting life, and joy, and glory.
Mat 27:31-34	<br>Christ was led as a Lamb to the slaughter, as a Sacrifice to the altar.Even the mercies of the wicked are really cruel. Taking the cross fromhim, they compelled one Simon to bear it. Make us ready, O Lord, tobear the cross thou hast appointed us, and daily to take it up withcheerfulness, following thee. Was ever sorrow like unto his sorrow? Andwhen we behold what manner of death he died, let us in that behold withwhat manner of love he loved us. As if death, so painful a death, werenot enough, they added to its bitterness and terror in several ways.
Mat 27:35-44	<br>It was usual to put shame upon malefactors, by a writing to notify thecrime for which they suffered. So they set up one over Christ's head.This they designed for his reproach, but God so overruled it, that evenhis accusation was to his honour. There were crucified with him at thesame time, two robbers. He was, at his death, numbered among thetransgressors, that we, at our death, might be numbered among thesaints. The taunts and jeers he received are here recorded. The enemiesof Christ labour to make others believe that of religion and of thepeople of God, which they themselves know to be false. The chiefpriests and scribes, and the elders, upbraid Jesus with being the Kingof Israel. Many people could like the King of Israel well enough, if hewould but come down from the cross; if they could but have his kingdomwithout the tribulation through which they must enter into it. But ifno cross, then no Christ, no crown. Those that would reign with him,must be willing to suffer with him. Thus our Lord Jesus, havingundertaken to satisfy the justice of God, did it, by submitting to thepunishment of the worst of men. And in every minute particular recordedabout the sufferings of Christ, we find some prediction in the Prophetsor the Psalms fulfilled.
Mat 27:45-50	<br>During the three hours which the darkness continued, Jesus was inagony, wrestling with the powers of darkness, and suffering hisFather's displeasure against the sin of man, for which he was nowmaking his soul an offering. Never were there three such hours sincethe day God created man upon the earth, never such a dark and awfulscene; it was the turning point of that great affair, man's redemptionand salvation. Jesus uttered a complaint from Ps 22:1. Hereby heteaches of what use the word of God is to direct us in prayer, andrecommends the use of Scripture expressions in prayer. The believer mayhave tasted some drops of bitterness, but he can only form a veryfeeble idea of the greatness of Christ's sufferings. Yet, hence helearns something of the Saviour's love to sinners; hence he gets deeperconviction of the vileness and evil of sin, and of what he owes toChrist, who delivers him from the wrath to come. His enemies wickedlyridiculed his complaint. Many of the reproaches cast upon the word ofGod and the people of God, arise, as here, from gross mistakes. Christ,just before he expired, spake in his full strength, to show that hislife was not forced from him, but was freely delivered into hisFather's hands. He had strength to bid defiance to the powers of death:and to show that by the eternal Spirit he offered himself, being thePriest as well as the Sacrifice, he cried with a loud voice. Then heyielded up the ghost. The Son of God upon the cross, did die by theviolence of the pain he was put to. His soul was separated from hisbody, and so his body was left really and truly dead. It was certainthat Christ did die, for it was needful that he should die. He hadundertaken to make himself an offering for sin, and he did it when hewillingly gave up his life.
Mat 27:51-56	<br>The rending of the veil signified that Christ, by his death, opened away to God. We have an open way through Christ to the throne of grace,or mercy-seat now, and to the throne of glory hereafter. When we dulyconsider Christ's death, our hard and rocky hearts should be rent; theheart, and not the garments. That heart is harder than a rock that willnot yield, that will not melt, where Jesus Christ is plainly set forthcrucified. The graves were opened, and many bodies of saints whichslept, arose. To whom they appeared, in what manner, and how theydisappeared, we are not told; and we must not desire to be wise abovewhat is written. The dreadful appearances of God in his providence,sometimes work strangely for the conviction and awakening of sinners.This was expressed in the terror that fell upon the centurion and theRoman soldiers. We may reflect with comfort on the abundant testimoniesgiven to the character of Jesus; and, seeking to give no just cause ofoffence, we may leave it to the Lord to clear our characters, if welive to Him. Let us, with an eye of faith, behold Christ and himcrucified, and be affected with that great love wherewith he loved us.But his friends could give no more than a look; they beheld him, butcould not help him. Never were the horrid nature and effects of sin sotremendously displayed, as on that day when the beloved Son of theFather hung upon the cross, suffering for sin, the Just for the unjust,that he might bring us to God. Let us yield ourselves willingly to hisservice.
Mat 27:57-61	<br>In the burial of Christ was nothing of pomp or solemnity. As Christ hadnot a house of his own, wherein to lay his head, while he lived, so hehad not a grave of his own, wherein to lay his body, when he was dead.Our Lord Jesus, who had no sin of his own, had no grave of his own. TheJews designed that he should have made his grave with the wicked,should have been buried with the thieves with whom he was crucified,but God overruled it, so that he should make it with the rich in hisdeath, Isa 53:9. And although to the eye of man the beholding a funeralmay cause terror, yet if we remember how Christ by his burial haschanged the nature of the grave to believers, it should make usrejoice. And we are ever to imitate Christ's burial in beingcontinually occupied in the spiritual burial of our sins.
Mat 27:62-66	<br>On the Jewish sabbath, the chief priests and Pharisees, when theyshould have been at their devotions, were dealing with Pilate aboutsecuring the sepulchre. This was permitted that there might be certainproof of our Lord's resurrection. Pilate told them that they mightsecure the sepulchre as carefully as they could. They sealed the stone,and set a guard, and were satisfied that all needful care was taken.But to guard the sepulchre against the poor weak disciples was folly,because needless; while to think to guard it against the power of God,was folly, because fruitless, and to no purpose; yet they thought theydealt wisely. But the Lord took the wise in their own craftiness. Thusshall all the rage and the plans of Christ's enemies be made to promotehis glory.
Mat 28:1-8	<br>Christ rose the third day after his death; that was the time he hadoften spoken of. On the first day of the first week God commanded thelight to shine out of darkness. On this day did He who is the Light ofthe world, shine out of the darkness of the grave; and this day is fromhenceforward often mentioned in the New Testament, as the day whichChristians religiously observed in solemn assemblies, to the honour ofChrist. Our Lord Jesus could have rolled back the stone by his ownpower, but he chose to have it done by an angel. The resurrection ofChrist, as it is the joy of his friends, so it is the terror andconfusion of his enemies. The angel encouraged the women against theirfears. Let the sinners in Zion be afraid. Fear not ye, for hisresurrection will be your consolation. Our communion with him must bespiritual, by faith in his word. When we are ready to make this worldour home, and to say, It is good to be here, then let us remember ourLord Jesus is not here, he is risen; therefore let our hearts rise, andseek the things that are above. He is risen, as he said. Let us neverthink that strange which the word of Christ has told us to expect;whether the sufferings of this present time, or the glory that is to berevealed. It may have a good effect upon us, by faith to view the placewhere the Lord lay. Go quickly. It was good to be there, but theservants of God have other work appointed. Public usefulness must bechosen before the pleasure of secret communion with God. Tell thedisciples, that they may be comforted under their present sorrows.Christ knows where his disciples dwell, and will visit them. Even tothose at a distance from the plenty of the means of grace, he willgraciously manifest himself. The fear and the joy together quickenedtheir pace. The disciples of Christ should be forward to make known toeach other their experiences of communion with their Lord; and shouldtell others what God has done for their souls.
Mat 28:9,10	<br>God's gracious visits usually meet us in the way of duty; and to thosewho use what they have for others' benefit, more shall be given. Thisinterview with Christ was unexpected; but Christ was nigh them, andstill is nigh us in the word. The salutation speaks the good-will ofChrist to man, even since he entered upon his state of exaltation. Itis the will of Christ that his people should be a cheerful, joyfulpeople, and his resurrection furnishes abundant matter for joy. Be notafraid. Christ rose from the dead, to silence his people's fears, andthere is enough in that to silence them. The disciples had just beforeshamefully deserted him in his sufferings; but, to show that he couldforgive, and to teach us to do so, he calls them brethren.Notwithstanding his majesty and purity, and our meanness andunworthiness, he still condescends to call believers his brethren.
Mat 28:11-15	<br>What wickedness is it which men will not be brought to by the love ofmoney! Here was large money given to the soldiers for advancing thatwhich they knew to be a lie, yet many grudge a little money foradvancing what they know to be the truth. Let us never starve a goodcause, when we see bad ones so liberally supported. The priestsundertook to secure them from the sword of Pilate, but could not securethese soldiers from the sword of God's justice, which hangs over theheads of those that love and make a lie. Those men promise more thanthey can perform, who undertake to save a man harmless in doing awilful sin. But this falsehood disproved itself. Had the soldiers beenall asleep, they could not have known what passed. If any had beenawake, they would have roused the others and prevented the removal; andcertainly if they had been asleep, they never would have dared toconfess it; while the Jewish rulers would have been the first to callfor their punishment. Again, had there been any truth in the report,the rulers would have prosecuted the apostles with severity for it. Thewhole shows that the story was entirely false. And we must not chargesuch things to the weakness of the understanding, but to the wickednessof the heart. God left them to expose their own course. The greatargument to prove Christ to be the Son of God, is his resurrection; andnone could have more convincing proofs of the truth of that than thesesoldiers; yet they took bribes to hinder others from believing. Theplainest evidence will not affect men, without the work of the HolySpirit.
Mat 28:16-20	<br>This evangelist passes over other appearances of Christ, recorded byLuke and John, and hastens to the most solemn; one appointed before hisdeath, and after his resurrection. All that see the Lord Jesus with aneye of faith, will worship him. Yet the faith of the sincere may bevery weak and wavering. But Christ gave such convincing proofs of hisresurrection, as made their faith to triumph over doubts. He nowsolemnly commissioned the apostles and his ministers to go forth amongall nations. The salvation they were to preach, is a common salvation;whoever will, let him come, and take the benefit; all are welcome toChrist Jesus. Christianity is the religion of a sinner who applies forsalvation from deserved wrath and from sin; he applies to the mercy ofthe Father, through the atonement of the incarnate Son, and by thesanctification of the Holy Spirit, and gives up himself to be theworshipper and servant of God, as the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost,three Persons but one God, in all his ordinances and commandments.Baptism is an outward sign of that inward washing, or sanctification ofthe Spirit, which seals and evidences the believer's justification. Letus examine ourselves, whether we really possess the inward andspiritual grace of a death unto sin, and a new birth untorighteousness, by which those who were the children of wrath become thechildren of God. Believers shall have the constant presence of theirLord always; all days, every day. There is no day, no hour of the day,in which our Lord Jesus is not present with his churches and with hisministers; if there were, in that day, that hour, they would be undone.The God of Israel, the Saviour, is sometimes a God that hideth himself,but never a God at a distance. To these precious words Amen is added.Even so, Lord Jesus, be thou with us and all thy people; cause thy faceto shine upon us, that thy way may be known upon earth, thy savinghealth among all nations.
Mar 1:1-8	<br>Isaiah and Malachi each spake concerning the beginning of the gospel ofJesus Christ, in the ministry of John. From these prophets we mayobserve, that Christ, in his gospel, comes among us, bringing with hima treasure of grace, and a sceptre of government. Such is thecorruption of the world, that there is great opposition to hisprogress. When God sent his Son into the world, he took care, and whenhe sends him into the heart, he takes care, to prepare his way beforehim. John thinks himself unworthy of the meanest office about Christ.The most eminent saints have always been the most humble. They feeltheir need of Christ's atoning blood and sanctifying Spirit, more thanothers. The great promise Christ makes in his gospel to those who haverepented, and have had their sins forgiven them, is, they shall bebaptized with the Holy Ghost; shall be purified by his graces, andrefreshed by his comforts. We use the ordinances, word, and sacramentswithout profit and comfort, for the most part, because we have not ofthat Divine light within us; and we have it not because we ask it not;for we have his word that cannot fail, that our heavenly Father willgive this light, his Holy Spirit, to those that ask it.
Mar 1:9-13	<br>Christ's baptism was his first public appearance, after he had longlived unknown. How much hidden worth is there, which in this world isnot known! But sooner or later it shall be known, as Christ was. Hetook upon himself the likeness of sinful flesh; and thus, for oursakes, he sanctified himself, that we also might be sanctified, and bebaptized with him, Joh 17:19. See how honourably God owned him, when hesubmitted to John's baptism. He saw the Spirit descending upon him likea dove. We may see heaven opened to us, when we perceive the Spiritdescending and working upon us. God's good work in us, is sure evidenceof his good will towards us, and preparations for us. As to Christ'stemptation, Mark notices his being in the wilderness and that he waswith the wild beasts. It was an instance of his Father's care of him,which encouraged him the more that his Father would provide for him.Special protections are earnests of seasonable supplies. The serpenttempted the first Adam in the garden, the Second Adam in thewilderness; with different success indeed; and ever since he stilltempts the children of both, in all places and conditions. Company andconversation have their temptations; and being alone, even in awilderness, has its own also. No place or state exempts, no business,not lawful labouring, eating, or drinking, not even fasting andpraying; often in these duties there are the most assaults, but in themis the sweetest victory. The ministration of the good angels is matterof great comfort in reference to the malignant designs of the evilangels; but much more does it comfort us, to have the indwelling of Godthe Holy Spirit in our hearts.
Mar 1:14-22	<br>Jesus began to preach in Galilee, after that John was put in prison. Ifsome be laid aside, others shall be raised up, to carry on the samework. Observe the great truths Christ preached. By repentance we giveglory to our Creator whom we have offended; by faith we give glory toour Redeemer who came to save us from our sins. Christ has joined thesetwo together, and let no man think to put them asunder. Christ putshonour upon those who, though mean in this world, are diligent in theirbusiness and kind to one another. Industry and unity are good andpleasant, and the Lord Jesus commands a blessing on them. Those whomChrist calls, must leave all to follow him; and by his grace he makesthem willing to do so. Not that we must needs go out of the world, butwe must sit loose to the world; forsake every thing that is against ourduty to Christ, and that cannot be kept without hurt to our souls.Jesus strictly kept the sabbath day, by applying himself unto, andabounding in the sabbath work, in order to which the sabbath rest wasappointed. There is much in the doctrine of Christ that is astonishing;and the more we hear it, the more cause we see to admire it.
Mar 1:23-28	<br>The devil is an unclean spirit, because he has lost all the purity ofhis nature, because he acts in direct opposition to the Holy Spirit ofGod, and by his suggestions defiles the spirits of men. There are manyin our assemblies who quietly attend under merely formal teachers; butif the Lord come with faithful ministers and holy doctrine, and by hisconvincing Spirit, they are ready to say, like this man, What have weto do with thee, Jesus of Nazareth! No disorder could enable a man toknow Jesus to be the Holy One of God. He desires to have nothing to dowith Jesus, for he despairs of being saved by him, and dreads beingdestroyed by him. See whose language those speak, that say to theAlmighty, Depart from us. This unclean spirit hated and dreaded Christ,because he knew him to be a Holy One; for the carnal mind is enmityagainst God, especially against his holiness. When Christ by his gracedelivers souls out of the hands of Satan, it is not without tumult inthe soul; for that spiteful enemy will disquiet those whom he cannotdestroy. This put all who saw it upon considering, What is this newdoctrine? A work as great often is wrought now, yet men treat it withcontempt and neglect. If this were not so, the conversion of anotorious wicked man to a sober, righteous, and godly life, by thepreaching of a crucified Saviour, would cause many to ask, Whatdoctrine is this?
Mar 1:29-39	<br>Wherever Christ comes, he comes to do good. He cures, that we mayminister to him, and to others who are his, and for his sake. Thosekept from public ordinances by sickness or other real hinderances, mayexpect the Saviour's gracious presence; he will soothe their sorrows,and abate their pains. Observe how numerous the patients were. Whenothers speed well with Christ, it should quicken us in seeking afterhim. Christ departed into a solitary place. Though he was in no dangerof distraction, or of temptation to vain-glory, yet he retired. Thosewho have the most business in public, and of the best kind, must yetsometimes be alone with God.
Mar 1:40-45	<br>We have here Christ's cleansing of a leper. It teaches us to apply tothe Saviour with great humility, and with full submission to his will,saying, "Lord, if thou wilt," without any doubt of Christ's readinessto help the distressed. See also what to expect from Christ; thataccording to our faith it shall be to us. The poor leper said, If thouwilt. Christ readily wills favours to those who readily referthemselves to his will. Christ would have nothing done that looked likeseeking praise of the people. But no reasons now exist why we shouldhesitate to spread the praises of Christ.
Mar 2:1-12	<br>It was this man's misery that he needed to be so carried, and shows thesuffering state of human life; it was kind of those who so carried him,and teaches the compassion that should be in men, toward theirfellow-creatures in distress. True faith and strong faith may work invarious ways; but it shall be accepted and approved by Jesus Christ.Sin is the cause of all our pains and sicknesses. The way to remove theeffect, is to take away the cause. Pardon of sin strikes at the root ofall diseases. Christ proved his power to forgive sin, by showing hispower to cure the man sick of the palsy. And his curing diseases was afigure of his pardoning sin, for sin is the disease of the soul; whenit is pardoned, it is healed. When we see what Christ does in healingsouls, we must own that we never saw the like. Most men thinkthemselves whole; they feel no need of a physician, therefore despiseor neglect Christ and his gospel. But the convinced, humbled sinner,who despairs of all help, excepting from the Saviour, will show hisfaith by applying to him without delay.
Mar 2:13-17	<br>Matthew was not a good character, or else, being a Jew, he would neverhave been a publican, that is, a tax-gatherer for the Romans. However,Christ called this publican to follow him. With God, through Christ,there is mercy to pardon the greatest sins, and grace to change thegreatest sinners, and make them holy. A faithful, fair-dealing publicanwas rare. And because the Jews had a particular hatred to an officewhich proved that they were subject to the Romans, they gave thesetax-gatherers an ill name. But such as these our blessed Lord did nothesitate to converse with, when he appeared in the likeness of sinfulflesh. And it is no new thing for that which is both well done and welldesigned, to be slandered, and turned to the reproach of the wisest andbest of men. Christ would not withdraw, though the Pharisees wereoffended. If the world had been righteous, there had been no occasionfor his coming, either to preach repentance, or to purchaseforgiveness. We must not keep company with ungodly men out of love totheir vain conversation; but we are to show love to their souls,remembering that our good Physician had the power of healing inhimself, and was in no danger of taking the disease; but it is not sowith us. In trying to do good to others, let us be careful we do notget harm to ourselves.
Mar 2:18-22	<br>Strict professors are apt to blame all that do not fully come up totheir own views. Christ did not escape slanders; we should be willingto bear them, as well as careful not to deserve them; but should attendto every part of our duty in its proper order and season.
Mar 2:23-28	<br>The sabbath is a sacred and Divine institution; a privilege andbenefit, not a task and drudgery. God never designed it to be a burdento us, therefore we must not make it so to ourselves. The sabbath wasinstituted for the good of mankind, as living in society, having manywants and troubles, preparing for a state of happiness or misery. Manwas not made for the sabbath, as if his keeping it could be of serviceto God, nor was he commanded to keep it outward observances to his realhurt. Every observance respecting it, is to be interpreted by the ruleof mercy.
Mar 3:1-5	<br>This man's case was piteous; he had a withered hand, which disabled himfrom working for his living; and those that are so, are the most properobjects of charity. Let those be helped that cannot help themselves.But stubborn infidels, when they can say nothing against the truth, yetwill not yield. We hear what is said amiss, and see what is done amiss;but Christ looks at the root of bitterness in the heart, the blindnessand hardness of that, and is grieved. Let hard-hearted sinners trembleto think of the anger with which he will look upon them shortly, whenthe day of his wrath comes. The great healing day now is the sabbath,and the healing place the house of prayer; but the healing power is ofChrist. The gospel command is like that recorded here: though our handsare withered, yet, if we will not stretch them out, it is our own faultthat we are not healed. But if we are healed, Christ, his power andgrace, must have all the glory.
Mar 3:6-12	<br>All our sicknesses and calamities spring from the anger of God againstour sins. Their removal, or the making them blessings to us, waspurchased to us by the blood of Christ. But the plagues and diseases ofour souls, of our hearts, are chiefly to be dreaded; and He can healthem also by a word. May more and more press to Christ to be healed ofthese plagues, and to be delivered from the enemies of their souls.
Mar 3:13-21	<br>Christ calls whom he will; for his grace is his own. He had called theapostles to separate themselves from the crowd, and they came unto him.He now gave them power to heal sicknesses, and to cast out devils. Maythe Lord send forth more and more of those who have been with him, andhave learned of him to preach his gospel, to be instruments in hisblessed work. Those whose hearts are enlarged in the work of God, caneasily bear with what is inconvenient to themselves, and will ratherlose a meal than an opportunity of doing good. Those who go on withzeal in the work of God, must expect hinderances, both from the hatredof enemies, and mistaken affections of friends, and need to guardagainst both.
Mar 3:22-30	<br>It was plain that the doctrine of Christ had a direct tendency to breakthe devil's power; and it was as plain, that casting of him out of thebodies of people, confirmed that doctrine; therefore Satan could notsupport such a design. Christ gave an awful warning against speakingsuch dangerous words. It is true the gospel promises, because Christhas purchased, forgiveness for the greatest sins and sinners; but bythis sin, they would oppose the gifts of the Holy Ghost after Christ'sascension. Such is the enmity of the heart, that unconverted menpretend believers are doing Satan's work, when sinners are brought torepentance and newness of life.
Mar 3:31-35	<br>It is a great comfort to all true Christians, that they are dearer toChrist than mother, brother, or sister as such, merely as relations inthe flesh would have been, even had they been holy. Blessed be God,this great and gracious privilege is ours even now; for though Christ'sbodily presence cannot be enjoyed by us, his spiritual presence is notdenied us.
Mar 4:1-20	<br>This parable contained instruction so important, that all capable ofhearing were bound to attend to it. There are many things we areconcerned to know; and if we understand not the plain truths of thegospel, how shall we learn those more difficult! It will help us tovalue the privileges we enjoy as disciples of Christ, if we seriouslyconsider the deplorable state of all who have not such privileges. Inthe great field of the church, the word of God is dispensed to all. Ofthe many that hear the word of the gospel, but few receive it, so as tobring forth fruit. Many are much affected with the word for thepresent, who yet receive no abiding benefit. The word does not leaveabiding impressions upon the minds of men, because their hearts are notduly disposed to receive it. The devil is very busy about carelesshearers, as the fowls of the air go about the seed that lies aboveground. Many continue in a barren, false profession, and go down tohell. Impressions that are not deep, will not last. Many do not mindheart-work, without which religion is nothing. Others are hindered fromprofiting by the word of God, by abundance of the world. And those whohave but little of the world, may yet be ruined by indulging the body.God expects and requires fruit from those who enjoy the gospel, atemper of mind and Christian graces daily exercised, Christian dutiesduly performed. Let us look to the Lord, that by his new-creating graceour hearts may become good ground, and that the good seed of the wordmay produce in our lives those good words and works which are throughJesus Christ, to the praise and glory of God the Father.
Mar 4:21-34	<br>These declarations were intended to call the attention of the disciplesto the word of Christ. By his thus instructing them, they were madeable to instruct others; as candles are lighted, not to be covered, butto be placed on a candlestick, that they may give light to a room. Thisparable of the good seed, shows the manner in which the kingdom of Godmakes progress in the world. Let but the word of Christ have the placeit ought to have in a soul, and it will show itself in a goodconversation. It grows gradually: first the blade; then the ear; afterthat the full corn in the ear. When it is sprung up, it will goforward. The work of grace in the soul is, at first, but the day ofsmall things; yet it has mighty products even now, while it is in itsgrowth; but what will there be when it is perfected in heaven!
Mar 4:35-41	<br>Christ was asleep in the storm, to try the faith of his disciples, andto stir them up to pray. Their faith appeared weak, and their prayersstrong. When our wicked hearts are like the troubled sea which cannotrest, when our passions are unruly, let us think we hear the law ofChrist, saying, Be silent, be dumb. When without are fightings, andwithin are fears, and the spirits are in a tumult, if he say, "Peace,be still," there is a great calm at once. Why are ye so fearful? Thoughthere may be cause for some fear, yet not for such fear as this. Thosemay suspect their faith, who can have such a thought as that Jesuscareth not though his people perish. How imperfect are the best ofsaints! Faith and fear take their turns while we are in this world; butere long, fear will be overcome, and faith will be lost in sight.
Mar 5:1-20	<br>Some openly wilful sinners are like this madman. The commands of thelaw are as chains and fetters, to restrain sinners from their wickedcourses; but they break those bands in sunder; and it is an evidence ofthe power of the devil in them. A legion of soldiers consisted of sixthousand men, or more. What multitudes of fallen spirits there must be,and all enemies to God and man, when here was a legion in one poorwretched creature! Many there are that rise up against us. We are not amatch for our spiritual enemies, in our own strength; but in the Lord,and in the power of his might, we shall be able to stand against them,though there are legions of them. When the vilest transgressor isdelivered by the power of Jesus from the bondage of Satan, he willgladly sit at the feet of his Deliverer, and hear his word, whodelivers the wretched slaves of Satan, and numbers them among hissaints and servants. When the people found that their swine were lost,they had a dislike to Christ. Long-suffering and mercy may be seen,even in the corrections by which men lose their property while theirlives are saved, and warning given them to seek the salvation of theirsouls. The man joyfully proclaimed what great things Jesus had done forhim. All men marvelled, but few followed him. Many who cannot butwonder at the works of Christ, yet do not, as they ought, wonder afterhim.
Mar 5:21-34	<br>A despised gospel will go where it will be better received. One of therulers of a synagogue earnestly besought Christ for a little daughter,about twelve years old, who was dying. Another cure was wrought by theway. We should do good, not only when in the house, but when we walk bythe way, De 6:7. It is common with people not to apply to Christ tillthey have tried in vain all other helpers, and find them, as certainlythey will, physicians of no value. Some run to diversions and gaycompany; others plunge into business, or even into intemperance; othersgo about to establish their own righteousness, or torment themselves byvain superstitions. Many perish in these ways; but none will ever findrest to the soul by such devices; while those whom Christ heals of thedisease of sin, find in themselves an entire change for the better. Assecret acts of sin, so secret acts of faith, are known to the LordJesus. The woman told all the truth. It is the will of Christ that hispeople should be comforted, and he has power to command comfort totroubled spirits. The more simply we depend on Him, and expect greatthings from him, the more we shall find in ourselves that he is becomeour salvation. Those who, by faith, are healed of their spiritualdiseases, have reason to go in peace.
Mar 5:35-43	<br>We may suppose Jairus hesitating whether he should ask Christ to go onor not, when told that his daughter was dead. But have we not as muchoccasion for the grace of God, and the comfort of his Spirit, for theprayers of our ministers and Christian friends, when death is in thehouse, as when sickness is there? Faith is the only remedy againstgrief and fear at such a time. Believe the resurrection, then fear not.He raised the dead child to life by a word of power. Such is the gospelcall to those who are by nature dead in trespasses and sins. It is bythe word of Christ that spiritual life is given. All who saw it, andheard of it, admired the miracle, and Him that wrought it. Though wecannot now expect to have our dead children or relatives restored, wemay hope to find comfort under our trials.
Mar 6:1-6	<br>Our Lord's countrymen tried to prejudice the minds of people againsthim. Is not this the carpenter? Our Lord Jesus probably had worked inthat business with his father. He thus put honour upon mechanics, andencouraged all persons who eat by the labour of their hands. It becomesthe followers of Christ to content themselves with the satisfaction ofdoing good, although they are denied the praise of it. How much didthese Nazarenes lose by obstinate prejudices against Jesus! May Divinegrace deliver us from that unbelief, which renders Christ a savour ofdeath, rather than of life to the soul. Let us, like our Master, go andteach cottages and peasants the way of salvation.
Mar 6:7-13	<br>Though the apostles were conscious to themselves of great weakness, andexpected no wordly advantage, yet, in obedience to their Master, and independence upon his strength, they went out. They did not amuse peoplewith curious matters, but told them they must repent of their sins, andturn to God. The servants of Christ may hope to turn many from darknessunto God, and to heal souls by the power of the Holy Ghost.
Mar 6:14-29	<br>Herod feared John while he lived, and feared him still more when he wasdead. Herod did many of those things which John in his preaching taughthim; but it is not enough to do many things, we must have respect toall the commandments. Herod respected John, till he touched him in hisHerodias. Thus many love good preaching, if it keep far away from theirbeloved sin. But it is better that sinners persecute ministers now forfaithfulness, than curse them eternally for unfaithfulness. The ways ofGod are unsearchable; but we may be sure he never can be at a loss torepay his servants for what they endure or lose for his sake. Deathcould not come so as to surprise this holy man; and the triumph of thewicked was short.
Mar 6:30-44	<br>Let not ministers do any thing or teach any thing, but what they arewilling should be told to their Lord. Christ notices the frights ofsome, and the toils of others of his disciples, and provides rest forthose that are tired, and refuge for those that are terrified. Thepeople sought the spiritual food of Christ's word, and then he tookcare that they should not want bodily food. If Christ and his disciplesput up with mean things, surely we may. And this miracle shows thatChrist came into the world, not only to restore, but to preserve andnourish spiritual life; in him there is enough for all that come. Noneare sent empty away from Christ but those who come to him full ofthemselves. Though Christ had bread enough at command, he teaches usnot to waste any of God's bounties, remembering how many are in want.We may, some time, need the fragments that we now throw away.
Mar 6:45-56	<br>The church is often like a ship at sea, tossed with tempests, and notcomforted: we may have Christ for us, yet wind and tide against us; butit is a comfort to Christ's disciples in a storm, that their Master isin the heavenly mount, interceding for them. And no difficulties canhinder Christ's appearance for his people, when the set time is come.He silenced their fears, by making himself known to them. Our fears aresoon satisfied, if our mistakes are set right, especially our mistakesas to Christ. Let the disciples have their Master with them, and all iswell. It is for want of rightly understanding Christ's former works,that we view his present works as if there never were the like before.If Christ's ministers now could cure people's bodily diseases, whatmultitudes would flock after them! It is sad to think how much moremost care about their bodies than about their souls.
Mar 7:1-13	<br>One great design of Christ's coming was, to set aside the ceremoniallaw; and to make way for this, he rejects the ceremonies men added tothe law of God's making. Those clean hands and that pure heart whichChrist bestows on his disciples, and requires of them, are verydifferent from the outward and superstitious forms of Pharisees ofevery age. Jesus reproves them for rejecting the commandment of God. Itis clear that it is the duty of children, if their parents are poor, torelieve them as far as they are able; and if children deserve to diethat curse their parents, much more those that starve them. But if aman conformed to the traditions of the Pharisees, they found a deviceto free him from the claim of this duty.
Mar 7:14-23	<br>Our wicked thoughts and affections, words and actions, defile us, andthese only. As a corrupt fountain sends forth corrupt streams, so doesa corrupt heart send forth corrupt reasonings, corrupt appetites andpassions, and all the wicked words and actions that come from them. Aspiritual understanding of the law of God, and a sense of the evil ofsin, will cause a man to seek for the grace of the Holy Spirit, to keepdown the evil thoughts and affections that work within.
Mar 7:24-30	<br>Christ never put any from him that fell at his feet, which a poortrembling soul may do. As she was a good woman, so a good mother. Thissent her to Christ. His saying, Let the children first be filled, showsthat there was mercy for the Gentiles, and not far off. She spoke, notas making light of the mercy, but magnifying the abundance ofmiraculous cures among the Jews, in comparison with which a single curewas but as a crumb. Thus, while proud Pharisees are left by the blessedSaviour, he manifests his compassion to poor humbled sinners, who lookto him for children's bread. He still goes about to seek and save thelost.
Mar 7:31-37	<br>Here is a cure of one that was deaf and dumb. Those who brought thispoor man to Christ, besought him to observe the case, and put forth hispower. Our Lord used more outward actions in the doing of this curethan usual. These were only signs of Christ's power to cure the man, toencourage his faith, and theirs that brought him. Though we find greatvariety in the cases and manner of relief of those who applied toChrist, yet all obtained the relief they sought. Thus it still is inthe great concerns of our souls.
Mar 8:1-10	<br>Our Lord Jesus encouraged the meanest to come to him for life andgrace. Christ knows and considers our frames. The bounty of Christ isalways ready; to show that, he repeated this miracle. His favours arerenewed, as our wants and necessities are. And those need not fearwant, who have Christ to live upon by faith, and do so withthanksgiving.
Mar 8:11-21	<br>Obstinate unbelief will have something to say, though ever sounreasonable. Christ refused to answer their demand. If they will notbe convinced, they shall not. Alas! what cause we have to lament forthose around us, who destroy themselves and others by their perverseand obstinate unbelief, and enmity to the gospel! When we forget theworks of God, and distrust him, we should chide ourselves severely, asChrist here reproves his disciples. How is it that we so often mistakehis meaning, disregard his warnings, and distrust his providence?
Mar 8:22-26	<br>Here is a blind man brought to Christ by his friends. Therein appearedthe faith of those that brought him. If those who are spirituallyblind, do not pray for themselves, yet their friends and relationsshould pray for them, that Christ would be pleased to touch them. Thecure was wrought gradually, which was not usual in our Lord's miracles.Christ showed in what method those commonly are healed by his grace,who by nature are spiritually blind. At first, their knowledge isconfused; but, like the light of the morning, it shines more and moreto the perfect day, and then they see all things clearly. SlightingChrist's favours is forfeiting them; and he will make those who do soknow the worth of privileges by the want of them.
Mar 8:27-33	<br>These things are written, that we may believe that Jesus is the Christ,the Son of God. These miracles of our Lord assure us that he was notconquered, but a Conqueror. Now the disciples are convinced that Jesusis the Christ; they may bear to hear of his sufferings, of which Christhere begins to give them notice. He sees that amiss in what we say anddo, of which we ourselves are not aware, and knows what manner ofspirit we are of, when we ourselves do not. The wisdom of man is folly,when it pretends to limit the Divine counsels. Peter did not rightlyunderstand the nature of Christ's kingdom.
Mar 8:34-38	<br>Frequent notice is taken of the great flocking there was to Christ forhelp in various cases. All are concerned to know this, if they expecthim to heal their souls. They must not indulge the ease of the body. Asthe happiness of heaven with Christ, is enough to make up for the lossof life itself for him, so the gain of all the world in sin, will notmake up for the ruin of the soul by sin. And there is a day coming,when the cause of Christ will appear as glorious, as some now think itmean and contemptible. May we think of that season, and view everyearthly object as we shall do at that great day.
Mar 9:1-13	<br>Here is a prediction of the near approach Christ's kingdom. A glimpseof that kingdom was given in the transfiguration of Christ. It is goodto be away from the world, and alone with Christ: and how good to bewith Christ glorified in heaven with all the saints! But when it iswell with us, we are apt not to care for others, and in the fulness ofour enjoyments, we forget the many wants of our brethren. God ownsJesus, and accepts him as his beloved Son, and is ready to accept us inhim. Therefore we must own and accept him as our beloved Saviour, andmust give up ourselves to be ruled by him. Christ does not leave thesoul, when joys and comforts leave it. Jesus explained to the disciplesthe prophecy about Elias. This was very suitable to the ill usage ofJohn Baptist.
Mar 9:14-29	<br>The father of the suffering youth reflected on the want of power in thedisciples; but Christ will have him reckon the disappointment to thewant of faith. Very much is promised to our believing. If thou canstbelieve, it is possible that thy hard heart may be softened, thyspiritual diseases may be cured; and, weak as thou art, thou mayest beable to hold out to the end. Those that complain of unbelief, must lookup to Christ for grace to help them against it, and his grace will besufficient for them. Whom Christ cures, he cures effectually. But Satanis unwilling to be driven from those that have been long his slaves,and, when he cannot deceive or destroy the sinner, he will cause himall the terror that he can. The disciples must not think to do theirwork always with the same ease; some services call for more thanordinary pains.
Mar 9:30-40	<br>The time of Christ's suffering drew nigh. Had he been delivered intothe hands of devils, and they had done this, it had not been sostrange; but that men should thus shamefully treat the Son of man, whocame to redeem and save them, is wonderful. Still observe that whenChrist spake of his death, he always spake of his resurrection, whichtook the reproach of it from himself, and should have taken the griefof it from his disciples. Many remain ignorant because they are ashamedto inquire. Alas! that while the Saviour teaches so plainly the thingswhich belong to his love and grace, men are so blinded that theyunderstand not his sayings. We shall be called to account about ourdiscourses, and to account for our disputes, especially about beinggreater than others. Those who are most humble and self-denying, mostresemble Christ, and shall be most tenderly owned by him. This Jesustaught them by a sign; whoever shall receive one like this child,receives me. Many have been like the disciples, ready to silence menwho have success in preaching to sinners repentance in Christ's name,because they follow not with them. Our Lord blamed the apostles,reminding them that he who wrought miracles in his name would not belikely to hurt his cause. If sinners are brought to repent, to believein the Saviour, and to live sober, righteous, and godly lives, we thensee that the Lord works by the preacher.
Mar 9:41-50	<br>It is repeatedly said of the wicked, Their worm dieth not, as well as,The fire is never quenched. Doubtless, remorse of conscience and keenself-reflection are this never-dying worm. Surely it is beyond comparebetter to undergo all possible pain, hardship, and self-denial here,and to be happy for ever hereafter, than to enjoy all kinds of worldlypleasure for a season, and to be miserable for ever. Like thesacrifices, we must be salted with salt; our corrupt affections must besubdued and mortified by the Holy Spirit. Those that have the salt ofgrace, must show they have a living principle of grace in their hearts,which works out corrupt dispositions in the soul that would offend God,or our own consciences.
Mar 10:1-12	<br>Wherever Jesus was, the people flocked after him in crowds, and hetaught them. Preaching was Christ's constant practice. He here showsthat the reason why Moses' law allowed divorce, was such that theyought not to use the permission; it was only for the hardness of theirhearts. God himself joined man and wife together; he has fitted them tobe comforts and helps for each other. The bond which God has tied, isnot to be lightly untied. Let those who are for putting away theirwives consider what would become of themselves, if God should deal withthem in like manner.
Mar 10:13-16	<br>Some parents or nurses brought little children to Christ, that heshould touch them, in token of his blessing them. It does not appearthat they needed bodily cures, nor were they capable of being taught:but those who had the care of them believed that Christ's blessingwould do their souls good; therefore they brought them to him. Jesusordered that they should be brought to him, and that nothing should besaid or done to hinder it. Children should be directed to the Saviouras soon as they are able to understand his words. Also, we must receivethe kingdom of God as little children; we must stand affected to Christand his grace, as little children to their parents, nurses, andteachers.
Mar 10:17-22	<br>This young ruler showed great earnestness. He asked what he should donow, that he might be happy for ever. Most ask for good to be had inthis world; any good, Ps 4:6; he asks for good to be done in thisworld, in order to enjoy the greatest good in the other world. Christencouraged this address by assisting his faith, and by directing hispractice. But here is a sorrowful parting between Jesus and this youngman. He asks Christ what he shall do more than he has done, to obtaineternal life; and Christ puts it to him, whether he has indeed thatfirm belief of, and that high value for eternal life which he seems tohave. Is he willing to bear a present cross, in expectation of futurecrown? The young man was sorry he could not be a follower of Christupon easier terms; that he could not lay hold on eternal life, and keephold of his worldly possessions too. He went away grieved. See Mt 6:24,Ye cannot serve God and mammon.
Mar 10:23-31	<br>Christ took this occasion to speak to his disciples about thedifficulty of the salvation of those who have abundance of this world.Those who thus eagerly seek the wealth of the world, will never rightlyprize Christ and his grace. Also, as to the greatness of the salvationof those who have but little of this world, and leave it for Christ.The greatest trial of a good man's constancy is, when love to Jesuscalls him to give up love to friends and relatives. Even when gainersby Christ, let them still expect to suffer for him, till they reachheaven. Let us learn contentment in a low state, and to watch againstthe love of riches in a high one. Let us pray to be enabled to partwith all, if required, in Christ's service, and to use all we areallowed to keep in his service.
Mar 10:32-45	<br>Christ's going on with his undertaking for the salvation of mankind,was, is, and will be, the wonder of all his disciples. Worldly honouris a glittering thing, with which the eyes of Christ's own discipleshave many times been dazzled. Our care must be, that we may have wisdomand grace to know how to suffer with him; and we may trust him toprovide what the degrees of our glory shall be. Christ shows them thatdominion was generally abused in the world. If Jesus would gratify allour desires, it would soon appear that we desire fame or authority, andare unwilling to taste of his cup, or to have his baptism; and shouldoften be ruined by having our prayers answered. But he loves us, andwill only give his people what is good for them.
Mar 10:46-52	<br>Bartimeus had heard of Jesus and his miracles, and learning that he waspassing by, hoped to recover his eyesight. In coming to Christ for helpand healing, we should look to him as the promised Messiah. Thegracious calls Christ gives us to come to him, encourage our hope, thatif we come to him we shall have what we come for. Those who would cometo Jesus, must cast away the garment of their own sufficiency, mustfree themselves from every weight, and the sin that, like longgarments, most easily besets them, Heb 12:1. He begged that his eyesmight be opened. It is very desirable to be able to earn our bread; andwhere God has given men limbs and senses, it is a shame, by foolishnessand slothfulness, to make themselves, in effect, blind and lame. Hiseyes were opened. Thy faith has made thee whole: faith in Christ as theSon of David, and in his pity and power; not thy repeated words, butthy faith; Christ setting thy faith to work. Let sinners be exhorted toimitate blind Bartimeus. Where the gospel is preached, or the writtenwords of truth circulated, Jesus is passing by, and this is theopportunity. It is not enough to come to Christ for spiritual healing,but, when we are healed, we must continue to follow him; that we mayhonour him, and receive instruction from him. Those who have spiritualeyesight, see that beauty in Christ which will draw them to run afterhim.
Mar 11:1-11	<br>Christ's coming into Jerusalem thus remarkably, shows that he was notafraid of the power and malice of his enemies. This would encourage hisdisciples who were full of fear. Also, that he was not disquieted atthe thoughts of his approaching sufferings. But all marked hishumiliation; and these matters teach us not to mind high things, but tocondescend to those of low estate. How ill it becomes Christians totake state, when Christ was so far from claiming it! They welcomed hisperson; Blessed is he that cometh, the "He that should come," so oftenpromised, so long expected; he comes in the name of the Lord. Let himhave our best affections; he is a blessed Saviour, and brings blessingsto us, and blessed be He that sent him. Praises be to our God, who isin the highest heavens, over all, God blessed for ever.
Mar 11:12-18	<br>Christ looked to find some fruit, for the time of gathering figs,though it was near, was not yet come; but he found none. He made thisfig-tree an example, not to the trees, but to the men of thatgeneration. It was a figure of the doom upon the Jewish church, towhich he came seeking fruit, but found none. Christ went to the temple,and began to reform the abuses in its courts, to show that when theRedeemer came to Zion, it was to turn away ungodliness from Jacob. Thescribes and the chief priests sought, not how they might make theirpeace with him, but how they might destroy him. A desperate attempt,which they could not but fear was fighting against God.
Mar 11:19-26	<br>The disciples could not think why that fig-tree should so soon witheraway; but all wither who reject Christ; it represented the state of theJewish church. We should rest in no religion that does not make usfruitful in good works. Christ taught them from hence to pray in faith.It may be applied to that mighty faith with which all true Christiansare endued, and which does wonders in spiritual things. It justifiesus, and so removes mountains of guilt, never to rise up in judgmentagainst us. It purifies the heart, and so removes mountains ofcorruption, and makes them plain before the grace of God. One greaterrand to the throne of grace is to pray for the pardon of our sins;and care about this ought to be our daily concern.
Mar 11:27-33	<br>Our Saviour shows how near akin his doctrine and baptism were to thoseof John; they had the same design and tendency, to bring in the gospelkingdom. These elders did not deserve to be taught; for it was plainthat they contended not for truth, but victory: nor did he need to tellthem; for the works he did, told them plainly he had authority fromGod; since no man could do the miracles which he did, unless God werewith him.
Mar 12:1-12	<br>Christ showed in parables, that he would lay aside the Jewish church.It is sad to think what base usage God's faithful ministers have metwith in all ages, from those who have enjoyed the privileges of thechurch, but have not brought forth fruit answerable. God at length senthis Son, his Well-beloved; and it might be expected that he whom theirMaster loved, they also should respect and love; but instead ofhonouring him because he was the Son and Heir, they therefore hatedhim. But the exaltation of Christ was the Lord's doing; and it is hisdoing to exalt him in our hearts, and to set up his throne there; andif this be done, it cannot but be marvellous in our eyes. TheScriptures, and faithful preachers, and the coming of Christ in theflesh, call on us to render due praise to God in our lives. Let sinnersbeware of a proud, carnal spirit; if they revile or despise thepreachers of Christ, they would have done so their Master, had theylived when he was upon earth.
Mar 12:13-17	<br>The enemies of Christ would be thought desirous to know their duty,when really they hoped that which soever side he took of the question,they might find occasion to accuse him. Nothing is more likely toinsnare the followers of Christ, than bringing them to meddle withdisputes about worldly politics. Jesus avoided the snare, by referringto the submission they had already made as a nation; and all that heardhim, marvelled at the great wisdom of his answer. Many will praise thewords of a sermon, who will not be commanded by the doctrines of it.
Mar 12:18-27	<br>A right knowledge of the Scripture, as the fountain whence all revealedreligion now flows, and the foundation on which it is built, is thebest preservative against error. Christ put aside the objection of theSadducees, who were the scoffing infidels of that day, by setting thedoctrine of the future state in a true light. The relation betweenhusband and wife, though appointed in the earthly paradise, will not beknown in the heavenly one. It is no wonder if we confuse ourselves withfoolish errors, when we form our ideas of the world of spirits by theaffairs of this world of sense. It is absurd to think that the livingGod should be the portion and happiness of a man if he is for everdead; and therefore it is certain that Abraham's soul exists and acts,though now for a time separate from the body. Those that deny theresurrection greatly err, and ought to be told so. Let us seek to passthrough this dying world, with a joyful hope of eternal happiness, andof a glorious resurrection.
Mar 12:28-34	<br>Those who sincerely desire to be taught their duty, Christ will guidein judgment, and teach his way. He tells the scribe that the greatcommandment, which indeed includes all, is, that of loving God with allour hearts. Wherever this is the ruling principle in the soul, there isa disposition to every other duty. Loving God with all our heart, willengage us to every thing by which he will be pleased. The sacrificesonly represented the atonements for men's transgressions of the morallaw; they were of no power except as they expressed repentance andfaith in the promised Saviour, and as they led to moral obedience. Andbecause we have not thus loved God and man, but the very reverse,therefore we are condemned sinners; we need repentance, and we needmercy. Christ approved what the scribe said, and encouraged him. Hestood fair for further advance; for this knowledge of the law leads toconviction of sin, to repentance, to discovery of our need of mercy,and understanding the way of justification by Christ.
Mar 12:35-40	<br>When we attend to what the Scriptures declare, as to the person andoffices of Christ, we shall be led to confess him as our Lord and God;to obey him as our exalted Redeemer. If the common people hear thesethings gladly, while the learned and distinguished oppose, the formerare happy, and the latter to be pitied. And as sin, disguised with ashow of piety, is double iniquity, so its doom will be doubly heavy.
Mar 12:41-44	<br>Let us not forget that Jesus still sees the treasury. He knows howmuch, and from what motives, men give to his cause. He looks at theheart, and what our views are, in giving alms; and whether we do it asunto the Lord, or only to be seen of men. It is so rare to find any whowould not blame this widow, that we cannot expect to find many who willdo like to her; and yet our Saviour commends her, therefore we are surethat she did well and wisely. The feeble efforts of the poor to honourtheir Saviour, will be commended in that day, when the splendid actionsof unbelievers will be exposed to contempt.
Mar 13:1-4	<br>See how little Christ values outward pomp, where there is not realpurity of heart. He looks with pity upon the ruin of precious souls,and weeps over them, but we do not find him look with pity upon theruin of a fine house. Let us then be reminded how needful it is for usto have a more lasting abode in heaven, and to be prepared for it bythe influences of the Holy Spirit, sought in the earnest use of all themeans of grace.
Mar 13:5-13	<br>Our Lord Jesus, in reply to the disciples' question, does not so muchsatisfy their curiosity as direct their consciences. When many aredeceived, we should thereby be awakened to look to ourselves. And thedisciples of Christ, if it be not their own fault, may enjoy holysecurity and peace of mind, when all around is in disorder. But theymust take heed that they are not drawn away from Christ and their dutyto him, by the sufferings they will meet with for his sake. They shallbe hated of all men: trouble enough! Yet the work they were called toshould be carried on and prosper. Though they may be crushed and bornedown, the gospel cannot be. The salvation promised is more thandeliverance from evil, it is everlasting blessedness.
Mar 13:14-23	<br>The Jews in rebelling against the Romans, and in persecuting theChristians, hastened their own ruin apace. Here we have a prediction ofthat ruin which came upon them within less than forty years after this.Such destruction and desolation, that the like cannot be found in anyhistory. Promises of power to persevere, and cautions against fallingaway, well agree with each other. But the more we consider thesethings, the more we shall see abundant cause to flee without delay forrefuge to Christ, and to renounce every earthly object, for thesalvation of our souls.
Mar 13:24-27	<br>The disciples had confounded the destruction of Jerusalem and the endof the world. This mistake Christ set right, and showed that the day ofChrist's coming, and the day of judgment, shall be after thattribulation. Here he foretells the final dissolution of the presentframe and fabric of the world. Also, the visible appearance of the LordJesus coming in the clouds, and the gathering together of all the electto him.
Mar 13:28-37	<br>We have the application of this prophetic sermon. As to the destructionof Jerusalem, expect it to come very shortly. As to the end of theworld, do not inquire when it will come, for of that day and that hourknoweth no man. Christ, as God, could not be ignorant of anything; butthe Divine wisdom which dwelt in our Saviour, communicated itself tohis human soul according to the Divine pleasure. As to both, our dutyis to watch and pray. Our Lord Jesus, when he ascended on high, leftsomething for all his servants to do. We ought to be always upon ourwatch, in expectation of his return. This applies to Christ's coming tous at our death, as well as to the general judgment. We know notwhether our Master will come in the days of youth, or middle age, orold age; but, as soon as we are born, we begin to die, and therefore wemust expect death. Our great care must be, that, whenever our Lordcomes, he may not find us secure, indulging in ease and sloth, mindlessof our work and duty. He says to all, Watch, that you may be found inpeace, without spot, and blameless.
Mar 14:1-11	<br>Did Christ pour out his soul unto death for us, and shall we think anything too precious for him? Do we give him the precious ointment of ourbest affections? Let us love him with all the heart, though it iscommon for zeal and affection to be misunderstood and blamed; andremember that charity to the poor will not excuse any from particularacts of piety to the Lord Jesus. Christ commended this woman's piousattention to the notice of believers in all ages. Those who honourChrist he will honour. Covetousness was Judas' master lust, and thatbetrayed him to the sin of betraying his Master; the devil suited histemptation to that, and so conquered him. And see what wickedcontrivances many have in their sinful pursuits; but what appears toforward their plans, will prove curses in the end.
Mar 14:12-21	<br>Nothing could be less the result of human foresight than the eventshere related. But our Lord knows all things about us before they cometo pass. If we admit him, he will dwell in our hearts. The Son of mangoes, as it is written of him, as a lamb to the slaughter; but woe tothat man by whom he is betrayed! God's permitting the sins of men, andbringing glory to himself out of them, does not oblige them to sin; norwill this be any excuse for their guilt, or lessen their punishment.
Mar 14:22-31	<br>The Lord's supper is food for the soul, therefore a very little of thatwhich is for the body, as much as will serve for a sign, is enough. Itwas instituted by the example and the practice of our Master, to remainin force till his second coming. It was instituted with blessing andgiving of thanks, to be a memorial of Christ's death. Frequent mentionis made of his precious blood, as the price of our redemption. Howcomfortable is this to poor repenting sinners, that the blood of Christis shed for many! If for many, why not for me? It was a sign of theconveyance of the benefits purchased for us by his death. Apply thedoctrine of Christ crucified to yourselves; let it be meat and drink toyour souls, strengthening and refreshing your spiritual life. It was tobe an earnest and foretaste of the happiness of heaven, and thereby toput us out of taste for the pleasures and delights of sense. Every onethat has tasted spiritual delights, straightway desires eternal ones.Though the great Shepherd passed through his sufferings without onefalse step, yet his followers often have been scattered by the smallmeasure of sufferings allotted to them. How very apt we are to thinkwell of ourselves, and to trust our own hearts! It was ill done ofPeter thus to answer his Master, and not with fear and trembling. Lord,give me grace to keep me from denying thee.
Mar 14:32-42	<br>Christ's sufferings began with the sorest of all, those in his soul. Hebegan to be sorely amazed; words not used in St. Matthew, but very fullof meaning. The terrors of God set themselves in array against him, andhe allowed him to contemplate them. Never was sorrow like unto his atthis time. Now he was made a curse for us; the curses of the law werelaid upon him as our Surety. He now tasted death, in all the bitternessof it. This was that fear of which the apostle speaks, the natural fearof pain and death, at which human nature startles. Can we everentertain favourable, or even slight thoughts of sin, when we see thepainful sufferings which sin, though but reckoned to him, brought onthe Lord Jesus? Shall that sit light upon our souls, which sat so heavyupon his? Was Christ in such agony for our sins, and shall we never bein agony about them? How should we look upon Him whom we have pierced,and mourn! It becomes us to be exceedingly sorrowful for sin, becauseHe was so, and never to mock at it. Christ, as Man, pleaded, that, ifit were possible, his sufferings might pass from him. As Mediator, hesubmitted to the will of God, saying, Nevertheless, not what I will,but what thou wilt; I bid it welcome. See how the sinful weakness ofChrist's disciples returns, and overpowers them. What heavy clogs thesebodies of ours are to our souls! But when we see trouble at the door,we should get ready for it. Alas, even believers often look at theRedeemer's sufferings in a drowsy manner, and instead of being ready todie with Christ, they are not even prepared to watch with him one hour.
Mar 14:43-52	<br>Because Christ appeared not as a temporal prince, but preachedrepentance, reformation, and a holy life, and directed men's thoughts,and affections, and aims to another world, therefore the Jewish rulerssought to destroy him. Peter wounded one of the band. It is easier tofight for Christ than to die for him. But there is a great differencebetween faulty disciples and hypocrites. The latter rashly and withoutthought call Christ Master, and express great affection for him, yetbetray him to his enemies. Thus they hasten their own destruction.
Mar 14:53-65	<br>We have here Christ's condemnation before the great council of theJews. Peter followed; but the high priest's fire-side was no properplace, nor his servants proper company, for Peter: it was an entranceinto temptation. Great diligence was used to procure false witnessesagainst Jesus, yet their testimony was not equal to the charge of acapital crime, by the utmost stretch of their law. He was asked, Artthou the Son of the Blessed? that is, the Son of God. For the proof ofhis being the Son of God, he refers to his second coming. In theseoutrages we have proofs of man's enmity to God, and of God's free andunspeakable love to man.
Mar 14:66-72	<br>Peter's denying Christ began by keeping at a distance from him. Thosethat are shy of godliness, are far in the way to deny Christ. Those whothink it dangerous to be in company with Christ's disciples, becausethence they may be drawn in to suffer for him, will find it much moredangerous to be in company with his enemies, because there they may bedrawn in to sin against him. When Christ was admired and flocked after,Peter readily owned him; but will own no relation to him now he isdeserted and despised. Yet observe, Peter's repentance was very speedy.Let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall; and let himthat has fallen think of these things, and of his own offences, andreturn to the Lord with weeping and supplication, seeking forgiveness,and to be raised up by the Holy Spirit.
Mar 15:1-14	<br>They bound Christ. It is good for us often to remember the bonds of theLord Jesus, as bound with him who was bound for us. By delivering upthe King, they, in effect, delivered up the kingdom of God, which was,therefore, as by their own consent, taken from them, and given toanother nation. Christ gave Pilate a direct answer, but would notanswer the witnesses, because the things they alleged were known to befalse, even Pilate himself was convinced they were so. Pilate thoughtthat he might appeal from the priests to the people, and that theywould deliver Jesus out of the priests' hands. But they were more andmore urged by the priests, and cried, Crucify him! Crucify him! Let usjudge of persons and things by their merits, and the standard of God'sword, and not by common report. The thought that no one ever was soshamefully treated, as the only perfectly wise, holy, and excellentPerson that ever appeared on earth, leads the serious mind to strongviews of man's wickedness and enmity to God. Let us more and more abhorthe evil dispositions which marked the conduct of these persecutors.
Mar 15:15-21	<br>Christ met death in its greatest terror. It was the death of the vilestmalefactors. Thus the cross and the shame are put together. God havingbeen dishonoured by the sin of man, Christ made satisfaction bysubmitting to the greatest disgrace human nature could be loaded with.It was a cursed death; thus it was branded by the Jewish law, De 21:23.The Roman soldiers mocked our Lord Jesus as a King; thus in the highpriest's hall the servants had mocked him as a Prophet and Saviour.Shall a purple or scarlet robe be matter of pride to a Christian, whichwas matter of reproach and shame to Christ? He wore the crown of thornswhich we deserved, that we might wear the crown of glory which hemerited. We were by sin liable to everlasting shame and contempt; todeliver us, our Lord Jesus submitted to shame and contempt. He was ledforth with the workers of iniquity, though he did no sin. Thesufferings of the meek and holy Redeemer, are ever a source ofinstruction to the believer, of which, in his best hours, he cannot beweary. Did Jesus thus suffer, and shall I, a vile sinner, fret orrepine? Shall I indulge anger, or utter reproaches and threats becauseof troubles and injuries?
Mar 15:22-32	<br>The place where our Lord Jesus was crucified, was called the place of ascull; it was the common place of execution; for he was in all respectsnumbered with the transgressors. Whenever we look unto Christcrucified, we must remember what was written over his head; he is aKing, and we must give up ourselves to be his subjects, as Israelitesindeed. They crucified two thieves with him, and him in the midst; theythereby intended him great dishonour. But it was foretold that heshould be numbered with the transgressors, because he was made sin forus. Even those who passed by railed at him. They told him to come downfrom the cross, and they would believe; but they did not believe,though he gave them a more convincing sign when he came up from thegrave. With what earnestness will the man who firmly believes thetruth, as made known by the sufferings of Christ, seek for salvation!With what gratitude will he receive the dawning hope of forgiveness andeternal life, as purchased for him by the sufferings and death of theSon of God! and with what godly sorrow will he mourn over the sinswhich crucified the Lord of glory!
Mar 15:33-41	<br>There was a thick darkness over the land, from noon until three in theafternoon. The Jews were doing their utmost to extinguish the Sun ofRighteousness. The darkness signified the cloud which the human soul ofChrist was under, when he was making it an offering for sin. He did notcomplain that his disciples forsook him, but that his Father forsookhim. In this especially he was made sin for us. When Paul was to beoffered as a sacrifice for the service saints, he could joy andrejoice, Php 2:17; but it is another thing to be offered as a sacrificefor the sin of sinners. At the same instant that Jesus died, the veilof the temple was rent from the top to the bottom. This spake terror tothe unbelieving Jews, and was a sign of the destruction of their churchand nation. It speaks comfort to all believing Christians, for itsignified the laying open a new and living way into the holiest by theblood of Jesus. The confidence with which Christ had openly addressedGod as his Father, and committed his soul into his hands, seems greatlyto have affected the centurion. Right views of Christ crucified willreconcile the believer to the thought of death; he longs to behold,love, and praise, as he ought, that Saviour who was wounded and piercedto save him from the wrath to come.
Mar 15:42-47	<br>We are here attending the burial of our Lord Jesus. Oh that we may bygrace be planted in the likeness of it! Joseph of Arimathea was one whowaited for the kingdom of God. Those who hope for a share in itsprivileges, must own Christ's cause, when it seems to be crushed. Thisman God raised up for his service. There was a special providence, thatPilate should be so strict in his inquiry, that there might be nopretence to say Jesus was alive. Pilate gave Joseph leave to take downthe body, and do what he pleased with it. Some of the women beheldwhere Jesus was laid, that they might come after the sabbath to anointthe dead body, because they had not time to do it before. Specialnotice was taken of Christ's sepulchre, because he was to rise again.And he will not forsake those who trust in him, and call upon him.Death, deprived of its sting, will soon end the believer's sorrows, asit ended those of the Saviour.
Mar 16:1-8	<br>Nicodemus brought a large quantity of spices, but these good women didnot think that enough. The respect others show to Christ, should nothinder us from showing our respect. And those who are carried by holyzeal, to seek Christ diligently, will find the difficulties in theirway speedily vanish. When we put ourselves to trouble and expense, fromlove to Christ, we shall be accepted, though our endeavours are notsuccessful. The sight of the angel might justly have encouraged them,but they were affrighted. Thus many times that which should be matterof comfort to us, through our own mistake, proves a terror to us. Hewas crucified, but he is glorified. He is risen, he is not here, notdead, but alive again; hereafter you will see him, but you may here seethe place where he was laid. Thus seasonable comforts will be sent tothose that lament after the Lord Jesus. Peter is particularly named,Tell Peter; it will be most welcome to him, for he is in sorrow forsin. A sight of Christ will be very welcome to a true penitent, and atrue penitent is very welcome to a sight of Christ. The men ran withall the haste they could to the disciples; but disquieting fears oftenhinder us from doing that service to Christ and to the souls of men,which, if faith and the joy of faith were strong, we might do.
Mar 16:9-13	<br>Better news cannot be brought to disciples in tears, than to tell themof Christ's resurrection. And we should study to comfort disciples thatare mourners, by telling them whatever we have seen of Christ. It was awise providence that the proofs of Christ's resurrection were givengradually, and admitted cautiously, that the assurance with which theapostles preached this doctrine afterwards might the more satisfy. Yethow slowly do we admit the consolations which the word of God holdsforth! Therefore while Christ comforts his people, he often sees itneedful to rebuke and correct them for hardness of heart in distrustinghis promise, as well as in not obeying his holy precepts.
Mar 16:14-18	<br>The evidences of the truth of the gospel are so full, that those whoreceive it not, may justly be upbraided with their unbelief. Ourblessed Lord renewed his choice of the eleven as his apostles, andcommissioned them to go into all the world, to preach his gospel toevery creature. Only he that is a true Christian shall be saved throughChrist. Simon Magus professed to believe, and was baptized, yet he wasdeclared to be in the bonds of iniquity: see his history in Ac 8:13-25.Doubtless this is a solemn declaration of that true faith whichreceives Christ in all his characters and offices, and for all thepurposes of salvation, and which produces its right effect on the heartand life; not a mere assent, which is a dead faith, and cannot profit.The commission of Christ's ministers extends to every creaturethroughout the world, and the declarations of the gospel contain notonly truths, encouragements, and precepts, but also most awfulwarnings. Observe what power the apostles should be endued with, forconfirming the doctrine they were to preach. These were miracles toconfirm the truth of the gospel, and means of spreading the gospelamong nations that had not heard it.
Mar 16:19,20	<br>After the Lord had spoken he went up into heaven. Sitting is a postureof rest, he had finished his work; and a posture of rule, he tookpossession of his kingdom. He sat at the right hand of God, whichdenotes his sovereign dignity and universal power. Whatever God doesconcerning us, gives to us, or accepts from us, it is by his Son. Nowhe is glorified with the glory he had before the world. The apostleswent forth, and preached every where, far and near. Though the doctrinethey preached was spiritual and heavenly, and directly contrary to thespirit and temper of the world; though it met with much opposition, andwas wholly destitute of all worldly supports and advantages; yet in afew years the sound went forth unto the ends of the earth. Christ'sministers do not now need to work miracles to prove their message; theScriptures are proved to be of Divine origin, and this renders thosewithout excuse who reject or neglect them. The effects of the gospel,when faithfully preached, and truly believed, in changing the tempersand characters of mankind, form a constant proof, a miraculous proof,that the gospel is the power of God unto salvation, of all who believe.
Luk 1:1-4	<br>Luke will not write of things about which Christians may safely differfrom one another, and hesitate within themselves; but the things whichare, and ought to be surely believed. The doctrine of Christ is whatthe wisest and best of men have ventured their souls upon withconfidence and satisfaction. And the great events whereon our hopesdepend, have been recorded by those who were from the beginningeye-witnesses and ministers of the word, and who were perfected intheir understanding of them through Divine inspiration.
Luk 1:5-25	<br>The father and mother of John the Baptist were sinners as all are, andwere justified and saved in the same way as others; but they wereeminent for piety and integrity. They had no children, and it could notbe expected that Elisabeth should have any in her old age. WhileZacharias was burning incense in the temple, the whole multitude of thepeople were praying without. All the prayers we offer up to God, areacceptable and successful only by Christ's intercession in the templeof God above. We cannot expect an interest therein if we do not pray,and pray with our spirits, and are not earnest in prayer. Nor can weexpect that the best of our prayers should gain acceptance, and bringan answer of peace, but through the mediation of Christ, who everlives, making intercession. The prayers Zacharias often made, receivedan answer of peace. Prayers of faith are filed in heaven, and are notforgotten. Prayers made when we were young and entering into the world,may be answered when we are old and going out of the world. Mercies aredoubly sweet that are given in answer to prayer. Zacharias shall have ason in his old age, who shall be instrumental in the conversion of manysouls to God, and preparing them to receive the gospel of Christ. Heshall go before Him with courage, zeal, holiness, and a mind dead toearthly interests and pleasures. The disobedient and rebellious wouldbe brought back to the wisdom of their righteous forefathers, orrather, brought to attend to the wisdom of that Just One who was comingamong them. Zacharias heard all that the angel said; but his unbeliefspake. In striking him dumb, God dealt justly with him, because he hadobjected against God's word. We may admire the patience of God towardsus. God dealt kindly with him, for thus he prevented his speaking anymore distrustful, unbelieving words. Thus also God confirmed his faith.If by the rebukes we are under for our sin, we are brought to give themore credit to the word of God, we have no reason to complain. Evenreal believers are apt to dishonour God by unbelief; and their mouthsare stopped in silence and confusion, when otherwise they would havebeen praising God with joy and gratitude. In God's gracious dealingswith us we ought to observe his gracious regards to us. He has lookedon us with compassion and favour, and therefore has thus dealt with us.
Luk 1:26-38	<br>We have here an account of the mother of our Lord; though we are not topray to her, yet we ought to praise God for her. Christ must be bornmiraculously. The angel's address means only, Hail, thou that art theespecially chosen and favoured of the Most High, to attain the honourJewish mothers have so long desired. This wondrous salutation andappearance troubled Mary. The angel then assured her that she had foundfavour with God, and would become the mother of a son whose name sheshould call Jesus, the Son of the Highest, one in a nature andperfection with the Lord God. JESUS! the name that refreshes thefainting spirits of humbled sinners; sweet to speak and sweet to hear,Jesus, a Saviour! We know not his riches and our own poverty, thereforewe run not to him; we perceive not that we are lost and perishing,therefore a Saviour is a word of little relish. Were we convinced ofthe huge mass of guilt that lies upon us, and the wrath that hangs overus for it, ready to fall upon us, it would be our continual thought, Isthe Saviour mine? And that we might find him so, we should trample onall that hinders our way to him. Mary's reply to the angel was thelanguage of faith and humble admiration, and she asked no sign for theconfirming her faith. Without controversy, great was the mystery ofgodliness, God manifest in the flesh, 1Ti 3:16. Christ's human naturemust be produced so, as it was fit that should be which was to be takeninto union with the Divine nature. And we must, as Mary here, guide ourdesires by the word of God. In all conflicts, let us remember that withGod nothing is impossible; and as we read and hear his promises, let usturn them into prayers, Behold the willing servant of the Lord; let itbe unto me according to thy word.
Luk 1:39-56	<br>It is very good for those who have the work of grace begun in theirsouls, to communicate one to another. On Mary's arrival, Elisabeth wasconscious of the approach of her who was to be the mother of the greatRedeemer. At the same time she was filled with the Holy Ghost, andunder his influence declared that Mary and her expected child were mostblessed and happy, as peculiarly honoured of and dear to the Most HighGod. Mary, animated by Elisabeth's address, and being also under theinfluence of the Holy Ghost, broke out into joy, admiration, andgratitude. She knew herself to be a sinner who needed a Saviour, andthat she could no otherwise rejoice in God than as interested in hissalvation through the promised Messiah. Those who see their need ofChrist, and are desirous of righteousness and life in him, he fillswith good things, with the best things; and they are abundantlysatisfied with the blessings he gives. He will satisfy the desires ofthe poor in spirit who long for spiritual blessings, while theself-sufficient shall be sent empty away.
Luk 1:57-66	<br>In these verses we have an account of the birth of John the Baptist,and the great joy among all the relations of the family. He shall becalled Johanan, or "Gracious," because he shall bring in the gospel ofChrist, wherein God's grace shines most bright. Zacharias recovered hisspeech. Unbelief closed his mouth, and believing opened it again: hebelievers, therefore he speaks. When God opens our lips, our mouthsmust show forth his praise; and better be without speech, than not useit in praising God. It is said, The hand of the Lord was working withJohn. God has ways of working on children in their infancy, which wecannot account for. We should observe the dealings of God, and wait theevent.
Luk 1:67-80	<br>Zacharias uttered a prophecy concerning the kingdom and salvation ofthe Messiah. The gospel brings light with it; in it the day dawns. InJohn the Baptist it began to break, and increased apace to the perfectday. The gospel is discovering; it shows that about which we wereutterly in the dark; it is to give light to those that sit in darkness,the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of JesusChrist. It is reviving; it brings light to those that sit in the shadowof death, as condemned prisoners in the dungeon. It is directing; it isto guide our feet in the way of peace, into that way which will bringus to peace at last, Ro 3:17. John gave proofs of strong faith,vigorous and holy affections, and of being above the fear and love ofthe world. Thus he ripened for usefulness; but he lived a retired life,till he came forward openly as the forerunner of the Messiah. Let usfollow peace with all men, as well as seek peace with God and our ownconsciences. And if it be the will of God that we live unknown to theworld, still let us diligently seek to grow strong in the grace ofJesus Christ.
Luk 2:1-7	<br>The fulness of time was now come, when God would send forth his Son,made of a woman, and made under the law. The circumstances of his birthwere very mean. Christ was born at an inn; he came into the world tosojourn here for awhile, as at an inn, and to teach us to do likewise.We are become by sin like an outcast infant, helpless and forlorn; andsuch a one was Christ. He well knew how unwilling we are to be meanlylodged, clothed, or fed; how we desire to have our children decoratedand indulged; how apt the poor are to envy the rich, and how prone therich to disdain the poor. But when we by faith view the Son of Godbeing made man and lying in a manger, our vanity, ambition, and envyare checked. We cannot, with this object rightly before us, seek greatthings for ourselves or our children.
Luk 2:8-20	<br>Angels were heralds of the new-born Saviour, but they were only sent tosome poor, humble, pious, industrious shepherds, who were in thebusiness of their calling, keeping watch over their flock. We are notout of the way of Divine visits, when we are employed in an honestcalling, and abide with God in it. Let God have the honour of thiswork; Glory to God in the highest. God's good-will to men, manifestedin sending the Messiah, redounds to his praise. Other works of God arefor his glory, but the redemption of the world is for his glory in thehighest. God's goodwill in sending the Messiah, brought peace into thislower world. Peace is here put for all that good which flows to us fromChrist's taking our nature upon him. This is a faithful saying,attested by an innumerable company of angels, and well worthy of allacceptation, That the good-will of God toward men, is glory to God inthe highest, and peace on the earth. The shepherds lost no time, butcame with haste to the place. They were satisfied, and made knownabroad concerning this child, that he was the Saviour, even Christ theLord. Mary carefully observed and thought upon all these things, whichwere so suited to enliven her holy affections. We should be moredelivered from errors in judgment and practice, did we more fullyponder these things in our hearts. It is still proclaimed in our earsthat to us is born a Saviour, Christ the Lord. These should be gladtidings to all.
Luk 2:21-24	<br>Our Lord Jesus was not born in sin, and did not need that mortificationof a corrupt nature, or that renewal unto holiness, which weresignified by circumcision. This ordinance was, in his case, a pledge ofhis future perfect obedience to the whole law, in the midst ofsufferings and temptations, even unto death for us. At the end of fortydays, Mary went up to the temple to offer the appointed sacrifices forher purification. Joseph also presented the holy child Jesus, because,as a first-born son, he was to be presented to the Lord, and redeemedaccording to the law. Let us present our children to the Lord who gavethem to us, beseeching him to redeem them from sin and death, and makethem holy to himself.
Luk 2:25-35	<br>The same Spirit that provided for the support of Simeon's hope,provided for his joy. Those who would see Christ must go to his temple.Here is a confession of his faith, that this Child in his arms was theSaviour, the salvation itself, the salvation of God's appointing. Hebids farewell to this world. How poor does this world look to one thathas Christ in his arms, and salvation in his view! See here, howcomfortable is the death of a good man; he departs in peace with God,peace with his own conscience, in peace with death. Those that havewelcomed Christ, may welcome death. Joseph and Mary marvelled at thethings which were spoken of this Child. Simeon shows them likewise,what reason they had to rejoice with trembling. And Jesus, hisdoctrine, and people, are still spoken against; his truth and holinessare still denied and blasphemed; his preached word is still thetouchstone of men's characters. The secret good affections in the mindsof some, will be revealed by their embracing Christ; the secretcorruptions of others will be revealed by their enmity to Christ. Menwill be judged by the thoughts of their hearts concerning Christ. Heshall be a suffering Jesus; his mother shall suffer with him, becauseof the nearness of her relation and affection.
Luk 2:36-40	<br>There was much evil then in the church, yet God left not himselfwithout witness. Anna always dwelt in, or at least attended at, thetemple. She was always in a praying spirit; gave herself to prayer, andin all things she served God. Those to whom Christ is made known, havegreat reason to thank the Lord. She taught others concerning him. Letthe example of the venerable saints, Simeon and Anna, give courage tothose whose hoary heads are, like theirs, a crown of glory, being foundin the way of righteousness. The lips soon to be silent in the grave,should be showing forth the praises of the Redeemer. In all things itbecame Christ to be made like unto his brethren, therefore he passedthrough infancy and childhood as other children, yet without sin, andwith manifest proofs of the Divine nature in him. By the Spirit of Godall his faculties performed their offices in a manner not seen in anyone else. Other children have foolishness bound in their hearts, whichappears in what they say or do, but he was filled with wisdom, by theinfluence of the Holy Ghost; every thing he said and did, was wiselysaid and wisely done, above his years. Other children show thecorruption of their nature; nothing but the grace of God was upon him.
Luk 2:41-52	<br>It is for the honour of Christ that children should attend on publicworship. His parents did not return till they had stayed all the sevendays of the feast. It is well to stay to the end of an ordinance, asbecomes those who say, It is good to be here. Those that have losttheir comforts in Christ, and the evidences of their having a part inhim, must bethink themselves where, and when, and how they lost them,and must turn back again. Those that would recover their lostacquaintance with Christ, must go to the place in which he has put hisname; there they may hope to meet him. They found him in some part ofthe temple, where the doctors of the law kept their schools; he wassitting there, hearkening to their instructions, proposing questions,and answering inquiries, with such wisdom, that those who heard weredelighted with him. Young persons should seek the knowledge of Divinetruth, attend the ministry of the gospel, and ask such questions oftheir elders and teachers as may tend to increase their knowledge.Those who seek Christ in sorrow, shall find him with the greater joy.Know ye not that I ought to be in my Father's house; at my Father'swork; I must be about my Father's business. Herein is an example; forit becomes the children of God, in conformity to Christ, to attendtheir heavenly Father's business, and make all other concerns give wayto it. Though he was the Son of God, yet he was subject to his earthlyparents; how then will the foolish and weak sons of men answer it, whoare disobedient to their parents? However we may neglect men's sayings,because they are obscure, yet we must not think so of God's sayings.That which at first is dark, may afterwards become plain and easy. Thegreatest and wisest, those most eminent, may learn of this admirableand Divine Child, that it is the truest greatness of soul to know ourown place and office; to deny ourselves amusements and pleasures notconsistent with our state and calling.
Luk 3:1-14	<br>The scope and design of John's ministry were, to bring the people fromtheir sins, and to their Saviour. He came preaching, not a sect, orparty, but a profession; the sign or ceremony was washing with water.By the words here used John preached the necessity of repentance, inorder to the remission of sins, and that the baptism of water was anoutward sign of that inward cleansing and renewal of heart, whichattend, or are the effects of true repentance, as well as a professionof it. Here is the fulfilling of the Scriptures, Isa 40:3, in theministry of John. When way is made for the gospel into the heart, bytaking down high thoughts, and bringing them into obedience to Christ,by levelling the soul, and removing all that hinders us in the way ofChrist and his grace, then preparation is made to welcome the salvationof God. Here are general warnings and exhortations which John gave. Theguilty, corrupted race of mankind is become a generation of vipers;hateful to God, and hating one another. There is no way of fleeing fromthe wrath to come, but by repentance; and by the change of our way thechange of our mind must be shown. If we are not really holy, both inheart and life, our profession of religion and relation to God and hischurch, will stand us in no stead at all; the sorer will ourdestruction be, if we do not bring forth fruits meet for repentance.John the Baptist gave instructions to several sorts of persons. Thosethat profess and promise repentance, must show it by reformation,according to their places and conditions. The gospel requires mercy,not sacrifice; and its design is, to engage us to do all the good wecan, and to be just to all men. And the same principle which leads mento forego unjust gain, leads to restore that which is gained by wrong.John tells the soldiers their duty. Men should be cautioned against thetemptations of their employments. These answers declared the presentduty of the inquirers, and at once formed a test of their sincerity. Asnone can or will accept Christ's salvation without true repentance, sothe evidence and effects of this repentance are here marked out.
Luk 3:15-20	<br>John the Baptist disowned being himself the Christ, but confirmed thepeople in their expectations of the long-promised Messiah. He couldonly exhort them to repent, and assure them of forgiveness uponrepentance; but he could not work repentance in them, nor conferremission on them. Thus highly does it become us to speak of Christ,and thus humbly of ourselves. John can do no more than baptize withwater, in token that they ought to purify and cleanse themselves; butChrist can, and will baptize with the Holy Ghost; he can give theSpirit, to cleanse and purify the heart, not only as water washes offthe dirt on the outside, but as fire clears out the dross that iswithin, and melts down the metal, that it may be cast into a new mould.John was an affectionate preacher; he was beseeching; he pressed thingshome upon his hearers. He was a practical preacher; quickening them totheir duty, and directing them in it. He was a popular preacher; headdressed the people, according to their capacity. He was anevangelical preacher. In all his exhortations, he directed people toChrist. When we press duty upon people, we must direct them to Christ,both for righteousness and strength. He was a copious preacher; heshunned not to declare the whole counsel of God. But a full stop wasput to John's preaching when he was in the midst of his usefulness.Herod being reproved by him for many evils, shut up John in prison.Those who injure the faithful servants of God, add still greater guiltto their other sins.
Luk 3:21,22	<br>Christ did not confess sin, as others did, for he had none to confess;but he prayed, as others did, and kept up communion with his Father.Observe, all the three voices from heaven, by which the Father barewitness to the Son, were pronounced while he was praying, or soonafter, Lu 9:35; Joh 12:28. The Holy Ghost descended in a bodily shapelike a dove upon him, and there came a voice from heaven, from God theFather, from the excellent glory. Thus was a proof of the Holy Trinity,of the Three Persons in the Godhead, given at the baptism of Christ.
Luk 3:23-38	<br>Matthew's list of the forefathers of Jesus showed that Christ was theson of Abraham, in whom all the families of the earth are blessed, andheir to the throne of David; but Luke shows that Jesus was the Seed ofthe woman that should break the serpent's head, and traces the line upto Adam, beginning with Eli, or Heli, the father, not of Joseph, but ofMary. The seeming differences between the two evangelists in theselists of names have been removed by learned men. But our salvation doesnot depend upon our being able to solve these difficulties, nor is theDivine authority of the Gospels at all weakened by them. The list ofnames ends thus, "Who was the son of Adam, the son of God;" that is,the offspring of God by creation. Christ was both the son of Adam andthe Son of God, that he might be a proper Mediator between God and thesons of Adam, and might bring the sons of Adam to be, through him, thesons of God. All flesh, as descended from the first Adam, is as grass,and withers as the flower of the field; but he who partakes of the HolySpirit of life from the Second Adam, has that eternal happiness, whichby the gospel is preached unto us.
Luk 4:1-13	<br>Christ's being led into the wilderness gave an advantage to thetempter; for there he was alone, none were with him by whose prayersand advice he might be helped in the hour of temptation. He who knewhis own strength might give Satan advantage; but we may not, who knowour own weakness. Being in all things made like unto his brethren,Jesus would, like the other children of God, live in dependence uponthe Divine Providence and promise. The word of God is our sword, andfaith in that word is our shield. God has many ways of providing forhis people, and therefore is at all times to be depended upon in theway of duty. All Satan's promises are deceitful; and if he is permittedto have any influence in disposing of the kingdoms of the world and theglory of them, he uses them as baits to insnare men to destruction. Weshould reject at once and with abhorrence, every opportunity of sinfulgain or advancement, as a price offered for our souls; we should seekriches, honours, and happiness in the worship and service of God only.Christ will not worship Satan; nor, when he has the kingdoms of theworld delivered to him by his Father, will he suffer any remains of theworship of the devil to continue in them. Satan also tempted Jesus tobe his own murderer, by unfitting confidence in his Father'sprotection, such as he had no warrant for. Let not any abuse ofScripture by Satan or by men abate our esteem, or cause us to abandonits use; but let us study it still, seek to know it, and seek ourdefence from it in all kinds of assaults. Let this word dwell richly inus, for it is our life. Our victorious Redeemer conquered, not forhimself only, but for us also. The devil ended all the temptation.Christ let him try all his force, and defeated him. Satan saw it was tono purpose to attack Christ, who had nothing in him for his fiery dartsto fasten upon. And if we resist the devil, he will flee from us. Yethe departed but till the season when he was again to be let loose uponJesus, not as a tempter, to draw him to sin, and so to strike at hishead, at which he now aimed and was wholly defeated in; but as apersecutor, to bring Christ to suffer, and so to bruise his heel, whichit was told him, he should have to do, and would do, though it would bethe breaking of his own head, Ge 3:15. Though Satan depart for aseason, we shall never be out of his reach till removed from thispresent evil world.
Luk 4:14-30	<br>Christ taught in their synagogues, their places of public worship,where they met to read, expound, and apply the word, to pray andpraise. All the gifts and graces of the Spirit were upon him and onhim, without measure. By Christ, sinners may be loosed from the bondsof guilt, and by his Spirit and grace from the bondage of corruption.He came by the word of his gospel, to bring light to those that sat inthe dark, and by the power of his grace, to give sight to those thatwere blind. And he preached the acceptable year of the Lord. Letsinners attend to the Saviour's invitation when liberty is thusproclaimed. Christ's name was Wonderful; in nothing was he more so thanin the word of his grace, and the power that went along with it. We maywell wonder that he should speak such words of grace to such gracelesswretches as mankind. Some prejudice often furnishes an objectionagainst the humbling doctrine of the cross; and while it is the word ofGod that stirs up men's enmity, they will blame the conduct or mannerof the speaker. The doctrine of God's sovereignty, his right to do hiswill, provokes proud men. They will not seek his favour in his own way;and are angry when others have the favours they neglect. Still is Jesusrejected by multitudes who hear the same message from his words. Whilethey crucify him afresh by their sins, may we honour him as the Son ofGod, the Saviour of men, and seek to show we do so by our obedience.
Luk 4:31-44	<br>Christ's preaching much affected the people; and a working power wentwith it to the consciences of men. These miracles showed Christ to be acontroller and conqueror of Satan, a healer of diseases. Where Christgives a new life, in recovery from sickness, it should be a new life,spent more than ever in his service, to his glory. Our business shouldbe to spread abroad Christ's fame in every place, to beseech him inbehalf of those diseased in body or mind, and to use our influence inbringing sinners to him, that his hands may be laid upon them for theirhealing. He cast the devils out of many who were possessed. We were notsent into this world to live to ourselves only, but to glorify God, andto do good in our generation. The people sought him, and came unto him.A desert is no desert, if we are with Christ there. He will continuewith us, by his word and Spirit, and extend the same blessings to othernations, till, throughout the earth, the servants and worshippers ofSatan are brought to acknowledge him as the Christ, the Son of God, andto find redemption through his blood, even the forgiveness of sins.
Luk 5:1-11	<br>When Christ had done preaching, he told Peter to apply to the businessof his calling. Time spent on week days in public exercises ofreligion, need be but little hinderance in time, and may be greatfurtherance to us in temper of mind, as to our worldly business. Withwhat cheerfulness may we go about the duties of our calling, when wehave been with God, and thus have our worldly employments sanctified tous by the word and prayer! Though they had taken nothing, yet Christtold them to let down their nets again. We must not abruptly quit ourcallings because we have not the success in them we desire. We arelikely to speed well, when we follow the guidance of Christ's word. Thedraught of fishes was by a miracle. We must all, like Peter, ownourselves to be sinful men, therefore Jesus Christ might justly departfrom us. But we must beseech him that he would not depart; for woe untous if the Saviour depart from sinners! Rather let us entreat him tocome and dwell in our hearts by faith, that he may transform andcleanse them. These fishermen forsook all, and followed Jesus, whentheir calling prospered. When riches increase, and we are tempted toset our hearts upon them, then to quit them for Christ is thankworthy.
Luk 5:12-16	<br>This man is said to be full of leprosy; he had that distemper in a highdegree, which represents our natural pollution by sin; we are full ofthat leprosy; from the crown of the head to the sole of the foot thereis no soundness in us. Strong confidence and deep humility are unitedin the words of this leper. And if any sinner, from a deep sense ofvileness, says, I know the Lord can cleanse, but will he look upon sucha one as me? will he apply his own precious blood for my cleansing andhealing? Yes, he will. Speak not as doubting, but as humbly referringthe matter to Christ. And being saved from the guilt and power of oursins, let us spread abroad Christ's fame, and bring others to hear himand to be healed.
Luk 5:17-26	<br>How many are there in our assemblies, where the gospel is preached, whodo not sit under the word, but sit by! It is to them as a tale that istold them, not as a message that is sent to them. Observe the dutiestaught and recommended to us by the history of the paralytic. Inapplying to Christ, we must be very pressing and urgent; that is anevidence of faith, and is very pleasing to Christ, and prevailing withhim. Give us, Lord, the same kind of faith with respect to thy abilityand willingness to heal our souls. Give us to desire the pardon of sinmore than any earthly blessing, or life itself. Enable us to believethy power to forgive sins; then will our souls cheerfully arise and gowhere thou pleasest.
Luk 5:27-39	<br>It was a wonder of Christ's grace, that he would call a publican to behis disciple and follower. It was a wonder of his grace, that the callwas made so effectual. It was a wonder of his grace, that he came tocall sinners to repentance, and to assure them of pardon. It was awonder of his grace, that he so patiently bore the contradiction ofsinners against himself and his disciples. It was a wonder of hisgrace, that he fixed the services of his disciples according to theirstrength and standing. The Lord trains up his people gradually for thetrials allotted them; we should copy his example in dealing with theweak in faith, or the tempted believer.
Luk 6:1-5	<br>Christ justifies his disciples in a work of necessity for themselves onthe sabbath day, and that was plucking the ears of corn when they werehungry. But we must take heed that we mistake not this liberty forleave to commit sin. Christ will have us to know and remember that itis his day, therefore to be spent in his service, and to his honour.
Luk 6:6-11	<br>Christ was neither ashamed nor afraid to own the purposes of his grace.He healed the poor man, though he knew that his enemies would takeadvantage against him for it. Let us not be drawn either from our dutyor from our usefulness by any opposition. We may well be amazed, thatthe sons of men should be so wicked.
Luk 6:12-19	<br>We often think one half hour a great deal to spend in meditation andsecret prayer, but Christ was whole nights engaged in these duties. Inserving God, our great care should be not to lose time, but to make theend of one good duty the beginning of another. The twelve apostles arehere named; never were men so privileged, yet one of them had a devil,and proved a traitor. Those who have not faithful preaching near them,had better travel far than be without it. It is indeed worth while togo a great way to hear the word of Christ, and to go out of the way ofother business for it. They came to be cured by him, and he healedthem. There is a fulness of grace in Christ, and healing virtue in him,ready to go out from him, that is enough for all, enough for each. Menregard the diseases of the body as greater evils than those of theirsouls; but the Scripture teaches us differently.
Luk 6:20-26	<br>Here begins a discourse of Christ, most of which is also found in Mt 5;7. But some think that this was preached at another time and place. Allbelievers that take the precepts of the gospel to themselves, and liveby them, may take the promises of the gospel to themselves, and liveupon them. Woes are denounced against prosperous sinners as miserablepeople, though the world envies them. Those are blessed indeed whomChrist blesses, but those must be dreadfully miserable who fall underhis woe and curse! What a vast advantage will the saint have over thesinner in the other world! and what a wide difference will there be intheir rewards, how much soever the sinner may prosper, and the saint beafflicted here!
Luk 6:27-36	<br>These are hard lessons to flesh and blood. But if we are thoroughlygrounded in the faith of Christ's love, this will make his commandseasy to us. Every one that comes to him for washing in his blood, andknows the greatness of the mercy and the love there is in him, can say,in truth and sincerity, Lord, what wilt thou have me to do? Let us thenaim to be merciful, even according to the mercy of our heavenly Fatherto us.
Luk 6:37-49	<br>All these sayings Christ often used; it was easy to apply them. Weought to be very careful when we blame others; for we need allowanceourselves. If we are of a giving and a forgiving spirit, we shallourselves reap the benefit. Though full and exact returns are made inanother world, not in this world, yet Providence does what shouldencourage us in doing good. Those who follow the multitude to do evil,follow in the broad way that leads to destruction. The tree is known byits fruits; may the word of Christ be so grafted in our hearts, that wemay be fruitful in every good word and work. And what the mouthcommonly speaks, generally agrees with what is most in the heart. Thoseonly make sure work for their souls and eternity, and take the coursethat will profit in a trying time, who think, speak, and act accordingto the words of Christ. Those who take pains in religion, found theirhope upon Christ, who is the Rock of Ages, and other foundation can noman lay. In death and judgment they are safe, being kept by the powerof Christ through faith unto salvation, and they shall never perish.
Luk 7:1-10	<br>Servants should study to endear themselves to their masters. Mastersought to take particular care of their servants when they are sick. Wemay still, by faithful and fervent prayer, apply to Christ, and oughtto do so when sickness is in our families. The building places forreligious worship is a good work, and an instance of love to God andhis people. Our Lord Jesus was pleased with the centurion's faith; andhe never fails to answer the expectations of that faith which honourshis power and love. The cure soon wrought and perfect.
Luk 7:11-18	<br>When the Lord saw the poor widow following her son to the grave, he hadcompassion on her. See Christ's power over death itself. The gospelcall to all people, to young people particularly, is, Arise from thedead, and Christ shall give you light and life. When Christ put lifeinto him, it appeared by the youth's sitting up. Have we grace fromChrist? Let us show it. He began to speak: whenever Christ gives usspiritual life, he opens the lips in prayer and praise. When dead soulsare raised to spiritual life, by Divine power going with the gospel, wemust glorify God, and look upon it as a gracious visit to his people.Let us seek for such an interest in our compassionate Saviour, that wemay look forward with joy to the time when the Redeemer's voice shallcall forth all that are in their graves. May we be called to theresurrection of life, not to that of damnation.
Luk 7:19-35	<br>To his miracles in the kingdom of nature, Christ adds this in thekingdom of grace, To the poor the gospel is preached. It clearlypointed out the spiritual nature of Christ's kingdom, that themessenger he sent before him to prepare his way, did it by preachingrepentance and reformation of heart and life. We have here the justblame of those who were not wrought upon by the ministry of JohnBaptist or of Jesus Christ himself. They made a jest of the methods Godtook to do them good. This is the ruin of multitudes; they are notserious in the concerns of their souls. Let us study to prove ourselveschildren of Wisdom, by attending the instructions of God's word, andadoring those mysteries and glad tidings which infidels and Phariseesderide and blaspheme.
Luk 7:36-50	<br>None can truly perceive how precious Christ is, and the glory of thegospel, except the broken-hearted. But while they feel they cannotenough express self-abhorrence on account of sin, and admiration of hismercy, the self-sufficient will be disgusted, because the gospelencourages such repenting sinners. The Pharisee, instead of rejoicingin the tokens of the woman's repentance, confined his thoughts to herformer bad character. But without free forgiveness none of us canescape the wrath to come; this our gracious Saviour has purchased withhis blood, that he may freely bestow it on every one that believes inhim. Christ, by a parable, forced Simon to acknowledge that the greatersinner this woman had been, the greater love she ought to show to Himwhen her sins were pardoned. Learn here, that sin is a debt; and allare sinners, are debtors to Almighty God. Some sinners are greaterdebtors; but whether our debt be more or less, it is more than we areable to pay. God is ready to forgive; and his Son having purchasedpardon for those who believe in him, his gospel promises it to them,and his Spirit seals it to repenting sinners, and gives them thecomfort. Let us keep far from the proud spirit of the Pharisee, simplydepending upon and rejoicing in Christ alone, and so be prepared toobey him more zealously, and more strongly to recommend him unto allaround us. The more we express our sorrow for sin, and our love toChrist, the clearer evidence we have of the forgiveness of our sins.What a wonderful change does grace make upon a sinner's heart and life,as well as upon his state before God, by the full remission of all hissins through faith in the Lord Jesus!
Luk 8:1-3	<br>We are here told what Christ made the constant business of his life, itwas teaching the gospel. Tidings of the kingdom of God are gladtidings, and what Christ came to bring. Certain women attended upon himwho ministered to him of their substance. It showed the mean conditionto which the Saviour humbled himself, that he needed their kindness,and his great humility, that he accepted it. Though rich, yet for oursakes he became poor.
Luk 8:4-21	<br>There are many very needful and excellent rules and cautions forhearing the word, in the parable of the sower, and the application ofit. Happy are we, and for ever indebted to free grace, if the samething that is a parable to others, with which they are only amused, isa plain truth to us, by which we are taught and governed. We ought totake heed of the things that will hinder our profiting by the word wehear; to take heed lest we hear carelessly and slightly, lest weentertain prejudices against the word we hear; and to take heed to ourspirits after we have heard the word, lest we lose what we have gained.The gifts we have, will be continued to us or not, as we use them forthe glory of God, and the good of our brethren. Nor is it enough not tohold the truth in unrighteousness; we should desire to hold forth theword of life, and to shine, giving light to all around. Greatencouragement is given to those who prove themselves faithful hearersof the word, by being doers of the work. Christ owns them as hisrelations.
Luk 8:22-40	<br>Those that put to sea in a calm, even at Christ's word, must yetprepare for a storm, and for great peril in that storm. There is norelief for souls under a sense of guilt, and fear of wrath, but to goto Christ, and call him Master, and say, I am undone, if thou dost nothelp me. When our dangers are over, it becomes us to take to ourselvesthe shame of our own fears, and to give Christ the glory of ourdeliverance. We may learn much out of this history concerning the worldof infernal, malignant spirits, which though not working now exactly inthe same way as then, yet all must at all times carefully guardagainst. And these malignant spirits are very numerous. They haveenmity to man and all his comforts. Those under Christ's government aresweetly led with the bands of love; those under the devil's governmentare furiously driven. Oh what a comfort it is to the believer, that allthe powers of darkness are under the control of the Lord Jesus! It is amiracle of mercy, if those whom Satan possesses, are not brought todestruction and eternal ruin. Christ will not stay with those whoslight him; perhaps he may no more return to them, while others arewaiting for him, and glad to receive him.
Luk 8:41-56	<br>Let us not complain of a crowd, and a throng, and a hurry, as long aswe are in the way of our duty, and doing good; but otherwise every wiseman will keep himself out of it as much as he can. And many a poor soulis healed, and helped, and saved by Christ, that is hidden in a crowd,and nobody notices it. This woman came trembling, yet her faith savedher. There may be trembling, where yet there is saving faith. ObserveChrist's comfortable words to Jairus, Fear not, believe only, and thydaughter shall be made whole. No less hard was it not to grieve for theloss of an only child, than not to fear the continuance of that grief.But in perfect faith there is no fear; the more we fear, the less webelieve. The hand of Christ's grace goes with the calls of his word, tomake them effectual. Christ commanded to give her meat. As babes newborn, so those newly raised from sin, desire spiritual food, that theymay grow thereby.
Luk 9:1-9	<br>Christ sent his twelve disciples abroad, who by this time were able toteach others what they had received from the Lord. They must not beanxious to commend themselves to people's esteem by outward appearance.They must go as they were. The Lord Jesus is the fountain of power andauthority, to whom all creatures must, in one way or another, besubject; and if he goes with the word of his ministers in power, todeliver sinners from Satan's bondage, they may be sure that he willcare for their wants. When truth and love thus go together, and yet themessage of God is rejected and despised, it leaves men without excuse,and turns to a testimony against them. Herod's guilty conscience wasready to conclude that John was risen from the dead. He desired to seeJesus; and why did he not go and see him? Probably, because he thoughtit below him, or because he wished not to have any more reprovers ofsin. Delaying it now, his heart was hardened, and when he did seeJesus, he was as much prejudiced against him as others, Lu 23:11.
Luk 9:10-17	<br>The people followed Jesus, and though they came unseasonably, yet hegave them what they came for. He spake unto them of the kingdom of God.He healed those who had need of healing. And with five loaves of breadand two fishes, Christ fed five thousand men. He will not see thosethat fear him, and serve him faithfully, want any good thing. When wereceive creature-comforts, we must acknowledge that we receive themfrom God, and that we are unworthy to receive them; that we owe themall, and all the comfort we have in them, to the mediation of Christ,by whom the curse is taken away. The blessing of Christ will make alittle go a great way. He fills every hungry soul, abundantly satisfiesit with the goodness of his house. Here were fragments taken up: in ourFather's house there is bread enough, and to spare. We are notstraitened, nor stinted in Christ.
Luk 9:18-27	<br>It is an unspeakable comfort that our Lord Jesus is God's Anointed;this signifies that he was both appointed to be the Messiah, andqualified for it. Jesus discourses concerning his own sufferings anddeath. And so far must his disciples be from thinking how to preventhis sufferings, that they must prepare for their own. We often meetwith crosses in the way of duty; and though we must not pull them uponour own heads, yet, when they are laid for us, we must take them up,and carry them after Christ. It is well or ill with us, according as itis well or ill with our souls. The body cannot be happy, if the soul bemiserable in the other world; but the soul may be happy, though thebody is greatly afflicted and oppressed in this world. We must never beashamed of Christ and his gospel.
Luk 9:28-36	<br>Christ's transfiguration was a specimen of that glory in which he willcome to judge the world; and was an encouragement to his disciples tosuffer for him. Prayer is a transfiguring, transforming duty, whichmakes the face to shine. Our Lord Jesus, even in his transfiguration,was willing to speak concerning his death and sufferings. In ourgreatest glories on earth, let us remember that in this world we haveno continuing city. What need we have to pray to God for quickeninggrace, to make us lively! Yet that the disciples might be witnesses ofthis sign from heaven, after awhile they became awake, so that theywere able to give a full account of what passed. But those know notwhat they say, that talk of making tabernacles on earth for glorifiedsaints in heaven.
Luk 9:37-42	<br>How deplorable the case of this child! He was under the power of anevil spirit. Disease of that nature are more frightful than such asarise merely from natural causes. What mischief Satan does where hegets possession! But happy those that have access to Christ! He can dothat for us which his disciples cannot. A word from Christ healed thechild; and when our children recover from sickness, it is comfortableto receive them as healed by the hand of Christ.
Luk 9:43-50	<br>This prediction of Christ's sufferings was plain enough, but thedisciples would not understand it, because it agreed not with theirnotions. A little child is the emblem by which Christ teaches ussimplicity and humility. What greater honour can any man attain to inthis world, than to be received by men as a messenger of God andChrist; and to have God and Christ own themselves received and welcomedin him! If ever any society of Christians in this world, had reason tosilence those not of their own communion, the twelve disciples at thistime had; yet Christ warned them not to do the like again. Those may befound faithful followers of Christ, and may be accepted of him, who donot follow with us.
Luk 9:51-56	<br>The disciples did not consider that the conduct of the Samaritans wasrather the effect of national prejudices and bigotry, than of enmity tothe word and worship of God; and through they refused to receive Christand his disciples, they did not ill use or injure them, so that thecase was widely different from that of Ahaziah and Elijah. Nor werethey aware that the gospel dispensation was to be marked by miracles ofmercy. But above all, they were ignorant of the prevailing motives oftheir own hearts, which were pride and carnal ambition. Of this ourLord warned them. It is easy for us to say, Come, see our zeal for theLord! and to think we are very faithful in his cause, when we areseeking our own objects, and even doing harm instead of good to others.
Luk 9:57-62	<br>Here is one that is forward to follow Christ, but seems to have beenhasty and rash, and not to have counted the cost. If we mean to followChrist, we must lay aside the thoughts of great things in the world.Let us not try to join the profession of Christianity, with seekingafter worldly advantages. Here is another that seems resolved to followChrist, but he begs a short delay. To this man Christ first gave thecall; he said to him, Follow me. Religion teaches us to be kind andgood, to show piety at home, and to requite our parents; but we mustnot make these an excuse for neglecting our duty to God. Here isanother that is willing to follow Christ, but he must have a littletime to talk with his friends about it, and to set in order hishousehold affairs, and give directions concerning them. He seemed tohave worldly concerns more upon his heart than he ought to have, and hewas willing to enter into a temptation leading him from his purpose offollowing Christ. No one can do any business in a proper manner, if heis attending to other things. Those who begin with the work of God,must resolve to go on, or they will make nothing of it. Looking back,leads to drawing back, and drawing back is to perdition. He only thatendures to the end shall be saved.
Luk 10:1-16	<br>Christ sent the seventy disciples, two and two, that they mightstrengthen and encourage one another. The ministry of the gospel callsmen to receive Christ as a Prince and a Saviour; and he will surelycome in the power of his Spirit to all places whither he sends hisfaithful servants. But the doom of those who receive the grace of Godin vain, will be very fearful Those who despise the faithful ministersof Christ, who think meanly of them, and look scornfully upon them,will be reckoned as despisers of God and Christ.
Luk 10:17-24	<br>All our victories over Satan, are obtained by power derived from JesusChrist, and he must have all the praise. But let us beware of spiritualpride, which has been the destruction of many. Our Lord rejoiced at theprospect of the salvation of many souls. It was fit that particularnotice should be taken of that hour of joy; there were few such, for Hewas a man of sorrows: in that hour in which he saw Satan fall, andheard of the good success of his ministers, in that hour he rejoiced.He has ever resisted the proud, and given grace to the humble. The moresimply dependent we are on the teaching, help, and blessing of the Sonof God, the more we shall know both of the Father and of the Son; themore blessed we shall be in seeing the glory, and hearing the words ofthe Divine Saviour; and the more useful we shall be made in promotinghis cause.
Luk 10:25-37	<br>If we speak of eternal life, and the way to it, in a careless manner,we take the name of God in vain. No one will ever love God and hisneighbour with any measure of pure, spiritual love, who is not made apartaker of converting grace. But the proud heart of man strives hardagainst these convictions. Christ gave an instance of a poor Jew indistress, relieved by a good Samaritan. This poor man fell amongthieves, who left him about to die of his wounds. He was slighted bythose who should have been his friends, and was cared for by astranger, a Samaritan, of the nation which the Jews most despised anddetested, and would have no dealings with. It is lamentable to observehow selfishness governs all ranks; how many excuses men will make toavoid trouble or expense in relieving others. But the true Christianhas the law of love written in his heart. The Spirit of Christ dwellsin him; Christ's image is renewed in his soul. The parable is abeautiful explanation of the law of loving our neighbour as ourselves,without regard to nation, party, or any other distinction. It also setsforth the kindness and love of God our Saviour toward sinful, miserablemen. We were like this poor, distressed traveller. Satan, our enemy,has robbed us, and wounded us: such is the mischief sin has done us.The blessed Jesus had compassion on us. The believer considers thatJesus loved him, and gave his life for him, when an enemy and a rebel;and having shown him mercy, he bids him go and do likewise. It is theduty of us all , in our places, and according to our ability, tosuccour, help, and relieve all that are in distress and necessity.
Luk 10:38-42	<br>A good sermon is not the worse for being preached in a house; and thevisits of our friends should be so managed, as to make them turn to thegood of their souls. Sitting at Christ's feet, signifies readiness toreceive his word, and submission to the guidance of it. Martha wasproviding for the entertainment of Christ, and those that came withhim. Here were respect to our Lord Jesus and right care of herhousehold affairs. But there was something to be blamed. She was formuch serving; plenty, variety, and exactness. Worldly business is asnare to us, when it hinders us from serving God, and getting good toour souls. What needless time is wasted, and expense often laid out,even in entertaining professors of the gospel! Though Martha was onthis occasion faulty, yet she was a true believer, and in her generalconduct did not neglect the one thing needful. The favour of God isneedful to our happiness; the salvation of Christ is needful to oursafety. Where this is attended to, all other things will be rightlypursued. Christ declared, Mary hath chosen the good part. For one thingis needful, this one thing that she has done, to give up herself to theguidance of Christ. The things of this life will be taken away from us,at the furthest, when we shall be taken away from them; but nothingshall separate from the love of Christ, and a part in that love. Menand devils cannot take it away from us, and God and Christ will not.Let us mind the one thing needful more diligently.
Luk 11:1-4	<br>"Lord, teach us to pray," is a good prayer, and a very needful one, forJesus Christ only can teach us, by his word and Spirit, how to pray.Lord, teach me what it is to pray; Lord, stir up and quicken me to theduty; Lord, direct me what to pray for; teach me what I should say.Christ taught them a prayer, much the same that he had given before inhis sermon upon the mount. There are some differences in the words ofthe Lord's prayer in Matthew and in Luke, but they are of no moment.Let us in our requests, both for others and for ourselves, come to ourheavenly Father, confiding in his power and goodness.
Luk 11:5-13	<br>Christ encourages fervency and constancy in prayer. We must come forwhat we need, as a man does to his neighbour or friend, who is kind tohim. We must come for bread; for that which is needful. If God does notanswer our prayers speedily, yet he will in due time, if we continue topray. Observe what to pray for; we must ask for the Holy Spirit, notonly as necessary in order to our praying well, but as all spiritualblessings are included in that one. For by the influences of the HolySpirit we are brought to know God and ourselves, to repent, believe in,and love Christ, and so are made comfortable in this world, and meetfor happiness in the next. All these blessings our heavenly Father ismore ready to bestow on every one that asks for them, than an indulgentparent is to give food to a hungry child. And this is the advantage ofthe prayer of faith, that it quiets and establishes the heart in God.
Luk 11:14-26	<br>Christ's thus casting out the devils, was really the destroying oftheir power. The heart of every unconverted sinner is the devil'spalace, where he dwells, and where he rules. There is a kind of peacein the heart of an unconverted soul, while the devil, as a strong manarmed, keeps it. The sinner is secure, has no doubt concerning thegoodness of his state, nor any dread of the judgment to come. Butobserve the wonderful change made in conversion. The conversion of asoul to God, is Christ's victory over the devil and his power in thatsoul, restoring the soul to its liberty, and recovering his owninterest in it and power over it. All the endowments of mind of bodyare now employed for Christ. Here is the condition of a hypocrite. Thehouse is swept from common sins, by a forced confession, as Pharaoh's;by a feigned contrition, as Ahab's; or by a partial reformation, asHerod's. The house is swept, but it is not washed; the heart is notmade holy. Sweeping takes off only the loose dirt, while the sin thatbesets the sinner, the beloved sin, is untouched. The house isgarnished with common gifts and graces. It is not furnished with anytrue grace; it is all paint and varnish, not real nor lasting. It wasnever given up to Christ, nor dwelt in by the Spirit. Let us take heedof resting in that which a man may have, and yet come short of heaven.The wicked spirits enter in without any difficulty; they are welcomed,and they dwell there; there they work, there they rule. From such anawful state let all earnestly pray to be delivered.
Luk 11:27,28	<br>While the scribes and Pharisees despised and blasphemed the discoursesof our Lord Jesus, this good woman admired them, and the wisdom andpower with which he spake. Christ led the woman to a higherconsideration. Though it is a great privilege to hear the word of God,yet those only are truly blessed, that is, blessed of the Lord, thathear it, keep it in memory, and keep to it as their way and rule.
Luk 11:29-36	<br>Christ promised that there should be one sign more given, even the signof Jonah the prophet; which in Matthew is explained, as meaning theresurrection of Christ; and he warned them to improve this sign. Butthough Christ himself were the constant preacher in any congregation,and worked miracles daily among them, yet unless his grace humbledtheir hearts, they would not profit by his word. Let us not desire moreevidence and fuller teaching than the Lord is pleased to afford us. Weshould pray without ceasing that our hearts and understandings may beopened, that we may profit by the light we enjoy. And especially takeheed that the light which is in us be not darkness; for if our leadingprinciples be wrong, our judgment and practice must become more so.
Luk 11:37-54	<br>We should all look to our hearts, that they may be cleansed andnew-created; and while we attend to the great things of the law and ofthe gospel, we must not neglect the smallest matter God has appointed.When any wait to catch something out of our mouths, that they mayinsnare us, O Lord, give us thy prudence and thy patience, anddisappoint their evil purposes. Furnish us with such meekness andpatience that we may glory in reproaches, for Christ's sake, and thatthy Holy Spirit may rest upon us.
Luk 12:1-12	<br>A firm belief of the doctrine of God's universal providence, and theextent of it, would satisfy us when in peril, and encourage us to trustGod in the way of duty. Providence takes notice of the meanestcreatures, even of the sparrows, and therefore of the smallestinterests of the disciples of Christ. Those who confess Christ now,shall be owned by him in the great day, before the angels of God. Todeter us from denying Christ, and deserting his truths and ways, we arehere assured that those who deny Christ, though they may thus save lifeitself, and though they may gain a kingdom by it, will be great losersat last; for Christ will not know them, will not own them, nor showthem favour. But let no trembling, penitent backslider doubt ofobtaining forgiveness. This is far different from the determined enmitythat is blasphemy against the Holy Ghost, which shall never beforgiven, because it will never be repented of.
Luk 12:13-21	<br>Christ's kingdom is spiritual, and not of this world. Christianity doesnot meddle with politics; it obliges all to do justly, but wordlydominion is not founded in grace. It does not encourage expectations ofworldly advantages by religion. The rewards of Christ's disciples areof another nature. Covetousness is a sin we need constantly to bewarned against; for happiness and comfort do not depend on the wealthof this world. The things of the world will not satisfy the desires ofa soul. Here is a parable, which shows the folly of carnal worldlingwhile they live, and their misery when they die. The character drawn isexactly that of a prudent, worldly man, who has no grateful regard tothe providence of God, nor any right thought of the uncertainty ofhuman affairs, the worth of his soul, or the importance of eternity.How many, even among professed Christians, point out similar charactersas models for imitation, and proper persons to form connexions with! Wemistake if we think that thoughts are hid, and thoughts are free. Whenhe saw a great crop upon his ground, instead of thanking God for it, orrejoicing to be able to do more good, he afflicts himself. What shall Ido now? The poorest beggar in the country could not have said a moreanxious word. The more men have, the more perplexity they have with it.It was folly for him to think of making no other use of his plenty,than to indulge the flesh and gratify the sensual appetites, withoutany thought of doing good to others. Carnal worldlings are fools; andthe day is coming when God will call them by their own name, and theywill call themselves so. The death of such persons is miserable initself, and terrible to them. Thy soul shall be required. He is loth topart with it; but God shall require it, shall require an account of it,require it as a guilty soul to be punished without delay. It is thefolly of most men, to mind and pursue that which is for the body andfor time only, more than that for the soul and eternity.
Luk 12:22-40	<br>Christ largely insisted upon this caution not to give way todisquieting, perplexing cares, Mt 6:25-34. The arguments here used arefor our encouragement to cast our care upon God, which is the right wayto get ease. As in our stature, so in our state, it is our wisdom totake it as it is. An eager, anxious pursuit of the things of thisworld, even necessary things, ill becomes the disciples of Christ.Fears must not prevail; when we frighten ourselves with thoughts ofevil to come, and put ourselves upon needless cares how to avoid it. Ifwe value the beauty of holiness, we shall not crave the luxuries oflife. Let us then examine whether we belong to this little flock.Christ is our Master, and we are his servants; not only workingservants, but waiting servants. We must be as men that wait for theirlord, that sit up while he stays out late, to be ready to receive him.In this Christ alluded to his own ascension to heaven, his coming tocall his people to him by death, and his return to judge the world. Weare uncertain as to the time of his coming to us, we should thereforebe always ready. If men thus take care of their houses, let us be thuswise for our souls. Be ye therefore ready also; as ready as the goodman of the house would be, if he knew at what hour the thief wouldcome.
Luk 12:41-53	<br>All are to take to themselves what Christ says in his word, and toinquire concerning it. No one is left so ignorant as not to know manythings to be wrong which he does, and many things to be right which heneglects; therefore all are without excuse in their sin. The bringingin the gospel dispensation would occasion desolations. Not that thiswould be the tendency of Christ's religion, which is pure, peaceable,and loving; but the effect of its being contrary to men's pride andlusts. There was to be a wide publication of the gospel. But beforethat took place, Christ had a baptism to be baptized with, fardifferent from that of water and the Holy Spirit. He must enduresufferings and death. It agreed not with his plan to preach the gospelmore widely, till this baptism was completed. We should be zealous inmaking known the truth, for though divisions will be stirred up, and aman's own household may be his foes, yet sinners will be converted, andGod will be glorified.
Luk 12:54-59	<br>Christ would have the people to be as wise in the concerns of theirsouls as they are in outward affairs. Let them hasten to obtain peacewith God before it is too late. If any man has found that God has sethimself against him concerning his sins, let him apply to him as God inChrist reconciling the world to himself. While we are alive, we are inthe way, and now is our time.
Luk 13:1-5	<br>Mention was made to Christ of the death of some Galileans. Thistragical story is briefly related here, and is not met with in anyhistorians. In Christ's reply he spoke of another event, which, likeit, gave an instance of people taken away by sudden death. Towers, thatare built for safety, often prove to be men's destruction. He cautionedhis hearers not to blame great sufferers, as if they were therefore tobe accounted great sinners. As no place or employment can secure fromthe stroke of death, we should consider the sudden removals of othersas warnings to ourselves. On these accounts Christ founded a call torepentance. The same Jesus that bids us repent, for the kingdom ofheaven is at hand, bids us repent, for otherwise we shall perish.
Luk 13:6-9	<br>This parable of the barren fig-tree is intended to enforce the warninggiven just before: the barren tree, except it brings forth fruit, willbe cut down. This parable in the first place refers to the nation andpeople of the Jews. Yet it is, without doubt, for awakening all thatenjoy the means of grace, and the privileges of the visible church.When God has borne long, we may hope that he will bear with us yet alittle longer, but we cannot expect that he will bear always.
Luk 13:10-17	<br>Our Lord Jesus attended upon public worship on the sabbaths. Evenbodily infirmities, unless very grievous, should not keep us frompublic worship on sabbath days. This woman came to Christ to be taught,and to get good to her soul, and then he relieved her bodily infirmity.This cure represents the work of Christ's grace upon the soul. And whencrooked souls are made straight, they will show it by glorifying God.Christ knew that this ruler had a real enmity to him and to his gospel,and that he did but cloak it with a pretended zeal for the sabbath day;he really would not have them be healed any day; but if Jesus speaksthe word, and puts forth his healing power, sinners are set free. Thisdeliverance is often wrought on the Lord's day; and whatever labourtends to put men in the way of receiving the blessing, agrees with thedesign of that day.
Luk 13:18-22	<br>Here is the progress of the gospel foretold in two parables, as in Mt13. The kingdom of the Messiah is the kingdom of God. May grace grow inour hearts; may our faith and love grow exceedingly, so as to giveundoubted evidence of their reality. May the example of God's saints beblessed to those among whom they live; and may his grace flow fromheart to heart, until the little one becomes a thousand.
Luk 13:23-30	<br>Our Saviour came to guide men's consciences, not to gratify theircuriosity. Ask not, How many shall be saved? But, Shall I be one ofthem? Not, What shall become of such and such? But, What shall I do,and what will become of me? Strive to enter in at the strait gate. Thisis directed to each of us; it is, Strive ye. All that will be saved,must enter in at the strait gate, must undergo a change of the wholeman. Those that would enter in, must strive to enter. Here areawakening considerations, to enforce this exhortation. Oh that we maybe all awakened by them! They answer the question, Are there few thatshall be saved? But let none despond either as to themselves or others,for there are last who shall be first, and first who shall be last. Ifwe reach heaven, we shall meet many there whom we little thought tomeet, and miss many whom we expected to find.
Luk 13:31-35	<br>Christ, in calling Herod a fox, gave him his true character. Thegreatest of men were accountable to God, therefore it became him tocall this proud king by his own name; but it is not an example for us.I know, said our Lord, that I must die very shortly; when I die, Ishall be perfected, I shall have completed my undertaking. It is goodfor us to look upon the time we have before us as but little, that wemay thereby be quickened to do the work of the day in its day. Thewickedness of persons and places which more than others professreligion and relation to God, especially displeases and grieves theLord Jesus. The judgment of the great day will convince unbelievers;but let us learn thankfully to welcome, and to profit by all who comein the name of the Lord, to call us to partake of his great salvation.
Luk 14:1-6	<br>This Pharisee, as well as others, seems to have had an ill design inentertaining Jesus at his house. But our Lord would not be hinderedfrom healing a man, though he knew a clamour would be raised at hisdoing it on the sabbath. It requires care to understand the properconnexion between piety and charity in observing the sabbath, and thedistinction between works of real necessity and habits ofself-indulgence. Wisdom from above, teaches patient perseverance inwell-doing.
Luk 14:7-14	<br>Even in the common actions of life, Christ marks what we do, not onlyin our religious assemblies, but at our tables. We see in many cases,that a man's pride will bring him low, and before honour is humility.Our Saviour here teaches, that works of charity are better than worksof show. But our Lord did not mean that a proud and unbelievingliberality should be rewarded, but that his precept of doing good tothe poor and afflicted should be observed from love to him.
Luk 14:15-24	<br>In this parable observe the free grace and mercy of God shining in thegospel of Christ, which will be food and a feast for the soul of a manthat knows its own wants and miseries. All found some pretence to putoff their attendance. This reproves the Jewish nation for their neglectof the offers of Christ's grace. It shows also the backwardness thereis to close with the gospel call. The want of gratitude in those whoslight gospel offers, and the contempt put upon the God of heaventhereby, justly provoke him. The apostles were to turn to the Gentiles,when the Jews refused the offer; and with them the church was filled.The provision made for precious souls in the gospel of Christ, has notbeen made in vain; for if some reject, others will thankfully acceptthe offer. The very poor and low in the world, shall be as welcome toChrist as the rich and great; and many times the gospel has thegreatest success among those that labour under worldly disadvantagesand bodily infirmities. Christ's house shall at last be filled; it willbe so when the number of the elect is completed.
Luk 14:25-35	<br>Though the disciples of Christ are not all crucified, yet they all beartheir cross, and must bear it in the way of duty. Jesus bids them countupon it, and then consider of it. Our Saviour explains this by twosimilitudes; the former showing that we must consider the expenses ofour religion; the latter, that we must consider the perils of it. Sitdown and count the cost; consider it will cost the mortifying of sin,even the most beloved lusts. The proudest and most daring sinner cannotstand against God, for who knows the power of his anger? It is ourinterest to seek peace with him, and we need not send to ask conditionsof peace, they are offered to us, and are highly to our advantage. Insome way a disciple of Christ will be put to the trial. May we seek tobe disciples indeed, and be careful not to grow slack in ourprofession, or afraid of the cross; that we may be the good salt of theearth, to season those around us with the savour of Christ.
Luk 15:1-10	<br>The parable of the lost sheep is very applicable to the great work ofman's redemption. The lost sheep represents the sinner as departed fromGod, and exposed to certain ruin if not brought back to him, yet notdesirous to return. Christ is earnest in bringing sinners home. In theparable of the lost piece of silver, that which is lost, is one piece,of small value compared with the rest. Yet the woman seeks diligentlytill she finds it. This represents the various means and methods Godmakes use of to bring lost souls home to himself, and the Saviour's joyon their return to him. How careful then should we be that ourrepentance is unto salvation!
Luk 15:11-16	<br>The parable of the prodigal son shows the nature of repentance, and theLord's readiness to welcome and bless all who return to him. It fullysets forth the riches of gospel grace; and it has been, and will be,while the world stands, of unspeakable use to poor sinners, to directand to encourage them in repenting and returning to God. It is bad, andthe beginning of worse, when men look upon God's gifts as debts due tothem. The great folly of sinners, and that which ruins them, is, beingcontent in their life-time to receive their good things. Our firstparents ruined themselves and all their race, by a foolish ambition tobe independent, and this is at the bottom of sinners' persisting intheir sin. We may all discern some features of our own characters inthat of the prodigal son. A sinful state is of departure and distancefrom God. A sinful state is a spending state: wilful sinners misemploytheir thoughts and the powers of their souls, mispend their time andall their opportunities. A sinful state is a wanting state. Sinnerswant necessaries for their souls; they have neither food nor raimentfor them, nor any provision for hereafter. A sinful state is a vile,slavish state. The business of the devil's servants is to makeprovision for the flesh, to fulfil the lusts thereof, and that is nobetter than feeding swine. A sinful state is a state constantdiscontent. The wealth of the world and the pleasures of the senseswill not even satisfy our bodies; but what are they to precious souls!A sinful state is a state which cannot look for relief from anycreature. In vain do we cry to the world and to the flesh; they havethat which will poison a soul, but have nothing to give which will feedand nourish it. A sinful state is a state of death. A sinner is dead intrespasses and sins, destitute of spiritual life. A sinful state is alost state. Souls that are separated from God, if his mercy preventnot, will soon be lost for ever. The prodigal's wretched state, onlyfaintly shadows forth the awful ruin of man by sin. Yet how few aresensible of their own state and character!
Luk 15:17-24	<br>Having viewed the prodigal in his abject state of misery, we are nextto consider his recovery from it. This begins by his coming to himself.That is a turning point in the sinner's conversion. The Lord opens hiseyes, and convinces him of sin; then he views himself and every object,in a different light from what he did before. Thus the convinced sinnerperceives that the meanest servant of God is happier than he is. Tolook unto God as a Father, and our Father, will be of great use in ourrepentance and return to him. The prodigal arose, nor stopped till hereached his home. Thus the repenting sinner resolutely quits thebondage of Satan and his lusts, and returns to God by prayer,notwithstanding fears and discouragements. The Lord meets him withunexpected tokens of his forgiving love. Again; the reception of thehumbled sinner is like that of the prodigal. He is clothed in the robeof the Redeemer's righteousness, made partaker of the Spirit ofadoption, prepared by peace of conscience and gospel grace to walk inthe ways of holiness, and feasted with Divine consolations. Principlesof grace and holiness are wrought in him, to do, as well as to will.
Luk 15:25-32	<br>In the latter part of this parable we have the character of thePharisees, though not of them alone. It sets forth the kindness of theLord, and the proud manner in which his gracious kindness is oftenreceived. The Jews, in general, showed the same spirit towards theconverted Gentiles; and numbers in every age object to the gospel andits preachers, on the same ground. What must that temper be, whichstirs up a man to despise and abhor those for whom the Saviour shed hisprecious blood, who are objects of the Father's choice, and temples ofthe Holy Ghost! This springs from pride, self-preference, and ignoranceof a man's own heart. The mercy and grace of our God in Christ, shinealmost as bright in his tender and gentle bearing with peevish saints,as his receiving prodigal sinners upon their repentance. It is theunspeakable happiness of all the children of God, who keep close totheir Father's house, that they are, and shall be ever with him. Happywill it be for those who thankfully accept Christ's invitation.
Luk 16:1-12	<br>Whatever we have, the property of it is God's; we have only the use ofit, according to the direction of our great Lord, and for his honour.This steward wasted his lord's goods. And we are all liable to the samecharge; we have not made due improvement of what God has trusted uswith. The steward cannot deny it; he must make up his accounts, and begone. This may teach us that death will come, and deprive us of theopportunities we now have. The steward will make friends of his lord'sdebtors or tenants, by striking off a considerable part of their debtto his lord. The lord referred to in this parable commended not thefraud, but the policy of the steward. In that respect alone is it sonoticed. Worldly men, in the choice of their object, are foolish; butin their activity, and perseverance, they are often wiser thanbelievers. The unjust steward is not set before us as an example incheating his master, or to justify any dishonesty, but to point out thecareful ways of worldly men. It would be well if the children of lightwould learn wisdom from the men of the world, and would as earnestlypursue their better object. The true riches signify spiritualblessings; and if a man spends upon himself, or hoards up what God hastrusted to him, as to outward things, what evidence can he have, thathe is an heir of God through Christ? The riches of this world aredeceitful and uncertain. Let us be convinced that those are truly rich,and very rich, who are rich in faith, and rich toward God, rich inChrist, in the promises; let us then lay up our treasure in heaven, andexpect our portion from thence.
Luk 16:13-18	<br>To this parable our Lord added a solemn warning. Ye cannot serve Godand the world, so divided are the two interests. When our Lord spokethus, the covetous Pharisees treated his instructions with contempt.But he warned them, that what they contended for as the law, was awresting of its meaning: this our Lord showed in a case respectingdivorce. There are many covetous sticklers for the forms of godliness,who are the bitterest enemies to its power, and try to set othersagainst the truth.
Luk 16:19-31	<br>Here the spiritual things are represented, in a description of thedifferent state of good and bad, in this world and in the other. We arenot told that the rich man got his estate by fraud, or oppression; butChrist shows, that a man may have a great deal of the wealth, pomp, andpleasure of this world, yet perish for ever under God's wrath andcurse. The sin of this rich man was his providing for himself only.Here is a godly man, and one that will hereafter be happy for ever, inthe depth of adversity and distress. It is often the lot of some of thedearest of God's saints and servants to be greatly afflicted in thisworld. We are not told that the rich man did him any harm, but we donot find that he had any care for him. Here is the different conditionof this godly poor man, and this wicked rich man, at and after death.The rich man in hell lifted up his eyes, being in torment. It is notprobable that there are discourses between glorified saints and damnedsinners, but this dialogue shows the hopeless misery and fruitlessdesires, to which condemned spirits are brought. There is a day coming,when those who now hate and despise the people of God, would gladlyreceive kindness from them. But the damned in hell shall not have theleast abatement of their torment. Sinners are now called upon toremember; but they do not, they will not, they find ways to avoid it.As wicked people have good things only in this life, and at death arefor ever separated from all good, so godly people have evil things onlyin this life, and at death they are for ever put from them. In thisworld, blessed be God, there is no gulf between a state of nature andgrace, we may pass from sin to God; but if we die in our sins, there isno coming out. The rich man had five brethren, and would have themstopped in their sinful course; their coming to that place of torment,would make his misery the worse, who had helped to show them the waythither. How many would now desire to recall or to undo what they havewritten or done! Those who would make the rich man's praying to Abrahamjustify praying to saints departed, go far to seek for proofs, when themistake of a damned sinner is all they can find for an example. Andsurely there is no encouragement to follow the example, when all hisprayers were made in vain. A messenger from the dead could say no morethan what is said in the Scriptures. The same strength of corruptionthat breaks through the convictions of the written word, would triumphover a witness from the dead. Let us seek to the law and to thetestimony, Isa 8:19,20, for that is the sure word of prophecy, uponwhich we may rest, 2Pe 1:19. Circumstances in every age show that noterrors, or arguments, can give true repentance without the specialgrace of God renewing the sinner's heart.
Luk 17:1-10	<br>It is no abatement of their guilt by whom an offence comes, nor will itlessen their punishment that offences will come. Faith in God'spardoning mercy, will enable us to get over the greatest difficultiesin the way of forgiving our brethren. As with God nothing isimpossible, so all things are possible to him that can believe. OurLord showed his disciples their need of deep humility. The Lord hassuch a property in every creature, as no man can have in another; hecannot be in debt to them for their services, nor do they deserve anyreturn from him.
Luk 17:11-19	<br>A sense of our spiritual leprosy should make us very humble whenever wedraw near to Christ. It is enough to refer ourselves to the compassionsof Christ, for they fail not. We may look for God to meet us withmercy, when we are found in the way of obedience. Only one of those whowere healed returned to give thanks. It becomes us, like him, to bevery humble in thanksgivings, as well as in prayers. Christ noticed theone who thus distinguished himself, he was a Samaritan. The others onlygot the outward cure, he alone got the spiritual blessing.
Luk 17:20-37	<br>The kingdom of God was among the Jews, or rather within some of them.It was a spiritual kingdom, set up in the heart by the power of Divinegrace. Observe how it had been with sinners formerly, and in what statethe judgments of God, which they had been warned of, found them. Hereis shown what a dreadful surprise this destruction will be to thesecure and sensual. Thus shall it be in the day when the Son of man isrevealed. When Christ came to destroy the Jewish nation by the Romanarmies, that nation was found in such a state of false security as ishere spoken of. In like manner, when Jesus Christ shall come to judgethe world, sinners will be found altogether regardless; for in likemanner the sinners of every age go on securely in their evil ways, andremember not their latter end. But wherever the wicked are, who aremarked for eternal ruin, they shall be found by the judgments of God.
Luk 18:1-8	<br>All God's people are praying people. Here earnest steadiness in prayerfor spiritual mercies is taught. The widow's earnestness prevailed evenwith the unjust judge: she might fear lest it should set him moreagainst her; but our earnest prayer is pleasing to our God. Even to theend there will still be ground for the same complaint of weakness offaith.
Luk 18:9-14	<br>This parable was to convince some who trusted in themselves that theywere righteous, and despised others. God sees with what disposition anddesign we come to him in holy ordinances. What the Pharisee said, showsthat he trusted to himself that he was righteous. We may suppose he wasfree from gross and scandalous sins. All this was very well andcommendable. Miserable is the condition of those who come short of therighteousness of this Pharisee, yet he was not accepted; and why not?He went up to the temple to pray, but was full of himself and his owngoodness; the favour and grace of God he did not think worth asking.Let us beware of presenting proud devotions to the Lord, and ofdespising others. The publican's address to God was full of humility,and of repentance for sin, and desire toward God. His prayer was short,but to the purpose; God be merciful to me a sinner. Blessed be God,that we have this short prayer upon record, as an answered prayer; andthat we are sure that he who prayed it, went to his house justified;for so shall we be, if we pray it, as he did, through Jesus Christ. Heowned himself a sinner by nature, by practice, guilty before God. Hehad no dependence but upon the mercy of God; upon that alone he relied.And God's glory is to resist the proud, and give grace to the humble.Justification is of God in Christ; therefore the self-condemned, andnot the self-righteous, are justified before God.
Luk 18:15-17	<br>None are too little, too young, to be brought to Christ, who knows howto show kindness to those not capable of doing service to him. It isthe mind of Christ, that little children should be brought to him. Thepromise is to us, and to our seed; therefore He will bid them welcometo him with us. And we must receive his kingdom as children, not bypurchase, and must call it our Father's gift.
Luk 18:18-30	<br>Many have a great deal in them very commendable, yet perish for lack ofsome one thing; so this ruler could not bear Christ's terms, whichwould part between him and his estate. Many who are loth to leaveChrist, yet do leave him. After a long struggle between theirconvictions and their corruptions, their corruptions carry the day.They are very sorry that they cannot serve both; but if one must bequitted, it shall be their God, not their wordly gain. Their boastedobedience will be found mere outside show; the love of the world insome form or other lies at the root. Men are apt to speak too much ofwhat they have left and lost, of what they have done and suffered forChrist, as Peter did. But we should rather be ashamed that there hasbeen any regret or difficulty in doing it.
Luk 18:31-34	<br>The Spirit of Christ, in the Old Testament prophets, testifiedbeforehand his sufferings, and the glory that should follow, 1Pe 1:11.The disciples' prejudices were so strong, that they would notunderstand these things literally. They were so intent upon theprophecies which spake of Christ's glory, that they overlooked thosewhich spake of his sufferings. People run into mistakes, because theyread their Bibles by halves, and are only for the smooth things. We areas backward to learn the proper lessons from the sufferings,crucifixion, and resurrection of Christ, as the disciples were to whathe told them as to those events; and for the same reason; self-love,and a desire of worldly objects, close our understandings.
Luk 18:35-43	<br>This poor blind man sat by the wayside, begging. He was not only blind,but poor, the fitter emblem of the world of mankind which Christ cameto heal and save. The prayer of faith, guided by Christ's encouragingpromises, and grounded on them, shall not be in vain. The grace ofChrist ought to be thankfully acknowledged, to the glory of God. It isfor the glory of God if we follow Jesus, as those will do whose eyesare opened. We must praise God for his mercies to others, as well asfor mercies to ourselves. Would we rightly understand these things, wemust come to Christ, like the blind man, earnestly beseeching him toopen our eyes, and to show us clearly the excellence of his precepts,and the value of his salvation.
Luk 19:1-10	<br>Those who sincerely desire a sight of Christ, like Zaccheus, will breakthrough opposition, and take pains to see him. Christ invited himselfto Zaccheus' house. Wherever Christ comes he opens the heart, andinclines it to receive him. He that has a mind to know Christ, shall beknown of him. Those whom Christ calls, must humble themselves, and comedown. We may well receive him joyfully, who brings all good with him.Zaccheus gave proofs publicly that he was become a true convert. Hedoes not look to be justified by his works, as the Pharisee; but by hisgood works he will, through the grace of God, show the sincerity of hisfaith and repentance. Zaccheus is declared to be a happy man, now he isturned from sin to God. Now that he is saved from his sins, from theguilt of them, from the power of them, all the benefits of salvationare his. Christ is come to his house, and where Christ comes he bringssalvation with him. He came into this lost world to seek and to saveit. His design was to save, when there was no salvation in any other.He seeks those that sought him not, and asked not for him.
Luk 19:11-27	<br>This parable is like that of the talents, Mt 25. Those that are calledto Christ, he furnishes with gifts needful for their business; and fromthose to whom he gives power, he expects service. The manifestation ofthe Spirit is given to every man to profit withal, 1Co 12:7. And asevery one has received the gift, so let him minister the same, 1Pe4:10. The account required, resembles that in the parable of thetalents; and the punishment of the avowed enemies of Christ, as well asof false professors, is shown. The principal difference is, that thepound given to each seems to point out the gift of the gospel, which isthe same to all who hear it; but the talents, distributed more or less,seem to mean that God gives different capacities and advantages to men,by which this one gift of the gospel may be differently improved.
Luk 19:28-40	<br>Christ has dominion over all creatures, and may use them as he pleases.He has all men's hearts both under his eye and in his hand. Christ'striumphs, and his disciples' joyful praises, vex proud Pharisees, whoare enemies to him and to his kingdom. But Christ, as he despises thecontempt of the proud, so he accepts the praises of the humble.Pharisees would silence the praises of Christ, but they cannot; for asGod can out of stones raise up children unto Abraham, and turn thestony heart to himself, so he can bring praise out of the mouths ofchildren. And what will be the feelings of men when the Lord returns inglory to judge the world!
Luk 19:41-48	<br>Who can behold the holy Jesus, looking forward to the miseries thatawaited his murderers, weeping over the city where his precious bloodwas about to be shed, without seeing that the likeness of God in thebeliever, consists much in good-will and compassion? Surely thosecannot be right who take up any doctrines of truth, so as to behardened towards their fellow-sinners. But let every one remember, thatthough Jesus wept over Jerusalem, he executed awful vengeance upon it.Though he delights not in the death of a sinner, yet he will surelybring to pass his awful threatenings on those who neglect hissalvation. The Son of God did not weep vain and causeless tears, norfor a light matter, nor for himself. He knows the value of souls, theweight of guilt, and how low it will press and sink mankind. May hethen come and cleanse our hearts by his Spirit, from all that defiles.May sinners, on every side, become attentive to the words of truth andsalvation.
Luk 20:1-8	<br>Men often pretend to examine the evidences of revelation, and the truthof the gospel, when only seeking excuses for their own unbelief anddisobedience. Christ answered these priests and scribes with a plainquestion about the baptism of John, which the common people couldanswer. They all knew it was from heaven, nothing in it had an earthlytendency. Those that bury the knowledge they have, are justly deniedfurther knowledge. It was just with Christ to refuse to give account ofhis authority, to those who knew the baptism of John to be from heaven,yet would not believe in him, nor own their knowledge.
Luk 20:9-19	<br>Christ spake this parable against those who resolved not to own hisauthority, though the evidence of it was so full. How many resemble theJews who murdered the prophets and crucified Christ, in their enmity toGod, and aversion to his service, desiring to live according to theirlusts, without control! Let all who are favoured with God's word, lookto it that they make proper use of their advantages. Awful will be thedoom, both of those who reject the Son, and of those who profess toreverence Him, yet render not the fruits in due season. Though theycould not but own that for such a sin, such a punishment was just, yetthey could not bear to hear of it. It is the folly of sinners, thatthey persevere in sinful ways, though they dread the destruction at theend of those ways.
Luk 20:20-26	<br>Those who are most crafty in their designs against Christ and hisgospel, cannot hide them. He did not give a direct answer, but reprovedthem for offering to impose upon him; and they could not fasten uponany thing wherewith to stir up either the governor or the peopleagainst him. The wisdom which is from above, will direct all who teachthe way of God truly, to avoid the snares laid for them by wicked men;and will teach our duty to God, to our rulers, and to all men, soclearly, that opposers will have no evil to say of us.
Luk 20:27-38	<br>It is common for those who design to undermine any truth of God, toload it with difficulties. But we wrong ourselves, and wrong the truthof Christ, when we form our notions of the world of spirits by thisworld of sense. There are more worlds than one; a present visibleworld, and a future unseen world; and let every one compare this worldand that world, and give the preference in his thoughts and cares tothat which deserves them. Believers shall obtain the resurrection fromthe dead, that is the blessed resurrection. What shall be the happystate of the inhabitants of that world, we cannot express or conceive,1Co 2:9. Those that are entered into the joy of their Lord, areentirely taken up therewith; when there is perfection of holiness therewill be no occasion for preservatives from sin. And when God calledhimself the God of these patriarchs, he meant that he was a Godall-sufficient to them, Ge 17:1, their exceeding great Reward, Ge 15:1.He never did that for them in this world, which answered the fullextent of his undertaking; therefore there must be another life, inwhich he will do that for them, which will completely fulfil thepromise.
Luk 20:39-47	<br>The scribes commended the reply Christ made to the Sadducees about theresurrection, but they were silenced by a question concerning theMessiah. Christ, as God, was David's Lord; but Christ, as man, wasDavid's son. The scribes would receive the severest judgement fordefrauding the poor widows, and for their abuse of religion,particularly of prayer, which they used as a pretence for carrying onworldly and wicked plans. Dissembled piety is double sin. Then let usbeg of God to keep us from pride, ambition, covetousness, and everyevil thing; and to teach us to seek that honour which comes from himalone.
Luk 21:1-4	<br>From the offering of this poor widow, learn that what we rightly givefor the relief of the poor, and the support of God's worship, is givenunto God; and our Saviour sees with pleasure whatever we have in ourhearts to give for the relief of his members, or for his service.Blessed Lord! the poorest of thy servants have two mites, they have asoul and a body; persuade and enable us to offer both unto thee; howhappy shall we be in thine accepting of them!
Luk 21:5-28	<br>With much curiosity those about Christ ask as to the time when thegreat desolation should be. He answers with clearness and fulness, asfar as was necessary to teach them their duty; for all knowledge isdesirable as far as it is in order to practice. Though spiritualjudgements are the most common in gospel times, yet God makes use oftemporal judgments also. Christ tells them what hard things they shouldsuffer for his name's sake, and encourages them to bear up under theirtrials, and to go on in their work, notwithstanding the opposition theywould meet with. God will stand by you, and own you, and assist you.This was remarkably fulfilled after the pouring out of the Spirit, bywhom Christ gave his disciples wisdom and utterance. Though we may belosers for Christ, we shall not, we cannot be losers by him, in theend. It is our duty and interest at all times, especially in perilous,trying times, to secure the safety of our own souls. It is by Christianpatience we keep possession of our own souls, and keep out all thoseimpressions which would put us out of temper. We may view the prophecybefore us much as those Old Testament prophecies, which, together withtheir great object, embrace, or glance at some nearer object ofimportance to the church. Having given an idea of the times for aboutthirty-eight years next to come, Christ shows what all those thingswould end in, namely, the destruction of Jerusalem, and the utterdispersion of the Jewish nation; which would be a type and figure ofChrist's second coming. The scattered Jews around us preach the truthof Christianity; and prove, that though heaven and earth shall passaway, the words of Jesus shall not pass away. They also remind us topray for those times when neither the real, nor the spiritualJerusalem, shall any longer be trodden down by the Gentiles, and whenboth Jews and Gentiles shall be turned to the Lord. When Christ came todestroy the Jews, he came to redeem the Christians that were persecutedand oppressed by them; and then had the churches rest. When he comes tojudge the world, he will redeem all that are his from their troubles.So fully did the Divine judgements come upon the Jews, that their cityis set as an example before us, to show that sins will not passunpunished; and that the terrors of the Lord, and his threateningsagainst impenitent sinners, will all come to pass, even as his word wastrue, and his wrath great upon Jerusalem.
Luk 21:29-38	<br>Christ tells his disciples to observe the signs of the times, whichthey might judge by. He charges them to look upon the ruin of theJewish nation as near. Yet this race and family of Abraham shall not berooted out; it shall survive as a nation, and be found as prophesied,when the Son of man shall be revealed. He cautions them against beingsecure and sensual. This command is given to all Christ's disciples,Take heed to yourselves, that ye be not overpowered by temptations, norbetrayed by your own corruptions. We cannot be safe, if we are carnallysecure. Our danger is, lest the day of death and of judgment shouldcome upon us when we are not prepared. Lest, when we are called to meetour Lord, that be the furthest from our thoughts, which ought to benearest our hearts. For so it will come upon the most of men, who dwellupon the earth, and mind earthly things only, and have no converse withheaven. It will be a terror and a destruction to them. Here see whatshould be our aim, that we may be accounted worthy to escape all thosethings; that when the judgements of God are abroad, we may not be inthe common calamity, or it may not be that to us which it is to others.Do you ask how you may be found worthy to stand before Christ at thatday? Those who never yet sought Christ, let them now go unto him; thosewho never yet were humbled for their sins, let them now begin; thosewho have already begun, let them go forward and be kept humbled. Watchtherefore, and pray always. Watch against sin; watch in every duty, andmake the most of every opportunity to do good. Pray always: those shallbe accounted worthy to live a life of praise in the other world, wholive a life of prayer in this world. May we begin, employ, and concludeeach day attending to Christ's word, obeying his precepts, andfollowing his example, that whenever he comes we may be found watching.
Luk 22:1-6	<br>Christ knew all men, and had wise and holy ends in taking Judas to be adisciple. How he who knew Christ so well, came to betray him, we arehere told; Satan entered into Judas. It is hard to say whether moremischief is done to Christ's kingdom, by the power of its open enemies,or by the treachery of its pretended friends; but without the latter,its enemies could not do so much evil as they do.
Luk 22:7-18	<br>Christ kept the ordinances of the law, particularly that of thepassover, to teach us to observe his gospel institutions, and most ofall that of the Lord's supper. Those who go upon Christ's word, neednot fear disappointment. According to the orders given them, thedisciples got all ready for the passover. Jesus bids this passoverwelcome. He desired it, though he knew his sufferings would follow,because it was in order to his Father's glory and man's redemption. Hetakes his leave of all passovers, signifying thereby his doing away allthe ordinances of the ceremonial law, of which the passover was one ofthe earliest and chief. That type was laid aside, because now in thekingdom of God the substance was come.
Luk 22:19,20	<br>The Lord's supper is a sign or memorial of Christ already come, who bydying delivered us; his death is in special manner set before us inthat ordinance, by which we are reminded of it. The breaking ofChrist's body as a sacrifice for us, is therein brought to ourremembrance by the breaking of bread. Nothing can be more nourishingand satisfying to the soul, than the doctrine of Christ's makingatonement for sin, and the assurance of an interest in that atonement.Therefore we do this in rememberance of what He did for us, when hedied for us; and for a memorial of what we do, in joining ourselves tohim in an everlasting covenant. The shedding of Christ's blood, bywhich the atonement was made, is represented by the wine in the cup.
Luk 22:21-38	<br>How unbecoming is the worldly ambition of being the greatest, to thecharacter of a follower of Jesus, who took upon him the form of aservant, and humbled himself to the death of the cross! In the way toeternal happiness, we must expect to be assaulted and sifted by Satan.If he cannot destroy, he will try to disgrace or distress us. Nothingmore certainly forebodes a fall, in a professed follower of Christ,than self-confidence, with disregard to warnings, and contempt ofdanger. Unless we watch and pray always, we may be drawn in the courseof the day into those sins which we were in the morning most resolvedagainst. If believers were left to themselves, they would fall; butthey are kept by the power of God, and the prayer of Christ. Our Lordgave notice of a very great change of circumstances now approaching.The disciples must not expect that their friends would be kind to themas they had been. Therefore, he that has a purse, let him take it, forhe may need it. They must now expect that their enemies would be morefierce than they had been, and they would need weapons. At the time theapostles understood Christ to mean real weapons, but he spake only ofthe weapons of the spiritual warfare. The sword of the Spirit is thesword with which the disciples of Christ must furnish themselves.
Luk 22:39-46	<br>Every description which the evangelists give of the state of mind inwhich our Lord entered upon this conflict, proves the tremendous natureof the assault, and the perfect foreknowledge of its terrors possessedby the meek and lowly Jesus. Here are three things not in the otherevangelists. 1. When Christ was in his agony, there appeared to him anangel from heaven, strengthening him. It was a part of his humiliationthat he was thus strengthened by a ministering spirit. 2. Being inagony, he prayed more earnestly. Prayer, though never out of season, isin a special manner seasonable when we are in an agony. 3. In thisagony his sweat was as it were great drops of blood falling down. Thisshowed the travail of his soul. We should pray also to be enabled toresist unto the shedding of our blood, striving against sin, if evercalled to it. When next you dwell in imagination upon the delights ofsome favourite sin, think of its effects as you behold them here! Seeits fearful effects in the garden of Gethsemane, and desire, by thehelp of God, deeply to hate and to forsake that enemy, to ransomsinners from whom the Redeemer prayed, agonized, and bled.
Luk 22:47-53	<br>Nothing can be a greater affront or grief to the Lord Jesus, than to bebetrayed by those who profess to be his followers, and say that theylove him. Many instances there are, of Christ's being betrayed by thosewho, under the form of godliness, fight against the power of it. Jesushere gave an illustrious example of his own rule of doing good to thosethat hate us, as afterwards he did of praying for those thatdespitefully use us. Corrupt nature warps our conduct to extremes; weshould seek for the Lord's direction before we act in difficultcircumstances. Christ was willing to wait for his triumphs till hiswarfare was accomplished, and we must be so too. But the hour and thepower of darkness were short, and such the triumphs of the wickedalways will be.
Luk 22:54-62	<br>Peter's fall was his denying that he knew Christ, and was his disciple;disowning him because of distress and danger. He that has once told alie, is strongly tempted to persist: the beginning of that sin, likestrife, is as the letting forth of water. The Lord turned and lookedupon Peter. 1. It was a convincing look. Jesus turned and looked uponhim, as if he should say, Dost thou not know me, Peter? 2. It was achiding look. Let us think with what a rebuking countenance Christ mayjustly look upon us when we have sinned. 3. It was an expostulatinglook. Thou who wast the most forward to confess me to be the Son ofGod, and didst solemnly promise thou wouldest never disown me! 4. Itwas a compassionate look. Peter, how art thou fallen and undone if I donot help thee! 5. It was a directing look, to go and bethink himself.6. It was a significant look; it signified the conveying of grace toPeter's heart, to enable him to repent. The grace of God works in andby the word of God, brings that to mind, and sets that home upon theconscience, and so gives the soul the happy turn. Christ looked uponthe chief priests, and made no impression upon them as he did on Peter.It was not the mere look from Christ, but the Divine grace with it,that restored Peter.
Luk 22:63-71	<br>Those that condemned Jesus for a blasphemer, were the vilestblasphemers. He referred them to his second coming, for the full proofof his being the Christ, to their confusion, since they would not admitthe proof of it to their conviction. He owns himself to be the Son ofGod, though he knew he should suffer for it. Upon this they ground hiscondemnation. Their eyes being blinded, they rush on. Let us meditateon this amazing transaction, and consider Him who endured suchcontradiction of sinners against himself.
Luk 23:1-5	<br>Pilate well understood the difference between armed forces and ourLord's followers. But instead of being softened by Pilate's declarationof his innocence, and considering whether they were not bringing theguilt of innocent blood upon themselves, the Jews were the more angry.The Lord brings his designs to a glorious end, even by means of thosewho follow the devices of their own hearts. Thus all parties joined, soas to prove the innocence of Jesus, who was the atoning sacrifice forour sins.
Luk 23:6-12	<br>Herod had heard many things of Jesus in Galilee, and out of curiositylonged to see him. The poorest beggar that asked a miracle for therelief of his necessity, was never denied; but this proud prince, whoasked for a miracle only to gratify his curiosity, is refused. He mighthave seen Christ and his wondrous works in Galilee, and would not,therefore it is justly said, Now he would see them, and shall not.Herod sent Christ again to Pilate: the friendships of wicked men areoften formed by union in wickedness. They agree in little, except inenmity to God, and contempt of Christ.
Luk 23:13-25	<br>The fear of man brings many into this snare, that they will do anunjust thing, against their consciences, rather than get into trouble.Pilate declares Jesus innocent, and has a mind to release him; yet, toplease the people, he would punish him as an evil-doer. If no fault befound in him, why chastise him? Pilate yielded at length; he had notcourage to go against so strong a stream. He delivered Jesus to theirwill, to be crucified.
Luk 23:26-31	<br>We have here the blessed Jesus, the Lamb of God, led as a lamb to theslaughter, to the sacrifice. Though many reproached and reviled him,yet some pitied him. But the death of Christ was his victory andtriumph over his enemies: it was our deliverance, the purchase ofeternal life for us. Therefore weep not for him, but let us weep forour own sins, and the sins of our children, which caused his death; andweep for fear of the miseries we shall bring upon ourselves, if weslight his love, and reject his grace. If God delivered him up to suchsufferings as these, because he was made a sacrifice for sin, what willhe do with sinners themselves, who make themselves a dry tree, acorrupt and wicked generation, and good for nothing! The bittersufferings of our Lord Jesus should make us stand in awe of the justiceof God. The best saints, compared with Christ, are dry trees; if hesuffer, why may not they expect to suffer? And what then shall thedamnation of sinners be! Even the sufferings of Christ preach terror toobstinate transgressors.
Luk 23:32-43	<br>As soon as Christ was fastened to the cross, he prayed for those whocrucified him. The great thing he died to purchase and procure for us,is the forgiveness of sin. This he prays for. Jesus was crucifiedbetween two thieves; in them were shown the different effects the crossof Christ would have upon the children of men in the preaching thegospel. One malefactor was hardened to the last. No troubles ofthemselves will change a wicked heart. The other was softened at thelast: he was snatched as a brand out of the burning, and made amonument of Divine mercy. This gives no encouragement to any to put offrepentance to their death-beds, or to hope that they shall then findmercy. It is certain that true repentance is never too late; but it isas certain that late repentance is seldom true. None can be sure theyshall have time to repent at death, but every man may be sure he cannothave the advantages this penitent thief had. We shall see the case tobe singular, if we observe the uncommon effects of God's grace uponthis man. He reproved the other for railing on Christ. He owned that hedeserved what was done to him. He believed Jesus to have sufferedwrongfully. Observe his faith in this prayer. Christ was in the depthof disgrace, suffering as a deceiver, and not delivered by his Father.He made this profession before the wonders were displayed which puthonour on Christ's sufferings, and startled the centurion. He believedin a life to come, and desired to be happy in that life; not like theother thief, to be only saved from the cross. Observe his humility inthis prayer. All his request is, Lord, remember me; quite referring itto Jesus in what way to remember him. Thus he was humbled in truerepentance, and he brought forth all the fruits for repentance hiscircumstances would admit. Christ upon the cross, is gracious likeChrist upon the throne. Though he was in the greatest struggle andagony, yet he had pity for a poor penitent. By this act of grace we areto understand that Jesus Christ died to open the kingdom of heaven toall penitent, obedient believers. It is a single instance in Scripture;it should teach us to despair of none, and that none should despair ofthemselves; but lest it should be abused, it is contrasted with theawful state of the other thief, who died hardened in unbelief, though acrucified Saviour was so near him. Be sure that in general men die asthey live.
Luk 23:44-49	<br>We have here the death of Christ magnified by the wonders that attendedit, and his death explained by the words with which he breathed out hissoul. He was willing to offer himself. Let us seek to glorify God bytrue repentance and conversion; by protesting against those who crucifythe Saviour; by a sober, righteous, and godly life; and by employingour talents in the service of Him who died for us and rose again.
Luk 23:50-56	<br>Many, though they do not make any show in outward profession, yet, likeJoseph of Arimathea, will be far more ready to do real service, whenthere is occasion, than others who make a greater noise. Christ wasburied in haste, because the sabbath drew on. Weeping must not hindersowing. Though they were in tears for the death of their Lord, yet theymust prepare to keep holy the sabbath. When the sabbath draws on, theremust be preparation. Our worldly affairs must be so ordered, that theymay not hinder us from our sabbath work; and our holy affections sostirred up, that they may carry us on in it. In whatever business weengage, or however our hearts may be affected, let us never fail to getready for, and to keep holy, the day of sacred rest, which is theLord's day.
Luk 24:1-12	<br>See the affection and respect the women showed to Christ, after he wasdead and buried. Observe their surprise when they found the stonerolled away, and the grave empty. Christians often perplex themselvesabout that with which they should comfort and encourage themselves.They look rather to find their Master in his grave-clothes, than angelsin their shining garments. The angels assure them that he is risen fromthe dead; is risen by his own power. These angels from heaven bring notany new gospel, but remind the women of Christ's words, and teach themhow to apply them. We may wonder that these disciples, who believedJesus to be the Son of God and the true Messiah, who had been so oftentold that he must die, and rise again, and then enter into his glory,who had seen him more than once raise the dead, yet should be sobackward to believe his raising himself. But all our mistakes inreligion spring from ignorance or forgetfulness of the words Christ hasspoken. Peter now ran to the sepulchre, who so lately ran from hisMaster. He was amazed. There are many things puzzling and perplexing tous, which would be plain and profitable, if we rightly understood thewords of Christ.
Luk 24:13-27	<br>This appearance of Jesus to the two disciples going to Emmaus, happenedthe same day that he rose from the dead. It well becomes the disciplesof Christ to talk together of his death and resurrection; thus they mayimprove one another's knowledge, refresh one another's memory, and stirup each other's devout affections. And where but two together are wellemployed in work of that kind, he will come to them, and make a third.Those who seek Christ, shall find him: he will manifest himself tothose that inquire after him; and give knowledge to those who use thehelps for knowledge which they have. No matter how it was, but so itwas, they did not know him; he so ordering it, that they might the morefreely discourse with him. Christ's disciples are often sad andsorrowful, even when they have reason to rejoice; but through theweakness of their faith, they cannot take the comfort offered to them.Though Christ is entered into his state of exaltation, yet he noticesthe sorrows of his disciples, and is afflicted in their afflictions.Those are strangers in Jerusalem, that know not of the death andsufferings of Jesus. Those who have the knowledge of Christ crucified,should seek to spread that knowledge. Our Lord Jesus reproved them forthe weakness of their faith in the Scriptures of the Old Testament. Didwe know more of the Divine counsels as far as they are made known inthe Scriptures, we should not be subject to the perplexities we oftenentangle ourselves in. He shows them that the sufferings of Christ werereally the appointed way to his glory; but the cross of Christ was thatto which they could not reconcile themselves. Beginning at Moses, thefirst inspired writer of the Old Testament, Jesus expounded to them thethings concerning himself. There are many passages throughout all theScriptures concerning Christ, which it is of great advantage to puttogether. We cannot go far in any part, but we meet with something thathas reference to Christ, some prophecy, some promise, some prayer, sometype or other. A golden thread of gospel grace runs through the wholeweb of the Old Testament. Christ is the best expositor of Scripture;and even after his resurrection, he led people to know the mysteryconcerning himself, not by advancing new notions, but by showing howthe Scripture was fulfilled, and turning them to the earnest study ofit.
Luk 24:28-35	<br>If we would have Christ dwell with us, we must be earnest with him.Those that have experienced the pleasure and profit of communion withhim, cannot but desire more of his company. He took bread, and blessedit, and brake, and gave to them. This he did with his usual authorityand affection, with the same manner, perhaps with the same words. Hehere teaches us to crave a blessing on every meal. See how Christ byhis Spirit and grace makes himself known to the souls of his people. Heopens the Scriptures to them. He meets them at his table, in theordinance of the Lord's supper; is known to them in breaking of bread.But the work is completed by the opening of the eyes of their mind; yetit is but short views we have of Christ in this world, but when weenter heaven, we shall see him for ever. They had found the preachingpowerful, even when they knew not the preacher. Those Scriptures whichspeak of Christ, will warm the hearts of his true disciples. That islikely to do most good, which affects us with the love of Jesus indying for us. It is the duty of those to whom he has shown himself, tolet others know what he has done for their souls. It is of great usefor the disciples of Christ to compare their experiences, and tell themto each other.
Luk 24:36-49	<br>Jesus appeared in a miraculous manner, assuring the disciples of hispeace, though they had so lately forsaken him, and promising spiritualpeace with every blessing. Many troublesome thoughts which disquiet ourminds, rise from mistakes concerning Christ. All the troublesomethoughts which rise in our hearts at any time, are known to the LordJesus, and are displeasing to him. He spake with them on theirunreasonable unbelief. Nothing had passed but what was foretold by theprophets, and necessary for the salvation of sinners. And now all menshould be taught the nature and necessity of repentance, in order tothe forgiveness of their sins. And these blessings were to be soughtfor, by faith in the name of Jesus. Christ by his Spirit works on theminds of men. Even good men need to have their understandings opened.But that we may have right thoughts of Christ, there needs no more thanto be made to understand the Scriptures.
Luk 24:50-53	<br>Christ ascended from Bethany, near the Mount of Olives. There was thegarden in which his sufferings began; there he was in his agony. Thosethat would go to heaven, must ascend thither from the house ofsufferings and sorrows. The disciples did not see him rise out of thegrave; his resurrection could be proved by their seeing him aliveafterwards: but they saw him ascend into heaven; they could nototherwise have a proof of his ascension. He lifted up his hands, andblessed them. He did not go away in displeasure, but in love, he left ablessing behind him. As he arose, so he ascended, by his own power.They worshipped him. This fresh display of Christ's glory drew fromthem fresh acknowledgments. They returned to Jerusalem with great joy.The glory of Christ is the joy of all true believers, even while theyare here in this world. While waiting for God's promises, we must goforth to meet them with our praises. And nothing better prepares themind for receiving the Holy Ghost. Fears are silenced, sorrowssweetened and allayed, and hopes kept up. And this is the ground of aChristian's boldness at the throne of grace; yea, the Father's throneis the throne of grace to us, because it is also the throne of ourMediator, Jesus Christ. Let us rely on his promises, and plead them.Let us attend his ordinances, praise and bless God for his mercies, setour affections on things above, and expect the Redeemer's return tocomplete our happiness. Amen. Even so, Lord Jesus, come quickly.
Joh 1:1-5	<br>The plainest reason why the Son of God is called the Word, seems to be,that as our words explain our minds to others, so was the Son of Godsent in order to reveal his Father's mind to the world. What theevangelist says of Christ proves that he is God. He asserts, Hisexistence in the beginning; His coexistence with the Father. The Wordwas with God. All things were made by him, and not as an instrument.Without him was not any thing made that was made, from the highestangel to the meanest worm. This shows how well qualified he was for thework of our redemption and salvation. The light of reason, as well asthe life of sense, is derived from him, and depends upon him. Thiseternal Word, this true Light shines, but the darkness comprehends itnot. Let us pray without ceasing, that our eyes may be opened to beholdthis Light, that we may walk in it; and thus be made wise untosalvation, by faith in Jesus Christ.
Joh 1:6-14	<br>John the Baptist came to bear witness concerning Jesus. Nothing morefully shows the darkness of men's minds, than that when the Light hadappeared, there needed a witness to call attention to it. Christ wasthe true Light; that great Light which deserves to be called so. By hisSpirit and grace he enlightens all that are enlightened to salvation;and those that are not enlightened by him, perish in darkness. Christwas in the world when he took our nature upon him, and dwelt among us.The Son of the Highest was here in this lower world. He was in theworld, but not of it. He came to save a lost world, because it was aworld of his own making. Yet the world knew him not. When he comes as aJudge, the world shall know him. Many say that they are Christ's own,yet do not receive him, because they will not part with their sins, norhave him to reign over them. All the children of God are born again.This new birth is through the word of God as the means, 1Pe 1:23, andby the Spirit of God as the Author. By his Divine presence Christalways was in the world. But now that the fulness of time was come, hewas, after another manner, God manifested in the flesh. But observe thebeams of his Divine glory, which darted through this veil of flesh. Mendiscover their weaknesses to those most familiar with them, but it wasnot so with Christ; those most intimate with him saw most of his glory.Although he was in the form of a servant, as to outward circumstances,yet, in respect of graces, his form was like the Son of God His Divineglory appeared in the holiness of his doctrine, and in his miracles. Hewas full of grace, fully acceptable to his Father, therefore qualifiedto plead for us; and full of truth, fully aware of the things he was toreveal.
Joh 1:15-18	<br>As to the order of time and entrance on his work, Christ came afterJohn, but in every other way he was before him. The expression clearlyshows that Jesus had existence before he appeared on earth as man. Allfulness dwells in him, from which alone fallen sinners have, and shallreceive, by faith, all that renders them wise, strong, holy, useful,and happy. Our receivings by Christ are all summed up in this one word,grace; we have received "even grace," a gift so great, so rich, soinvaluable; the good will of God towards us, and the good work of Godin us. The law of God is holy, just, and good; and we should make theproper use of it. But we cannot derive from it pardon, righteousness,or strength. It teaches us to adorn the doctrine of God our Saviour,but it cannot supply the place of that doctrine. As no mercy comes fromGod to sinners but through Jesus Christ, no man can come to the Fatherbut by him; no man can know God, except as he is made known in the onlybegotten and beloved Son.
Joh 1:19-28	<br>John disowns himself to be the Christ, who was now expected and waitedfor. He came in the spirit and power of Elias, but he was not theperson of Elias. John was not that Prophet whom Moses said the Lordwould raise up to them of their brethren, like unto him. He was notsuch a prophet as they expected, who would rescue them from the Romans.He gave such an account of himself, as might excite and awaken them tohearken to him. He baptized the people with water as a profession ofrepentance, and as an outward sign of the spiritual blessings to beconferred on them by the Messiah, who was in the midst of them, thoughthey knew him not, and to whom he was unworthy to render the meanestservice.
Joh 1:29-36	<br>John saw Jesus coming to him, and pointed him out as the Lamb of God.The paschal lamb, in the shedding and sprinkling of its blood, theroasting and eating of its flesh, and all the other circumstances ofthe ordinance, represented the salvation of sinners by faith in Christ.And the lambs sacrificed every morning and evening, can only refer toChrist slain as a sacrifice to redeem us to God by his blood. John cameas a preacher of repentance, yet he told his followers that they wereto look for the pardon of their sins to Jesus only, and to his death.It agrees with God's glory to pardon all who depend on the atoningsacrifice of Christ. He takes away the sin of the world; purchasespardon for all that repent and believe the gospel. This encourages ourfaith; if Christ takes away the sin of the world, then why not my sin?He bore sin for us, and so bears it from us. God could have taken awaysin, by taking away the sinner, as he took away the sin of the oldworld; but here is a way of doing away sin, yet sparing the sinner, bymaking his Son sin, that is, a sin-offering, for us. See Jesus takingaway sin, and let that cause hatred of sin, and resolutions against it.Let us not hold that fast, which the Lamb of God came to take away. Toconfirm his testimony concerning Christ, John declares the appearanceat his baptism, in which God himself bore witness to him. He saw andbare record that he is the Son of God. This is the end and object ofJohn's testimony, that Jesus was the promised Messiah. John took everyopportunity that offered to lead people to Christ.
Joh 1:37-42	<br>The strongest and most prevailing argument with an awakened soul tofollow Christ, is, that it is he only who takes away sin. Whatevercommunion there is between our souls and Christ, it is he who beginsthe discourse. He asked, What seek ye? The question Jesus put to them,we should all put to ourselves when we begin to follow Him, What do wedesign and desire? In following Christ, do we seek the favour of Godand eternal life? He invites them to come without delay. Now is theaccepted time, 2Co 6:2. It is good for us to be where Christ is,wherever it be. We ought to labour for the spiritual welfare of thoserelated to us, and seek to bring them to Him. Those who come to Christ,must come with a fixed resolution to be firm and constant to him, likea stone, solid and stedfast; and it is by his grace that they are so.
Joh 1:43-51	<br>See the nature of true Christianity, it is following Jesus; devotingourselves to him, and treading in his steps. Observe the objectionNathanael made. All who desire to profit by the word of God, mustbeware of prejudices against places, or denominations of men. Theyshould examine for themselves, and they will sometimes find good wherethey looked for none. Many people are kept from the ways of religion bythe unreasonable prejudices they conceive. The best way to remove falsenotions of religion, is to make trial of it. In Nathanael there was noguile. His profession was not hypocritical. He was not a dissembler,nor dishonest; he was a sound character, a really upright, godly man.Christ knows what men are indeed. Does He know us? Let us desire toknow him. Let us seek and pray to be Israelites indeed, in whom is noguile; truly Christians, approved of Christ himself. Some things weak,imperfect, and sinful, are found in all, but hypocrisy belongs not to abeliever's character. Jesus witnessed what passed when Nathanael wasunder the fig-tree. Probably he was then in fervent prayer, seekingdirection as to the Hope and Consolation of Israel, where no human eyeobserved him. This showed him that our Lord knew the secrets of hisheart. Through Christ we commune with, and benefit by the holy angels;and things in heaven and things on earth are reconciled and unitedtogether.
Joh 2:1-11	<br>It is very desirable when there is a marriage, to have Christ own andbless it. Those that would have Christ with them at their marriage,must invite him by prayer, and he will come. While in this world wesometimes find ourselves in straits, even when we think ourselves infulness. There was want at a marriage feast. Those who are come to carefor the things of the world, must look for trouble, and count upondisappointment. In our addresses to Christ, we must humbly spread ourcase before him, and then refer ourselves to him to do as he pleases.In Christ's reply to his mother there was no disrespect. He used thesame word when speaking to her with affection from the cross; yet it isa standing testimony against the idolatry of after-ages, in givingundue honours to his mother. His hour is come when we know not what todo. Delays of mercy are not denials of prayer. Those that expectChrist's favours, must observe his orders with ready obedience. The wayof duty is the way to mercy; and Christ's methods must not be objectedagainst. The beginning of Moses' miracles was turning water into blood,Ex 7:20; the beginning of Christ's miracles was turning water intowine; which may remind us of the difference between the law of Mosesand the gospel of Christ. He showed that he improves creature-comfortsto all true believers, and make them comforts indeed. And Christ'sworks are all for use. Has he turned thy water into wine, given theeknowledge and grace? it is to profit withal; therefore draw out now,and use it. It was the best wine. Christ's works commend themselveseven to those who know not their Author. What was produced by miracles,always was the best in its kind. Though Christ hereby allows a rightuse of wine, he does not in the least do away his own caution, whichis, that our hearts be not at any time overcharged with surfeiting anddrunkenness, Lu 21:34. Though we need not scruple to feast with ourfriends on proper occasions, yet every social interview should be soconducted, that we might invite the Redeemer to join with us, if hewere now on earth; and all levity, luxury, and excess offend him.
Joh 2:12-22	<br>The first public work in which we find Christ engaged, was driving fromthe temple the traders whom the covetous priests and rulers encouragedto make a market-place of its courts. Those now make God's house ahouse of merchandise, whose minds are filled with cares about worldlybusiness when attending religious exercises, or who perform Divineoffices for love of gain. Christ, having thus cleansed the temple, gavea sign to those who demanded it, to prove his authority for so doing.He foretells his death by the Jews' malice, Destroy ye this temple; Iwill permit you to destroy it. He foretells his resurrection by his ownpower; In three days I will raise it up. Christ took again his ownlife. Men mistake by understanding that according to the letter, whichthe Scripture speaks by way of figure. When Jesus was risen from thedead, his disciples remembered he has said this. It helps much inunderstanding the Divine word, to observe the fulfilling of theScriptures.
Joh 2:23-25	<br>Our Lord knew all men, their nature, dispositions, affections, designs,so as we do not know any man, not even ourselves. He knows his craftyenemies, and all their secret projects; his false friends, and theirtrue characters. He knows who are truly his, knows their uprightness,and knows their weaknesses. We know what is done by men; Christ knowswhat is in them, he tries the heart. Beware of a dead faith, or aformal profession: carnal, empty professors are not to be trusted, andhowever men impose on others or themselves, they cannot impose on theheart-searching God.
Joh 3:1-8	<br>Nicodemus was afraid, or ashamed to be seen with Christ, therefore camein the night. When religion is out of fashion, there are manyNicodemites. But though he came by night, Jesus bid him welcome, andhereby taught us to encourage good beginnings, although weak. Andthough now he came by night, yet afterward he owned Christ publicly. Hedid not talk with Christ about state affairs, though he was a ruler,but about the concerns of his own soul and its salvation, and went atonce to them. Our Saviour spoke of the necessity and nature ofregeneration or the new birth, and at once directed Nicodemus to thesource of holiness of the heart. Birth is the beginning of life; to beborn again, is to begin to live anew, as those who have lived muchamiss, or to little purpose. We must have a new nature, new principles,new affections, new aims. By our first birth we were corrupt, shapen insin; therefore we must be made new creatures. No stronger expressioncould have been chosen to signify a great and most remarkable change ofstate and character. We must be entirely different from what we werebefore, as that which begins to be at any time, is not, and cannot bethe same with that which was before. This new birth is from heaven, ch.1:13, and its tendency is to heaven. It is a great change made in theheart of a sinner, by the power of the Holy Spirit. It means thatsomething is done in us, and for us, which we cannot do for ourselves.Something is wrong, whereby such a life begins as shall last for ever.We cannot otherwise expect any benefit by Christ; it is necessary toour happiness here and hereafter. What Christ speak, Nicodemusmisunderstood, as if there had been no other way of regenerating andnew-moulding an immortal soul, than by new-framing the body. But heacknowledged his ignorance, which shows a desire to be better informed.It is then further explained by the Lord Jesus. He shows the Author ofthis blessed change. It is not wrought by any wisdom or power of ourown, but by the power of the blessed Spirit. We are shapen in iniquity,which makes it necessary that our nature be changed. We are not tomarvel at this; for, when we consider the holiness of God, thedepravity of our nature, and the happiness set before us, we shall notthink it strange that so much stress is laid upon this. Theregenerating work of the Holy Spirit is compared to water. It is alsoprobable that Christ had reference to the ordinance of baptism. Notthat all those, and those only, that are baptized, are saved; butwithout that new birth which is wrought by the Spirit, and signified bybaptism, none shall be subjects of the kingdom of heaven. The same wordsignifies both the wind and the Spirit. The wind bloweth where itlisteth for us; God directs it. The Spirit sends his influences where,and when, on whom, and in what measure and degree, he pleases. Thoughthe causes are hidden, the effects are plain, when the soul is broughtto mourn for sin, and to breathe after Christ. Christ's stating of thedoctrine and the necessity of regeneration, it should seem, made it notclearer to Nicodemus. Thus the things of the Spirit of God arefoolishness to the natural man. Many think that cannot be proved, whichthey cannot believe. Christ's discourse of gospel truths, 
Joh 3:11-13), shows the folly of those who make these things strange untothem; and it recommends us to search them out. Jesus Christ is everyway able to reveal the will of God to us; for he came down from heaven,and yet is in heaven. We have here a notice of Christ's two distinctnatures in one person, so that while he is the Son of man, yet he is inheaven. God is the "HE THAT IS," and heaven is the dwelling-place ofhis holiness. The knowledge of this must be from above, and can bereceived by faith alone. Jesus Christ came to save us by healing us, asthe children of Israel, stung with fiery serpents, were cured and livedby looking up to the brazen serpent, Nu 21:6-9. In this observe thedeadly and destructive nature of sin. Ask awakened consciences, askdamned sinners, they will tell you, that how charming soever theallurements of sin may be, at the last it bites like a serpent. See thepowerful remedy against this fatal malady. Christ is plainly set forthto us in the gospel. He whom we offended is our Peace, and the way ofapplying for a cure is by believing. If any so far slight either theirdisease by sin, or the method of cure by Christ, as not to receiveChrist upon his own terms, their ruin is upon their own heads. He hassaid, Look and be saved, look and live; lift up the eyes of your faithto Christ crucified. And until we have grace to do this, we shall notbe cured, but still are wounded with the stings of Satan, and in adying state. Jesus Christ came to save us by pardoning us, that wemight not die by the sentence of the law. Here is gospel, good newsindeed. Here is God's love in giving his Son for the world. God soloved the world; so really, so richly. Behold and wonder, that thegreat God should love such a worthless world! Here, also, is the greatgospel duty, to believe in Jesus Christ. God having given him to be ourProphet, Priest, and King, we must give up ourselves to be ruled, andtaught, and saved by him. And here is the great gospel benefit, thatwhoever believes in Christ, shall not perish, but shall haveeverlasting life. God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself,and so saving it. It could not be saved, but through him; there is nosalvation in any other. From all this is shown the happiness of truebelievers; he that believeth in Christ is not condemned. Though he hasbeen a great sinner, yet he is not dealt with according to what hissins deserve. How great is the sin of unbelievers! God sent One to saveus, that was dearest to himself; and shall he not be dearest to us? Howgreat is the misery of unbelievers! they are condemned already; whichspeaks a certain condemnation; a present condemnation. The wrath of Godnow fastens upon them; and their own hearts condemn them. There is alsoa condemnation grounded on their former guilt; they are open to the lawfor all their sins; because they are not by faith interested in thegospel pardon. Unbelief is a sin against the remedy. It springs fromthe enmity of the heart of man to God, from love of sin in some form.Read also the doom of those that would not know Christ. Sinful worksare works of darkness. The wicked world keep as far from this light asthey can, lest their deeds should be reproved. Christ is hated, becausesin is loved. If they had not hated saving knowledge, they would notsit down contentedly in condemning ignorance. On the other hand,renewed hearts bid this light welcome. A good man acts truly andsincerely in all he does. He desires to know what the will of God is,and to do it, though against his own worldly interest. A change in hiswhole character and conduct has taken place. The love of God is shedabroad in his heart by the Holy Ghost, and is become the commandingprinciple of his actions. So long as he continues under a load ofunforgiven guilt, there can be little else than slavish fear of God;but when his doubts are done away, when he sees the righteous groundwhereon this forgiveness is built, he rests on it as his own, and isunited to God by unfeigned love. Our works are good when the will ofGod is the rule of them, and the glory of God the end of them; whenthey are done in his strength, and for his sake; to him, and not tomen. Regeneration, or the new birth, is a subject to which the world isvery averse; it is, however, the grand concern, in comparison withwhich every thing else is but trifling. What does it signify though wehave food to eat in plenty, and variety of raiment to put on, if we arenot born again? if after a few mornings and evenings spent inunthinking mirth, carnal pleasure, and riot, we die in our sins, andlie down in sorrow? What does it signify though we are well able to actour parts in life, in every other respect, if at last we hear from theSupreme Judge, "Depart from me, I know you not, ye workers ofiniquity?"	
Joh 3:22-36	<br>John was fully satisfied with the place and work assigned him; butJesus came on a more important work. He also knew that Jesus wouldincrease in honour and influence, for of his government and peace therewould be no end, while he himself would be less followed. John knewthat Jesus came from heaven as the Son of God, while he was a sinful,mortal man, who could only speak about the more plain subjects ofreligion. The words of Jesus were the words of God; he had the Spirit,not by measure, as the prophets, but in all fulness. Everlasting lifecould only be had by faith in Him, and might be thus obtained; whereasall those, who believe not in the Son of God, cannot partake ofsalvation, but the wrath of God for ever rests upon them.
Joh 4:1-3	<br>Jesus applied himself more to preaching, which was the more excellent,1Co 1:17, than to baptism. He would put honour upon his disciples, byemploying them to baptize. He teaches us that the benefit of sacramentsdepends not on the hand that administers them.
Joh 4:4-26	<br>There was great hatred between the Samaritans and the Jews. Christ'sroad from Judea to Galilee lay through Samaria. We should not go intoplaces of temptation but when we needs must; and then must not dwell inthem, but hasten through them. We have here our Lord Jesus under thecommon fatigue of travellers. Thus we see that he was truly a man. Toilcame in with sin; therefore Christ, having made himself a curse for us,submitted to it. Also, he was a poor man, and went all his journeys onfoot. Being wearied, he sat thus on the well; he had no couch to restupon. He sat thus, as people wearied with travelling sit. Surely, weought readily to submit to be like the Son of God in such things asthese. Christ asked a woman for water. She was surprised because he didnot show the anger of his own nation against the Samaritans. Moderatemen of all sides are men wondered at. Christ took the occasion to teachher Divine things: he converted this woman, by showing her ignoranceand sinfulness, and her need of a Saviour. By this living water ismeant the Spirit. Under this comparison the blessing of the Messiah hadbeen promised in the Old Testament. The graces of the Spirit, and hiscomforts, satisfy the thirsting soul, that knows its own nature andnecessity. What Jesus spake figuratively, she took literally. Christshows that the water of Jacob's well yielded a very short satisfaction.Of whatever waters of comfort we drink, we shall thirst again. Butwhoever partakes of the Spirit of grace, and the comforts of thegospel, shall never want that which will abundantly satisfy his soul.Carnal hearts look no higher than carnal ends. Give it me, saith she,not that I may have everlasting life, which Christ proposed, but that Icome not hither to draw. The carnal mind is very ingenious in shiftingoff convictions, and keeping them from fastening. But how closely ourLord Jesus brings home the conviction to her conscience! He severelyreproved her present state of life. The woman acknowledged Christ to bea prophet. The power of his word in searching the heart, and convincingthe conscience of secret things, is a proof of Divine authority. Itshould cool our contests, to think that the things we are strivingabout are passing away. The object of worship will continue still thesame, God, as a Father; but an end shall be put to all differencesabout the place of worship. Reason teaches us to consult decency andconvenience in the places of our worship; but religion gives nopreference to one place above another, in respect of holiness andapproval with God. The Jews were certainly in the right. Those who bythe Scriptures have obtained some knowledge of God, know whom theyworship. The word of salvation was of the Jews. It came to othernations through them. Christ justly preferred the Jewish worship beforethe Samaritan, yet here he speaks of the former as soon to be doneaway. God was about to be revealed as the Father of all believers inevery nation. The spirit or the soul of man, as influenced by the HolySpirit, must worship God, and have communion with him. Spiritualaffections, as shown in fervent prayers, supplications, andthanksgivings, form the worship of an upright heart, in which Goddelights and is glorified. The woman was disposed to leave the matterundecided, till the coming of the Messiah. But Christ told her, I thatspeak to thee, am He. She was an alien and a hostile Samaritan, merelyspeaking to her was thought to disgrace our Lord Jesus. Yet to thiswoman did our Lord reveal himself more fully than as yet he had done toany of his disciples. No past sins can bar our acceptance with him, ifwe humble ourselves before him, believing in him as the Christ, theSaviour of the world.
Joh 4:27-42	<br>The disciples wondered that Christ talked thus with a Samaritan. Yetthey knew it was for some good reason, and for some good end. Thus whenparticular difficulties occur in the word and providence of God, it isgood to satisfy ourselves that all is well that Jesus Christ says anddoes. Two things affected the woman. The extent of his knowledge.Christ knows all the thoughts, words, and actions, of all the childrenof men. And the power of his word. He told her secret sins with power.She fastened upon that part of Christ's discourse, many would think shewould have been most shy of repeating; but the knowledge of Christ,into which we are led by conviction of sin, is most likely to be soundand saving. They came to him: those who would know Christ, must meethim where he records his name. Our Master has left us an example, thatwe may learn to do the will of God as he did; with diligence, as thosethat make a business of it; with delight and pleasure in it. Christcompares his work to harvest-work. The harvest is appointed and lookedfor before it comes; so was the gospel. Harvest-time is busy time; allmust be then at work. Harvest-time is a short time, and harvest-workmust be done then, or not at all; so the time of the gospel is aseason, which if once past, cannot be recalled. God sometimes uses veryweak and unlikely instruments for beginning and carrying on a goodwork. Our Saviour, by teaching one poor woman, spread knowledge to awhole town. Blessed are those who are not offended at Christ. Thosetaught of God, are truly desirous to learn more. It adds much to thepraise of our love to Christ and his word, if it conquers prejudices.Their faith grew. In the matter of it: they believed him to be theSaviour, not only of the Jews but of the world. In the certainty of it:we know that this is indeed the Christ. And in the ground of it, for wehave heard him ourselves.
Joh 4:43-54	<br>The father was a nobleman, yet the son was sick. Honours and titles areno security from sickness and death. The greatest men must gothemselves to God, must become beggars. The nobleman did not stop fromhis request till he prevailed. But at first he discovered the weaknessof his faith in the power of Christ. It is hard to persuade ourselvesthat distance of time and place, are no hinderance to the knowledge,mercy, and power of our Lord Jesus. Christ gave an answer of peace.Christ's saying that the soul lives, makes it alive. The father wenthis way, which showed the sincerity of his faith. Being satisfied, hedid not hurry home that night, but returned as one easy in his ownmind. His servants met him with the news of the child's recovery. Goodnews will meet those that hope in God's word. Diligent comparing theworks of Jesus with his word, will confirm our faith. And the bringingthe cure to the family brought salvation to it. Thus an experience ofthe power of one word of Christ, may settle the authority of Christ inthe soul. The whole family believed likewise. The miracle made Jesusdear to them. The knowledge of Christ still spreads through families,and men find health and salvation to their souls.
Joh 5:1-9	<br>We are all by nature impotent folk in spiritual things, blind, halt,and withered; but full provision is made for our cure, if we attend toit. An angel went down, and troubled the water; and what disease soeverit was, this water cured it, but only he that first stepped in hadbenefit. This teaches us to be careful, that we let not a season slipwhich may never return. The man had lost the use of his limbsthirty-eight years. Shall we, who perhaps for many years have scarcelyknown what it has been to be a day sick, complain of one wearisomenight, when many others, better than we, have scarcely known what ithas been to be a day well? Christ singled this one out from the rest.Those long in affliction, may comfort themselves that God keeps accounthow long. Observe, this man speaks of the unkindness of those abouthim, without any peevish reflections. As we should be thankful, so weshould be patient. Our Lord Jesus cures him, though he neither askednor thought of it. Arise, and walk. God's command, Turn and live; Makeye a new heart; no more supposes power in us without the grace of God,his distinguishing grace, than this command supposed such power in theimpotent man: it was by the power of Christ, and he must have all theglory. What a joyful surprise to the poor cripple, to find himself of asudden so easy, so strong, so able to help himself! The proof ofspiritual cure, is our rising and walking. Has Christ healed ourspiritual diseases, let us go wherever he sends us, and take upwhatever he lays upon us; and walk before him.
Joh 5:10-16	<br>Those eased of the punishment of sin, are in danger of returning tosin, when the terror and restraint are over, unless Divine grace driesup the fountain. The misery believers are made whole from, warns us tosin no more, having felt the smart of sin. This is the voice of everyprovidence, Go, and sin no more. Christ saw it necessary to give thiscaution; for it is common for people, when sick, to promise much; whennewly recovered, to perform only something; but after awhile to forgetall. Christ spoke of the wrath to come, which is beyond compare worsethan the many hours, nay, weeks and years of pain, some wicked men haveto suffer in consequence of their unlawful indulgences. And if suchafflictions are severe, how dreadful will be the everlasting punishmentof the wicked!
Joh 5:17-23	<br>The Divine power of the miracle proved Jesus to be the Son of God, andhe declared that he worked with, and like unto his Father, as he sawgood. These ancient enemies of Christ understood him, and became moreviolent, charging him not only with sabbath-breaking, but blasphemy, incalling God his own Father, and making himself equal with God. But allthings now, and at the final judgment, are committed to the Son,purposely that all men might honour the Son, as they honour the Father;and every one who does not thus honour the Son, whatever he may thinkor pretend, does not honour the Father who sent him.
Joh 5:24-29	<br>Our Lord declared his authority and character, as the Messiah. The timewas come when the dead should hear his voice, as the Son of God, andlive. Our Lord first refers to his raising those who were dead in sin,to newness of life, by the power of the Spirit, and then to his raisingthe dead in their graves. The office of Judge of all men, can only beexercised by one who has all knowledge, and almighty power. May webelieve His testimony; thus our faith and hope will be in God, and weshall not come into condemnation. And may His voice reach the hearts ofthose dead in sin; that they may do works meet for repentance, andprepare for the solemn day.
Joh 5:30-38	<br>Our Lord returns to his declaration of the entire agreement between theFather and the Son, and declared himself the Son of God. He had highertestimony than that of John; his works bore witness to all he had said.But the Divine word had no abiding-place in their hearts, as theyrefused to believe in Him whom the Father had sent, according to hisancient promises. The voice of God, accompanied by the power of theHoly Ghost, thus made effectual to the conversion of sinners, stillproclaims that this is the beloved Son, in whom the Father is wellpleased. But when the hearts of men are full of pride, ambition, andthe love of the world, there is no room for the word of God to abide inthem.
Joh 5:39-44	<br>The Jews considered that eternal life was revealed to them in theirScriptures, and that they had it, because they had the word of God intheir hands. Jesus urged them to search those Scriptures with morediligence and attention. "Ye do search the Scriptures," and ye do wellto do so. They did indeed search the Scriptures, but it was with a viewto their own glory. It is possible for men to be very studious in theletter of the Scriptures, yet to be strangers to its power. Or, "Searchthe Scriptures," and so it was spoken to them in the nature of anappeal. Ye profess to receive and believe the Scripture, let that bethe judge. It is spoken to us as advising or commanding all Christiansto search the Scriptures. Not only read them, and hear them, but searchthem; which denotes diligence in examining and studying them. We mustsearch the Scriptures for heaven as our great end; For in them ye thinkye have eternal life. We must search the Scriptures for Christ, as thenew and living Way, that leads to this end. To this testimony Christadds reproofs of their unbelief and wickedness; their neglect of himand his doctrine. Also he reproves their want of the love of God. Butthere is life with Jesus Christ for poor souls. Many who make a greatprofession of religion, yet show they want the love of God, by theirneglect of Christ and contempt of his commandments. It is the love ofGod in us, the love that is a living, active principle in the heart,which God will accept. They slighted and undervalued Christ, becausethey admired and overvalued themselves. How can those believe, who makethe praise and applause of men their idol! When Christ and hisfollowers are men wondered at, how can those believe, the utmost ofwhose ambition is to make a fair show in the flesh!
Joh 5:45-47	<br>Many trust in some form of doctrines or some parties, who no more enterinto the real meaning of those doctrines, or the views of the personswhose names they bear, than the Jews did into those of Moses. Let ussearch and pray over the Scriptures, as intent on finding eternal life;let us observe how Christ is the great subject of them, and daily applyto him for the life he bestows.
Joh 6:1-14	<br>John relates the miracle of feeding the multitude, for its reference tothe following discourse. Observe the effect this miracle had upon thepeople. Even the common Jews expected the Messiah to come into theworld, and to be a great Prophet. The Pharisees despised them as notknowing the law; but they knew most of Him who is the end of the law.Yet men may acknowledge Christ as that Prophet, and still turn a deafear to him.
Joh 6:15-21	<br>Here were Christ's disciples in the way of duty, and Christ was prayingfor them; yet they were in distress. There may be perils andafflictions of this present time, where there is an interest in Christ.Clouds and darkness often surround the children of the light and of theday. They see Jesus walking on the sea. Even the approaches of comfortand deliverance often are so mistaken, as to become the occasions offear. Nothing is more powerful to convince sinners than that word, "Iam Jesus whom thou persecutest;" nothing more powerful to comfortsaints than this, "I am Jesus whom thou lovest." If we have receivedChrist Jesus the Lord, though the night be dark, and the wind high, yetwe may comfort ourselves, we shall be at the shore before long.
Joh 6:22-27	<br>Instead of answering the inquiry how he came there, Jesus blamed theirasking. The utmost earnestness should be employed in seeking salvation,in the use of appointed means; yet it is to be sought only as the giftof the Son of man. Him the Father has sealed, proved to be God. Hedeclared the Son of man to be the Son of God with power.
Joh 6:28-35	<br>Constant exercise of faith in Christ, is the most important anddifficult part of the obedience required from us, as sinners seekingsalvation. When by his grace we are enabled to live a life of faith inthe Son of God, holy tempers follow, and acceptable services may bedone. God, even his Father, who gave their fathers that food fromheaven to support their natural lives, now gave them the true Bread forthe salvation of their souls. Coming to Jesus, and believing on him,signify the same. Christ shows that he is the true Bread; he is to thesoul what bread is to the body, nourishes and supports the spirituallife. He is the Bread of God. Bread which the Father gives, which hehas made to be the food of our souls. Bread nourishes only by thepowers of a living body; but Christ is himself living Bread, andnourishes by his own power. The doctrine of Christ crucified is now asstrengthening and comforting to a believer as ever it was. He is theBread which came down from heaven. It denotes the Divinity of Christ'sperson and his authority; also, the Divine origin of all the good whichflows to us through him. May we with understanding and earnestness say,Lord, evermore give us this Bread.
Joh 6:36-46	<br>The discovery of their guilt, danger, and remedy, by the teaching ofthe Holy Spirit, makes men willing and glad to come, and to give upevery thing which hinders applying to him for salvation. The Father'swill is, that not one of those who were given to the Son, should berejected or lost by him. No one will come, till Divine grace hassubdued, and in part changed his heart; therefore no one who comes willever be cast out. The gospel finds none willing to be saved in thehumbling, holy manner, made known therein; but God draws with his wordand the Holy Ghost; and man's duty is to hear and learn; that is tosay, to receive the grace offered, and consent to the promise. None hadseen the Father but his beloved Son; and the Jews must expect to betaught by his inward power upon their minds, and by his word, and theministers whom he sent among them.
Joh 6:47-51	<br>The advantage of the manna was small, it only referred to this life;but the living Bread is so excellent, that the man who feedeth on itshall never die. This bread is Christ's human nature, which he took topresent to the Father, as a sacrifice for the sins of the world; topurchase all things pertaining to life and godliness, for sinners ofevery nation, who repent and believe in him.
Joh 6:52-59	<br>The flesh and blood of the Son of man, denote the Redeemer in thenature of man; Christ and him crucified, and the redemption wrought outby him, with all the precious benefits of redemption; pardon of sin,acceptance with God, the way to the throne of grace, the promises ofthe covenant, and eternal life. These are called the flesh and blood ofChrist, because they are purchased by the breaking his body, and theshedding of his blood. Also, because they are meat and drink to oursouls. Eating this flesh and drinking this blood mean believing inChrist. We partake of Christ and his benefits by faith. The soul thatrightly knows its state and wants, finds whatever can calm theconscience, and promote true holiness, in the redeemer, God manifest inthe flesh. Meditating upon the cross of Christ gives life to ourrepentance, love, and gratitude. We live by him, as our bodies live byour food. We live by him, as the members by the head, the branches bythe root: because he lives we shall live also.
Joh 6:60-65	<br>The human nature of Christ had not before been in heaven, but being Godand man, that wondrous Person was truly said to have come down fromheaven. The Messiah's kingdom was not of this world; and they were tounderstand by faith, what he had said of a spiritual living upon him,and his fulness. As without the soul of man the flesh is of no value,so without the quickening Spirit of God all forms of religion are deadand worthless. He who made this provision for our souls, alone canteach us these things, and draw us unto Christ, that we may live byfaith in him. Let us apply to Christ, thankful that it is declared thatevery one who is willing to come unto him shall be made welcome.
Joh 6:66-71	<br>When we admit into our minds hard thoughts of the words and works ofJesus, we enter into temptation, which, if the Lord in mercy preventnot, will end in drawing back. The corrupt and wicked heart of manoften makes that an occasion for offence, which is matter of thegreatest comfort. Our Lord had, in the foregoing discourse, promisedeternal life to his followers; the disciples fastened on that plainsaying, and resolved to cleave to him, when others fastened on hardsayings, and forsook him. Christ's doctrine is the word of eternallife, therefore we must live and die by it. If we forsake Christ, weforsake our own mercies. They believed that this Jesus was the Messiahpromised to their fathers, the Son of the living God. When we aretempted to backslide or turn away, it is good to remember firstprinciples, and to keep to them. And let us ever remember our Lord'ssearching question; Shall we go away and forsake our Redeemer? To whomcan we go? He alone can give salvation by the forgiveness of sins. Andthis alone brings confidence, comfort, and joy, and bids fear anddespondency flee away. It gains the only solid happiness in this world,and opens a way to the happiness of the next.
Joh 7:1-13	<br>The brethren or kinsmen of Jesus were disgusted, when they found therewas no prospect of worldly advantages from him. Ungodly men sometimesundertake to counsel those employed in the work of God; but they onlyadvise what appears likely to promote present advantages. The peoplediffered about his doctrine and miracles, while those who favoured him,dared not openly to avow their sentiments. Those who count thepreachers of the gospel to be deceivers, speak out, while many whofavour them, fear to get reproach by avowing regard for them.
Joh 7:14-24	<br>Every faithful minister may humbly adopt Christ's words. His doctrineis not his own finding out, but is from God's word, through theteaching of his Spirit. And amidst the disputes which disturb theworld, if any man, of any nation, seeks to do the will of God, he shallknow whether the doctrine is of God, or whether men speak ofthemselves. Only those who hate the truth shall be given up to errorswhich will be fatal. Surely it was as agreeable to the design of thesabbath to restore health to the afflicted, as to administer an outwardrite. Jesus told them to decide on his conduct according to thespiritual import of the Divine law. We must not judge concerning any bytheir outward appearance, but by their worth, and by the gifts andgraces of God's Spirit in them.
Joh 7:25-30	<br>Christ proclaimed aloud, that they were in error in their thoughtsabout his origin. He was sent of God, who showed himself true to hispromises. This declaration, that they knew not God, with his claim topeculiar knowledge, provoked the hearers; and they sought to take him,but God can tie men's hands, though he does not turn their hearts.
Joh 7:31-36	<br>The discourses of Jesus convinced many that he was the Messiah; butthey had not courage to own it. It is comfort to those who are in theworld, but not of it, and therefore are hated by it and weary of it,that they shall not be in it always, that they shall not be in it long.Our days being evil, it is well they are few. The days of life and ofgrace do not last long; and sinners, when in misery, will be glad ofthe help they now despise. Men dispute about such sayings, but theevent will explain them.
Joh 7:37-39	<br>On the last day of the feast of tabernacles, the Jews drew water andpoured it out before the Lord. It is supposed that Christ alluded tothis. If any man desires to be truly and for ever happy, let him applyto Christ, and be ruled by him. This thirst means strong desires afterspiritual blessings, which nothing else can satisfy; so the sanctifyingand comforting influences of the Holy Spirit, were intended by thewaters which Jesus called on them to come to Him and drink. The comfortflows plentifully and constantly as a river; strong as a stream to beardown the opposition of doubts and fears. There is a fulness in Christ,of grace for grace. The Spirit dwelling and working in believers, is asa fountain of living, running water, out of which plentiful streamsflow, cooling and cleansing as water. The miraculous gifts of the HolySpirit we do not expect, but for his more common and more valuableinfluences we may apply. These streams have flowed from our glorifiedRedeemer, down to this age, and to the remote corners of the earth. Maywe be anxious to make them known to others.
Joh 7:40-53	<br>The malice of Christ's enemies is always against reason, and sometimesthe staying of it cannot be accounted for. Never any man spake withthat wisdom, and power, and grace, that convincing clearness, and thatsweetness, wherewith Christ spake. Alas, that many, who are for a timerestrained, and who speak highly of the word of Jesus, speedily losetheir convictions, and go on in their sins! People are foolishly swayedby outward motives in matters of eternal moment, are willing even to bedamned for fashion's sake. As the wisdom of God often chooses thingswhich men despise, so the folly of men commonly despises those whom Godhas chosen. The Lord brings forward his weak and timid disciples, andsometimes uses them to defeat the designs of his enemies.
Joh 8:1-11	<br>Christ neither found fault with the law, nor excused the prisoner'sguilt; nor did he countenance the pretended zeal of the Pharisees.Those are self-condemned who judge others, and yet do the same thing.All who are any way called to blame the faults of others, areespecially concerned to look to themselves, and keep themselves pure.In this matter Christ attended to the great work about which he cameinto the world, that was, to bring sinners to repentance; not todestroy, but to save. He aimed to bring, not only the accused torepentance, by showing her his mercy, but the prosecutors also, byshowing them their sins; they thought to insnare him, he sought toconvince and convert them. He declined to meddle with the magistrate'soffice. Many crimes merit far more severe punishment than they meetwith; but we should not leave our own work, to take that upon ourselvesto which we are not called. When Christ sent her away, it was with thiscaution, Go, and sin no more. Those who help to save the life of acriminal, should help to save the soul with the same caution. Those aretruly happy, whom Christ does not condemn. Christ's favour to us in theforgiveness of past sins should prevail with us, Go then, and sin nomore.
Joh 8:12-16	<br>Christ is the Light of the world. God is light, and Christ is the imageof the invisible God. One sun enlightens the whole world; so does oneChrist, and there needs no more. What a dark dungeon would the world bewithout the sun! So would it be without Jesus, by whom light came intothe world. Those who follow Christ shall not walk in darkness. Theyshall not be left without the truths which are necessary to keep themfrom destroying error, and the directions in the way of duty, necessaryto keep them from condemning sin.
Joh 8:17-20	<br>If we knew Christ better, we should know the Father better. Thosebecome vain in their imaginations concerning God, who will not learn ofChrist. Those who know not his glory and grace, know not the Fatherthat sent him. The time of our departure out of the world, depends uponGod. Our enemies cannot hasten it any sooner, nor can our friends delayit any longer, than the time appointed of the Father. Every truebeliever can look up and say with pleasure, My times are in thy hand,and better there than in my own. To all God's purposes there is a time.
Joh 8:21-29	<br>Those that live in unbelief, are for ever undone, if they die inunbelief. The Jews belonged to this present evil world, but Jesus wasof a heavenly and Divine nature, so that his doctrine, kingdom, andblessings, would not suit their taste. But the curse of the law is doneaway to all that submit to the grace of the gospel. Nothing but thedoctrine of Christ's grace will be an argument powerful enough, andnone but the Spirit of Christ's grace will be an agent powerful enough,to turn us from sin to God; and that Spirit is given, and that doctrineis given, to work upon those only who believe in Christ. Some say, Whois this Jesus? They allow him to have been a Prophet, an excellentTeacher, and even more than a creature; but cannot acknowledge him asover all, God blessed for evermore. Will not this suffice? Jesus hereanswers the question. Is this to honour him as the Father? Does thisadmit his being the Light of the world, and the Life of men, one withthe Father? All shall know by their conversion, or in theircondemnation, that he always spake and did what pleased the Father,even when he claimed the highest honours to himself.
Joh 8:30-36	<br>Such power attended our Lord's words, that many were convinced, andprofessed to believe in him. He encouraged them to attend his teaching,rely on his promises, and obey his commands, notwithstanding alltemptations to evil. Thus doing, they would be his disciples truly; andby the teaching of his word and Spirit, they would learn where theirhope and strength lay. Christ spoke of spiritual liberty; but carnalhearts feel no other grievances than those that molest the body, anddistress their worldly affairs. Talk to them of their liberty andproperty, tell them of waste committed upon their lands, or damage doneto their houses, and they understand you very well; but speak of thebondage of sin, captivity to Satan, and liberty by Christ; tell ofwrong done to their precious souls, and the hazard of their eternalwelfare, then you bring strange things to their ears. Jesus plainlyreminded them, that the man who practised any sin, was, in fact, aslave to that sin, which was the case with most of them. Christ in thegospel offers us freedom, he has power to do this, and those whomChrist makes free are really so. But often we see persons disputingabout liberty of every kind, while they are slaves to some sinful lust.
Joh 8:37-40	<br>Our Lord opposed the proud and vain confidence of these Jews, showingthat their descent from Abraham could not profit those of a contraryspirit to him. Where the word of God has no place, no good is to beexpected; room is left there for all wickedness. A sick person whoturns from his physician, and will take neither remedies nor food, ispast hope of recovery. The truth both heals and nourishes the hearts ofthose who receive it. The truth taught by philosophers has not thispower and effect, but only the truth of God. Those who claim theprivileges of Abraham, must do Abraham's works; must be strangers andsojourners in this world; keep up the worship of God in their families,and always walk before God.
Joh 8:41-47	<br>Satan prompts men to excesses by which they murder themselves andothers, while what he puts into the mind tends to ruin men's souls. Heis the great promoter of falsehood of every kind. He is a liar, all histemptations are carried on by his calling evil good, and good evil, andpromising freedom in sin. He is the author of all lies; whom liarsresemble and obey, with whom all liars shall have their portion forever. The special lusts of the devil are spiritual wickedness, thelusts of the mind, and corrupt reasonings, pride and envy, wrath andmalice, enmity to good, and enticing others to evil. By the truth, hereunderstand the revealed will of God as to the salvation of men by JesusChrist, the truth Christ was now preaching, and which the Jews opposed.
Joh 8:48-53	<br>Observe Christ's disregard of the applause of men. those who are deadto the praises of men can bear their contempt. God will seek the honourof all who do not seek their own. In these verses we have the doctrineof the everlasting happiness of believers. We have the character of abeliever; he is one that keeps the sayings of the Lord Jesus. And theprivilege of a believer; he shall by no means see death for ever.Though now they cannot avoid seeing death, and tasting it also, yetthey shall shortly be where it will be no more forever, Ex 14:13.
Joh 8:54-59	<br>Christ and all that are his, depend upon God for honour. Men may beable to dispute about God, yet may not know him. Such as know not God,and obey not the gospel of Christ, are put together, 2Th 1:8. All whorightly know anything of Christ, earnestly desire to know more of him.Those who discern the dawn of the light of the Sun of Righteousness,wish to see his rising. "Before Abraham was, I AM." This speaks Abrahama creature, and our Lord the Creator; well, therefore, might he makehimself greater than Abraham. I AM, is the name of God, Ex 3:14; itspeaks his self-existence; he is the First and the Last, ever the same,Re 1:8. Thus he was not only before Abraham, but before all worlds, Pr8:23; Joh 1:1. As Mediator, he was the appointed Messiah, long beforeAbraham; the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world, Re 13:8. TheLord Jesus was made of God Wisdom, Righteousness, Sanctification, andRedemption, to Adam, and Abel, and all that lived and died by faith inhim, before Abraham. The Jews were about to stone Jesus for blasphemy,but he withdrew; by his miraculous power he passed through them unhurt.Let us stedfastly profess what we know and believe concerning God; andif heirs of Abraham's faith, we shall rejoice in looking forward tothat day when the Saviour shall appear in glory, to the confusion ofhis enemies, and to complete the salvation of all who believe in him.
Joh 9:1-7	<br>Christ cured many who were blind by disease or accident; here he curedone born blind. Thus he showed his power to help in the most desperatecases, and the work of his grace upon the souls of sinners, which givessight to those blind by nature. This poor man could not see Christ, butChrist saw him. And if we know or apprehend anything of Christ, it isbecause we were first known of him. Christ says of uncommon calamities,that they are not always to be looked on as special punishments of sin;sometimes they are for the glory of God, and to manifest his works. Ourlife is our day, in which it concerns us to do the work of the day. Wemust be busy, and not waste day-time; it will be time to rest when ourday is done, for it is but a day. The approach of death should quickenus to improve all our opportunities of doing and getting good. Whatgood we have an opportunity to do, we should do quickly. And he thatwill never do a good work till there is nothing to be objected against,will leave many a good work for ever undone, Ec 11:4. Christ magnifiedhis power, in making a blind man to see, doing that which one wouldthink more likely to make a seeing man blind. Human reason cannot judgeof the Lord's methods; he uses means and instruments that men despise.Those that would be healed by Christ must be ruled by him. He came backfrom the pool wondering and wondered at; he came seeing. Thisrepresents the benefits in attending on ordinances of Christ'sappointment; souls go weak, and come away strengthened; go doubting,and come away satisfied; go mourning, and come away rejoicing; goblind, and come away seeing.
Joh 9:8-12	<br>Those whose eyes are opened, and whose hearts are cleansed by grace,being known to be the same person, but widely different in character,live as monuments to the Redeemer's glory, and recommend his grace toall who desire the same precious salvation. It is good to observe theway and method of God's works, and they will appear the more wonderful.Apply this spiritually. In the work of grace wrought upon the soul wesee the change, but we see not the hand that makes it: the way of theSpirit is like that of the wind, which thou hearest the sound of, butcanst not tell whence it comes, nor whither it goes.
Joh 9:13-17	<br>Christ not only worked miracles on the sabbath, but in such a manner aswould give offence to the Jews, for he would not seem to yield to thescribes and Pharisees. Their zeal for mere rites consumed thesubstantial matters of religion; therefore Christ would not give placeto them. Also, works of necessity and mercy are allowed, and thesabbath rest is to be kept, in order to the sabbath work. How manyblind eyes have been opened by the preaching of the gospel on theLord's day! how many impotent souls cured on that day! Much unrighteousand uncharitable judging comes from men's adding their own fancies toGod's appointments. How perfect in wisdom and holiness was ourRedeemer, when his enemies could find nothing against him, but theoft-refuted charge of breaking the sabbath! May we be enabled, bywell-doing, to silence the ignorance of foolish men.
Joh 9:18-23	<br>The Pharisees vainly hoped to disprove this notable miracle. Theyexpected a Messiah, but could not bear to think that this Jesus shouldbe he, because his precepts were all contrary to their traditions, andbecause they expected a Messiah in outward pomp and splendour. The fearof man brings a snare, Pr 29:25, and often makes people deny and disownChrist and his truths and ways, and act against their consciences. Theunlearned and poor, who are simple-hearted, readily draw properinferences from the evidences of the light of the gospel; but thosewhose desires are another way, though ever learning, never come to theknowledge of the truth.
Joh 9:24-34	<br>As Christ's mercies are most valued by those who have felt the want ofthem, that have been blind, and now see; so the most powerful andlasting affections to Christ, arise from actual knowledge of him. Inthe work of grace in the soul, though we cannot tell when, and how, andby what steps the blessed change was wrought, yet we may take thecomfort, if we can say, through grace, Whereas I was blind, now I see.I did live a worldly, sensual life, but, thanks be to God, it is nowotherwise with me, Eph 5:8. The unbelief of those who enjoy the meansof knowledge and conviction, is indeed marvellous. All who have feltthe power and grace of the Lord Jesus, wonder at the wilfulness ofothers who reject him. He argues strongly against them, not only thatJesus was not a sinner, but that he was of God. We may each of us knowby this, whether we are of God or not. What do we? What do we for God?What do we for our souls? What do we more than others?
Joh 9:35-38	<br>Christ owns those who own him and his truth and ways. There isparticular notice taken of such a suffer in the cause of Christ, andfor the testimony of a good conscience. Our Lord Jesus graciouslyreveals himself to the man. Now he was made sensible what anunspeakable mercy it was, to be cured of his blindness, that he mightsee the Son of God. None but God is to be worshipped; so that inworshipping Jesus, he owned him to be God. All who believe in him, willworship him.
Joh 9:39-41	<br>Christ came into the world to give sight to those who were spirituallyblind. Also, that those who see might be made blind; that those whohave a high conceit of their own wisdom, might be sealed up inignorance. The preaching of the cross was thought to be folly by suchas by carnal wisdom knew not God. Nothing fortifies men's corrupthearts against the convictions of the word, more than the high opinionwhich others have of them; as if all that gained applause with men,must obtain acceptance with God. Christ silenced them. But the sin ofthe self-conceited and self-confident remains; they reject the gospelof grace, therefore the guilt of their sin remains unpardoned, and thepower of their sin remains unbroken.
Joh 10:1-5	<br>Here is a parable or similitude, taken from the customs of the East, inthe management of sheep. Men, as creatures depending on their Creator,are called the sheep of his pasture. The church of God in the world isas a sheep-fold, exposed to deceivers and persecutors. The greatShepherd of the sheep knows all that are his, guards them by hisprovidence, guides them by his Spirit and word, and goes before them,as the Eastern shepherds went before their sheep, to set them in theway of his steps. Ministers must serve the sheep in their spiritualconcerns. The Spirit of Christ will set before them an open door. Thesheep of Christ will observe their Shepherd, and be cautious and shy ofstrangers, who would draw them from faith in him to fancies about him.
Joh 10:6-9	<br>Many who hear the word of Christ, do not understand it, because theywill not. But we shall find one scripture expounding another, and theblessed Spirit making known the blessed Jesus. Christ is the Door. Andwhat greater security has the church of God than that the Lord Jesus isbetween it and all its enemies? He is a door open for passage andcommunication. Here are plain directions how to come into the fold; wemust come in by Jesus Christ as the Door. By faith in him as the greatMediator between God and man. Also, we have precious promises to thosethat observe this direction. Christ has all that care of his church,and every believer, which a good shepherd has of his flock; and heexpects the church, and every believer, to wait on him, and to keep inhis pasture.
Joh 10:10-18	<br>Christ is a good Shepherd; many who were not thieves, yet were carelessin their duty, and by their neglect the flock was much hurt. Badprinciples are the root of bad practices. The Lord Jesus knows whom hehas chosen, and is sure of them; they also know whom they have trusted,and are sure of Him. See here the grace of Christ; since none coulddemand his life of him, he laid it down of himself for our redemption.He offered himself to be the Saviour; Lo, I come. And the necessity ofour case calling for it, he offered himself for the Sacrifice. He wasboth the offerer and the offering, so that his laying down his life washis offering up himself. From hence it is plain, that he died in theplace and stead of men; to obtain their being set free from thepunishment of sin, to obtain the pardon of their sin; and that hisdeath should obtain that pardon. Our Lord laid not his life down forhis doctrine, but for his sheep.
Joh 10:19-21	<br>Satan ruins many, by putting them out of conceit with the word andordinances. Men would not be laughed out of their necessary food, yetsuffer themselves thus to be laughed out of what is far more necessary.If our zeal and earnestness in the cause of Christ, especially in theblessed work of bringing his sheep into his fold, bring upon us evilnames, let us not heed it, but remember our Master was thus reproachedbefore us.
Joh 10:22-30	<br>All who have any thing to say to Christ, may find him in the temple.Christ would make us to believe; we make ourselves doubt. The Jewsunderstood his meaning, but could not form his words into a full chargeagainst him. He described the gracious disposition and happy state ofhis sheep; they heard and believed his word, followed him as hisfaithful disciples, and none of them should perish; for the Son and theFather were one. Thus he was able to defend his sheep against all theirenemies, which proves that he claimed Divine power and perfectionequally with the Father.
Joh 10:31-38	<br>Christ's works of power and mercy proclaim him to be over all, Godblessed for evermore, that all may know and believe He is in theFather, and the Father in Him. Whom the Father sends, he sanctifies.The holy God will reward, and therefore will employ, none but such ashe makes holy. The Father was in the Son, so that by Divine power hewrought his miracles; the Son was so in the Father, that he knew thewhole of His mind. This we cannot by searching find out to perfection,but we may know and believe these declarations of Christ.
Joh 10:39-42	<br>No weapon formed against our Lord Jesus shall prosper. He escaped, notbecause he was afraid to suffer, but because his hour was not come. AndHe who knew how to deliver himself, knows how to deliver the godly ourof their temptations, and to make a way for them to escape. Persecutorsmay drive Christ and his gospel our of their own city or country, butthey cannot drive him or it out of the world. When we know Christ byfaith in our hearts, we find all that the Scripture saith of him istrue.
Joh 11:1-6	<br>It is no new thing for those whom Christ loves, to be sick; bodilydistempers correct the corruption, and try the graces of God's people.He came not to preserve his people from these afflictions, but to savethem from their sins, and from the wrath to come; however, it behovesus to apply to Him in behalf of our friends and relatives when sick andafflicted. Let this reconcile us to the darkest dealings of Providence,that they are all for the glory of God: sickness, loss, disappointment,are so; and if God be glorified, we ought to be satisfied. Jesus lovedMartha, and her sister, and Lazarus. The families are greatly favouredin which love and peace abound; but those are most happy whom Jesusloves, and by whom he is beloved. Alas, that this should seldom be thecase with every person, even in small families. God has graciousintentions, even when he seems to delay. When the work of deliverance,temporal or spiritual, public or personal, is delayed, it does but stayfor the right time.
Joh 11:7-10	<br>Christ never brings his people into any danger but he goes with them init. We are apt to think ourselves zealous for the Lord, when really weare only zealous for our wealth, credit, ease, and safety; we havetherefore need to try our principles. But our day shall be lengthenedout, till our work is done, and our testimony finished. A man hascomfort and satisfaction while in the way of his duty, as set forth bythe word of God, and determined by the providence of God. Christ,wherever he went, walked in the day; and so shall we, if we follow hissteps. If a man walks in the way of his heart, and according to thecourse of this world, if he consults his own carnal reasonings morethan the will and glory of God, he falls into temptations and snares.He stumbles, because there is no light in him; for light in us is toour moral actions, that which light about us to our natural actions.
Joh 11:11-16	<br>Since we are sure to rise again at the last, why should not thebelieving hope of that resurrection to eternal life, make it as easyfor us to put off the body and die, as it is to put off our clothes andgo to sleep? A true Christian, when he dies, does but sleep; he restsfrom the labours of the past day. Nay, herein death is better thansleep, that sleep is only a short rest, but death is the end of earthlycares and toils. The disciples thought that it was now needless forChrist to go to Lazarus, and expose himself and them. Thus we oftenhope that the good work we are called to do, will be done by some otherhand, if there be peril in the doing of it. But when Christ raisedLazarus from the dead, many were brought to believe on him; and therewas much done to make perfect the faith of those that believed. Let usgo to him; death cannot separate from the love of Christ, nor put usout of the reach of his call. Like Thomas, in difficult timesChristians should encourage one another. The dying of the Lord Jesusshould make us willing to die whenever God calls us.
Joh 11:17-32	<br>Here was a house where the fear of God was, and on which his blessingrested; yet it was made a house of mourning. Grace will keep sorrowfrom the heart, but not from the house. When God, by his grace andprovidence, is coming towards us in ways of mercy and comfort, weshould, like Martha, go forth by faith, hope, and prayer, to meet him.When Martha went to meet Jesus, Mary sat still in the house; thistemper formerly had been an advantage to her, when it put her atChrist's feet to hear his word; but in the day of affliction, the sametemper disposed her to melancholy. It is our wisdom to watch againstthe temptations, and to make use of the advantages of our naturaltempers. When we know not what in particular to ask or expect, let usrefer ourselves to God; let him do as seemeth him good. To enlargeMartha's expectations, our Lord declared himself to be the Resurrectionand the Life. In every sense he is the Resurrection; the source, thesubstance, the first-fruits, the cause of it. The redeemed soul livesafter death in happiness; and after the resurrection, both body andsoul are kept from all evil for ever. When we have read or heard theword of Christ, about the great things of the other world, we shouldput it to ourselves, Do we believe this truth? The crosses and comfortsof this present time would not make such a deep impression upon us asthey do, if we believed the things of eternity as we ought. When Christour Master comes, he calls for us. He comes in his word and ordinances,and calls us to them, calls us by them, calls us to himself. Those who,in a day of peace, set themselves at Christ's feet to be taught by him,may with comfort, in a day of trouble, cast themselves at his feet, tofind favour with him.
Joh 11:33-46	<br>Christ's tender sympathy with these afflicted friends, appeared by thetroubles of his spirit. In all the afflictions of believers he isafflicted. His concern for them was shown by his kind inquiry after theremains of his deceased friend. Being found in fashion as a man, heacts in the way and manner of the sons of men. It was shown by histears. He was a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief. Tears ofcompassion resemble those of Christ. But Christ never approved thatsensibility of which many are proud, while they weep at mere tales ofdistress, but are hardened to real woe. He sets us an example towithdraw from scenes of giddy mirth, that we may comfort the afflicted.And we have not a High Priest who cannot be touched with a feeling ofour infirmities. It is a good step toward raising a soul to spirituallife, when the stone is taken away, when prejudices are removed, andgot over, and way is made for the word to enter the heart. If we takeChrist's word, and rely on his power and faithfulness, we shall see theglory of God, and be happy in the sight. Our Lord Jesus has taught us,by his own example, to call God Father, in prayer, and to draw nigh tohim as children to a father, with humble reverence, yet with holyboldness. He openly made this address to God, with uplifted eyes andloud voice, that they might be convinced the Father had sent him as hisbeloved Son into the world. He could have raised Lazarus by the silentexertion of his power and will, and the unseen working of the Spirit oflife; but he did it by a loud call. This was a figure of the gospelcall, by which dead souls are brought out of the grave of sin: and ofthe sound of the archangel's trumpet at the last day, with which allthat sleep in the dust shall be awakened, and summoned before the greattribunal. The grave of sin and this world, is no place for those whomChrist has quickened; they must come forth. Lazarus was thoroughlyrevived, and returned not only to life, but to health. The sinnercannot quicken his own soul, but he is to use the means of grace; thebeliever cannot sanctify himself, but he is to lay aside every weightand hinderance. We cannot convert our relatives and friends, but weshould instruct, warn, and invite them.
Joh 11:47-53	<br>There can hardly be a more clear discovery of the madness that is inman's heart, and of its desperate enmity against God, than what is hererecorded. Words of prophecy in the mouth, are not clear evidence of aprinciple of grace in the heart. The calamity we seek to escape by sin,we take the most effectual course to bring upon our own heads; as thosedo who think by opposing Christ's kingdom, to advance their own worldlyinterest. The fear of the wicked shall come upon them. The conversionof souls is the gathering of them to Christ as their ruler and refuge;and he died to effect this. By dying he purchased them to himself, andthe gift of the Holy Ghost for them: his love in dying for believersshould unite them closely together.
Joh 11:54-57	<br>Before our gospel passover we must renew our repentance. Thus by avoluntary purification, and by religious exercises, many, more devoutthan their neighbours, spent some time before the passover atJerusalem. When we expect to meet God, we must solemnly prepare. Nodevices of man can alter the purposes of God: and while hypocritesamuse themselves with forms and disputes, and worldly men pursue theirown plans, Jesus still orders all things for his own glory and thesalvation of his people.
Joh 12:1-11	<br>Christ had formerly blamed Martha for being troubled with much serving.But she did not leave off serving, as some, who when found fault withfor going too far in one way, peevishly run too far another way; shestill served, but within hearing of Christ's gracious words. Mary gavea token of love to Christ, who had given real tokens of his love to herand her family. God's Anointed should be our Anointed. Has God pouredon him the oil of gladness above his fellows, let us pour on him theointment of our best affections. In Judas a foul sin is gilded overwith a plausible pretence. We must not think that those do noacceptable service, who do it not in our way. The reigning love ofmoney is heart-theft. The grace of Christ puts kind comments on piouswords and actions, makes the best of what is amiss, and the most ofwhat is good. Opportunities are to be improved; and those first andmost vigorously, which are likely to be the shortest. To consult tohinder the further effect of the miracle, by putting Lazarus to death,is such wickedness, malice, and folly, as cannot be explained, exceptby the desperate enmity of the human heart against God. They resolvedthat the man should die whom the Lord had raised to life. The successof the gospel often makes wicked men so angry, that they speak and actas if they hoped to obtain a victory over the Almighty himself.
Joh 12:12-19	<br>Christ's riding in triumph to Jerusalem is recorded by all theevangelists. Many excellent things, both in the word and providence ofGod, disciples do not understand at their first acquaintance with thethings of God. The right understanding of spiritual nature of Christ'skingdom, prevents our misapplying the Scriptures which speak of it.
Joh 12:20-26	<br>In attendance upon holy ordinances, particularly the gospel passover,the great desire of our souls should be to see Jesus; to see him asours, to keep up communion with him, and derive grace from him. Thecalling of the Gentiles magnified the Redeemer. A corn of wheat yieldsno increase unless it is cast into the ground. Thus Christ might havepossessed his heavenly glory alone, without becoming man. Or, after hehad taken man's nature, he might have entered heaven alone, by his ownperfect righteousness, without suffering or death; but then no sinnerof the human race could have been saved. The salvation of soulshitherto, and henceforward to the end of time, is owing to the dying ofthis Corn of wheat. Let us search whether Christ be in us the hope ofglory; let us beg him to make us indifferent to the trifling concernsof this life, that we may serve the Lord Jesus with a willing mind, andfollow his holy example.
Joh 12:27-33	<br>The sin of our souls was the troubled of Christ's soul, when heundertook to redeem and save us, and to make his soul an offering forour sin. Christ was willing to suffer, yet prayed to be saved fromsuffering. Prayer against trouble may well agree with patience underit, and submission to the will of God in it. Our Lord Jesus undertookto satisfy God's injured honour, and he did it by humbling himself. Thevoice of the Father from heaven, which had declared him to be hisbeloved Son, at his baptism, and when he was transfigured, was heardproclaiming that He had both glorified his name, and would glorify it.Christ, reconciling the world to God by the merit of his death, brokethe power of death, and cast out Satan as a destroyer. Christ, bringingthe world to God by the doctrine of his cross, broke the power of sin,and cast out Satan as a deceiver. The soul that was at a distance fromChrist, is brought to love him and trust him. Jesus was now going toheaven, and he would draw men's hearts to him thither. There is powerin the death of Christ to draw souls to him. We have heard from thegospel that which exalts free grace, and we have heard also that whichenjoins duty; we must from the heart embrace both, and not separatethem.
Joh 12:34-36	<br>The people drew false notions from the Scriptures, because theyoverlooked the prophecies that spoke of Christ's sufferings and death.Our Lord warned them that the light would not long continue with them,and exhorted them to walk in it, before the darkness overtook them.Those who would walk in the light must believe in it, and followChrist's directions. But those who have not faith, cannot behold whatis set forth in Jesus, lifted up on the cross, and must be strangers toits influence as made known by the Holy Spirit; they find a thousandobjections to excuse their unbelief.
Joh 12:37-43	<br>Observe the method of conversion implied here. Sinners are brought tosee the reality of Divine things, and to have some knowledge of them.To be converted, and truly turned from sin to Christ, as theirHappiness and Portion. God will heal them, will justify and sanctifythem; will pardon their sins, which are as bleeding wounds, and mortifytheir corruptions, which are as lurking diseases. See the power of theworld in smothering convictions, from regard to the applause or censureof men. Love of the praise of men, as a by-end in that which is good,will make a man a hypocrite when religion is in fashion, and credit isto be got by it; and love of the praise of men, as a base principle inthat which is evil, will make a man an apostate, when religion is indisgrace, and credit is to be lost for it.
Joh 12:44-50	<br>Our Lord publicly proclaimed, that every one who believed on him, ashis true disciple, did not believe on him only, but on the Father whosent him. Beholding in Jesus the glory of the Father, we learn to obey,love, and trust in him. By daily looking to Him, who came a Light intothe world, we are more and more freed from the darkness of ignorance,error, sin, and misery; we learn that the command of God our Saviour iseverlasting life. But the same word will seal the condemnation of allwho despise it, or neglect it.
Joh 13:1-17	<br>Our Lord Jesus has a people in the world that are his own; he haspurchased them, and paid dear for them, and he has set them apart forhimself; they devote themselves to him as a peculiar people. Those whomChrist loves, he loves to the end. Nothing can separate a true believerfrom the love of Christ. We know not when our hour will come, thereforewhat we have to do in constant preparation for it, ought never to beundone. What way of access the devil has to men's hearts we cannottell. But some sins are so exceedingly sinful, and there is so littletemptation to them from the world and the flesh, that it is plain theyare directly from Satan. Jesus washed his disciples' feet, that hemight teach us to think nothing below us, wherein we may promote God'sglory, and the good of our brethren. We must address ourselves to duty,and must lay aside every thing that would hinder us in what we have todo. Christ washed his disciples' feet, that he might signify to themthe value of spiritual washing, and the cleansing of the soul from thepollutions of sin. Our Lord Jesus does many things of which even hisown disciples do not for the present know the meaning, but they shallknow afterward. We see in the end what was the kindness from eventswhich seemed most cross. And it is not humility, but unbelief, to putaway the offers of the gospel, as if too rich to be made to us, or toogood news to be true. All those, and those only, who are spirituallywashed by Christ, have a part in Christ. All whom Christ owns andsaves, he justifies and sanctifies. Peter more than submits; he begs tobe washed by Christ. How earnest he is for the purifying grace of theLord Jesus, and the full effect of it, even upon his hands and head!Those who truly desire to be sanctified, desire to be sanctifiedthroughout, to have the whole man, with all its parts and powers, madepure. The true believer is thus washed when he receives Christ for hissalvation. See then what ought to be the daily care of those whothrough grace are in a justified state, and that is, to wash theirfeet; to cleanse themselves from daily guilt, and to watch againsteverything defiling. This should make us the more cautious. Fromyesterday's pardon, we should be strengthened against this day'stemptation. And when hypocrites are discovered, it should be nosurprise or cause of stumbling to us. Observe the lesson Christ heretaught. Duties are mutual; we must both accept help from our brethren,and afford help to our brethren. When we see our Master serving, wecannot but see how ill it becomes us to domineer. And the same lovewhich led Christ to ransom and reconcile his disciples when enemies,still influences him.
Joh 13:18-30	<br>Our Lord had often spoken of his own sufferings and death, without suchtrouble of spirit as he now discovered when he spake of Judas. The sinsof Christians are the grief of Christ. We are not to confine ourattention to Judas. The prophecy of his treachery may apply to all whopartake of God's mercies, and meet them with ingratitude. See theinfidel, who only looks at the Scriptures with a desire to do awaytheir authority and destroy their influence; the hypocrite, whoprofesses to believe the Scriptures, but will not govern himself bythem; and the apostate, who turns aside from Christ for a thing ofnaught. Thus mankind, supported by God's providence, after eating breadwith Him, lift up the heel against Him! Judas went out as one weary ofJesus and his apostles. Those whose deeds are evil, love darknessrather than light.
Joh 13:31-35	<br>Christ had been glorified in many miracles he wrought, yet he speaks ofhis being glorified now in his sufferings, as if that were more thanall his other glories in his humbled state. Satisfaction was therebymade for the wrong done to God by the sin of man. We cannot now followour Lord to his heavenly happiness, but if we truly believe in him, weshall follow him hereafter; meanwhile we must wait his time, and do hiswork. Before Christ left the disciples, he would give them a newcommandment. They were to love each other for Christ's sake, andaccording to his example, seeking what might benefit others, andpromoting the cause of the gospel, as one body, animated by one soul.But this commandment still appears new to many professors. Men ingeneral notice any of Christ's words rather than these. By this itappears, that if the followers of Christ do not show love one toanother, they give cause to suspect their sincerity.
Joh 13:36-38	<br>What Christ had said concerning brotherly love, Peter overlooked, butspoke of that about which Christ kept them ignorant. It is common to bemore eager to know about secret things, which belong to God only, thanabout things revealed, which belong to us and our children; to be moredesirous to have our curiosity gratified, than our consciencesdirected; to know what is done in heaven, than what we may do to getthither. How soon discourse as to what is plain and edifying isdropped, while a doubtful dispute runs on into endless strife of words!We are apt to take it amiss to be told we cannot do this and the other,whereas, without Christ we can do nothing. Christ knows us better thanwe know ourselves, and has many ways of discovering those tothemselves, whom he loves, and he will hide pride from them. May weendeavour to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace, to loveone another with a pure heart fervently, and to walk humbly with ourGod.
Joh 14:1-11	<br>Here are three words, upon any of which stress may be laid. Upon theword troubled. Be not cast down and disquieted. The word heart. Letyour heart be kept with full trust in God. The word your. Howeverothers are overwhelmed with the sorrows of this present time, be notyou so. Christ's disciples, more than others, should keep their mindsquiet, when everything else is unquiet. Here is the remedy against thistrouble of mind, "Believe." By believing in Christ as the Mediatorbetween God and man, we gain comfort. The happiness of heaven is spokenof as in a father's house. There are many mansions, for there are manysons to be brought to glory. Mansions are lasting dwellings. Christwill be the Finisher of that of which he is the Author or Beginner; ifhe have prepared the place for us, he will prepare us for it. Christ isthe sinner's Way to the Father and to heaven, in his person as Godmanifest in the flesh, in his atoning sacrifice, and as our Advocate.He is the Truth, as fulfilling all the prophecies of a Saviour;believing which, sinners come by him the Way. He is the Life, by whoselife-giving Spirit the dead in sin are quickened. Nor can any man drawnigh God as a Father, who is not quickened by Him as the Life, andtaught by Him as the Truth, to come by Him as the Way. By Christ, asthe Way, our prayers go to God, and his blessings come to us; this isthe Way that leads to rest, the good old Way. He is the Resurrectionand the Life. All that saw Christ by faith, saw the Father in Him. Inthe light of Christ's doctrine, they saw God as the Father of lights;and in Christ's miracles, they saw God as the God of power. Theholiness of God shone in the spotless purity of Christ's life. We areto believe the revelation of God to man in Christ; for the works of theRedeemer show forth his own glory, and God in him.
Joh 14:12-17	<br>Whatever we ask in Christ's name, that shall be for our good, andsuitable to our state, he shall give it to us. To ask in Christ's name,is to plead his merit and intercession, and to depend upon that plea.The gift of the Spirit is a fruit of Christ's mediation, bought by hismerit, and received by his intercession. The word used here, signifiesan advocate, counsellor, monitor, and comforter. He would abide withthe disciples to the end of time; his gifts and graces would encouragetheir hearts. The expressions used here and elsewhere, plainly denote aperson, and the office itself includes all the Divine perfections. Thegift of the Holy Ghost is bestowed upon the disciples of Christ, andnot on the world. This is the favour God bears to his chosen. As thesource of holiness and happiness, the Holy Spirit will abide with everybeliever for ever.
Joh 14:18-24	<br>Christ promises that he would continue his care of his disciples. Iwill not leave you orphans, or fatherless, for though I leave you, yetI leave you this comfort, I will come to you. I will come speedily toyou at my resurrection. I will come daily to you in my Spirit; in thetokens of his love, and visits of his grace. I will come certainly atthe end of time. Those only that see Christ with an eye of faith, shallsee him for ever: the world sees him no more till his second coming;but his disciples have communion with him in his absence. Thesemysteries will be fully known in heaven. It is a further act of grace,that they should know it, and have the comfort of it. Having Christ'scommands, we must keep them. And having them in our heads, we must keepthem in our hearts and lives. The surest evidence of our love to Christis, obedience to the laws of Christ. There are spiritual tokens ofChrist and his love given to all believers. Where sincere love toChrist is in the heart, there will be obedience. Love will be acommanding, constraining principle; and where love is, duty followsfrom a principle of gratitude. God will not only love obedientbelievers, but he will take pleasure in loving them, will rest in loveto them. He will be with them as his home. These privileges areconfined to those whose faith worketh by love, and whose love to Jesusleads them to keep his commandments. Such are partakers of the HolySpirit's new-creating grace.
Joh 14:25-27	<br>Would we know these things for our good, we must pray for, and dependon the teaching of the Holy Ghost; thus the words of Jesus will bebrought to our remembrance, and many difficulties be cleared up whichare not plain to others. To all the saints, the Spirit of grace isgiven to be a remembrancer, and to him, by faith and prayer, we shouldcommit the keeping of what we hear and know. Peace is put for all good,and Christ has left us all that is really and truly good, all thepromised good; peace of mind from our justification before God. ThisChrist calls his peace, for he is himself our Peace. The peace of Godwidely differs from that of Pharisees or hypocrites, as is shown by itshumbling and holy effects.
Joh 14:28-31	<br>Christ raises the expectations of his disciples to something beyondwhat they thought was their greatest happiness. His time was now short,he therefore spake largely to them. When we come to be sick, and todie, we may not be capable of talking much to those about us; such goodcounsel as we have to give, let us give while in health. Observe theprospect Christ had of an approaching conflict, not only with men, butwith the powers of darkness. Satan has something in us to perplex uswith, for we have all sinned; but when he would disturb Christ, hefound nothing sinful to help him. The best evidence of our love to theFather is, our doing as he has commanded us. Let us rejoice in theSaviour's victories over Satan the prince of this world. Let us copythe example of his love and obedience.
Joh 15:1-8	<br>Jesus Christ is the Vine, the true Vine. The union of the human andDivine natures, and the fulness of the Spirit that is in him, resemblethe root of the vine made fruitful by the moisture from a rich soil.Believers are branches of this Vine. The root is unseen, and our lifeis hid with Christ; the root bears the tree, diffuses sap to it, and inChrist are all supports and supplies. The branches of the vine aremany, yet, meeting in the root, are all but one vine; thus all trueChristians, though in place and opinion distant from each other, meetin Christ. Believers, like the branches of the vine, are weak, andunable to stand but as they are borne up. The Father is the Husbandman.Never was any husbandman so wise, so watchful, about his vineyard, asGod is about his church, which therefore must prosper. We must befruitful. From a vine we look for grapes, and from a Christian we lookfor a Christian temper, disposition, and life. We must honour God, anddo good; this is bearing fruit. The unfruitful are taken away. And evenfruitful branches need pruning; for the best have notions, passions,and humours, that require to be taken away, which Christ has promisedto forward the sanctification of believers, they will be thankful, forthem. The word of Christ is spoken to all believers; and there is acleansing virtue in that word, as it works grace, and works outcorruption. And the more fruit we bring forth, the more we abound inwhat is good, the more our Lord is glorified. In order to fruitfulness,we must abide in Christ, must have union with him by faith. It is thegreat concern of all Christ's disciples, constantly to keep updependence upon Christ, and communion with him. True Christians find byexperience, that any interruption in the exercise of their faith,causes holy affections to decline, their corruptions to revive, andtheir comforts to droop. Those who abide not in Christ, though they mayflourish for awhile in outward profession, yet come to nothing. Thefire is the fittest place for withered branches; they are good fornothing else. Let us seek to live more simply on the fulness of Christ,and to grow more fruitful in every good word and work, so may our joyin Him and in his salvation be full.
Joh 15:9-17	<br>Those whom God loves as a Father, may despise the hatred of all theworld. As the Father loved Christ, who was most worthy, so he loved hisdisciples, who were unworthy. All that love the Saviour should continuein their love to him, and take all occasions to show it. The joy of thehypocrite is but for a moment, but the joy of those who abide inChrist's love is a continual feast. They are to show their love to himby keeping his commandments. If the same power that first shed abroadthe love of Christ's in our hearts, did not keep us in that love, weshould not long abide in it. Christ's love to us should direct us tolove each other. He speaks as about to give many things in charge, yetnames this only; it includes many duties.
Joh 15:18-25	<br>How little do many persons think, that in opposing the doctrine ofChrist as our Prophet, Priest, and King, they prove themselves ignorantof the one living and true God, whom they profess to worship! The nameinto which Christ's disciples were baptized, is that which they willlive and die by. It is a comfort to the greatest sufferers, if theysuffer for Christ's name's sake. The world's ignorance is the truecause of its hatred to the disciples of Jesus. The clearer and fullerthe discoveries of the grace and truth of Christ, the greater is oursin if we do not love him and believe in him.
Joh 15:26,27	<br>The blessed Spirit will maintain the cause of Christ in the world,notwithstanding the opposition it meets with. Believers taught andencouraged by his influences, would bear testimony to Christ and hissalvation.
Joh 16:1-6	<br>Our Lord Jesus, by giving his disciples notice of trouble, designedthat the terror might not be a surprise to them. It is possible forthose who are real enemies to God's service, to pretend zeal for it.This does not lessen the sin of the persecutors; villanies will neverbe changed by putting the name of God to them. As Jesus in hissufferings, so his followers in theirs, should look to the fulfillingof Scripture. He did not tell them sooner, because he was with them toteach, guide, and comfort them; they needed not then this promise ofthe Holy Spirit's presence. It will silence us to ask, Whence troublescome? It will satisfy us to ask, Whither go they? for we know they workfor good. It is the common fault and folly of melancholy Christians tolook only on the dark side of the cloud, and to turn a deaf ear to thevoice of joy and gladness. That which filled the disciples' hearts withsorrow, was too great affection for this present life. Nothing morehinders our joy in God, than the love of the world, and the sorrow ofthe world which comes from it.
Joh 16:7-15	<br>Christ's departure was necessary to the Comforter's coming. Sending theSpirit was to be the fruit of Christ's death, which was his going away.His bodily presence could be only in one place at one time, but hisSpirit is every where, in all places, at all times, wherever two orthree are gathered together in his name. See here the office of theSpirit, first to reprove, or to convince. Convincing work is theSpirit's work; he can do it effectually, and none but he. It is themethod the Holy Spirit takes, first to convince, and then to comfort.The Spirit shall convince the world, of sin; not merely tell them ofit. The Spirit convinces of the fact of sin; of the fault of sin; ofthe folly of sin; of the filth of sin, that by it we are become hatefulto God; of the fountain of sin, the corrupt nature; and lastly, of thefruit of sin, that the end thereof is death. The Holy Spirit provesthat all the world is guilty before God. He convinces the world ofrighteousness; that Jesus of Nazareth was Christ the righteous. Also,of Christ's righteousness, imparted to us for justification andsalvation. He will show them where it is to be had, and how they may beaccepted as righteous in God's sight. Christ's ascension proves theransom was accepted, and the righteousness finished, through whichbelievers were to be justified. Of judgment, because the prince of thisworld is judged. All will be well, when his power is broken, who madeall the mischief. As Satan is subdued by Christ, this gives usconfidence, for no other power can stand before him. And of the day ofjudgment. The coming of the Spirit would be of unspeakable advantage tothe disciples. The Holy Spirit is our Guide, not only to show us theway, but to go with us by continued aids and influences. To be led intoa truth is more than barely to know it; it is not only to have thenotion of it in our heads, but the relish, and savour, and power of itin our hearts. He shall teach all truth, and keep back nothingprofitable, for he will show things to come. All the gifts and gracesof the Spirit, all the preaching, and all the writing of the apostles,under the influence of the Spirit, all the tongues, and miracles, wereto glorify Christ. It behoves every one to ask, whether the Holy Spirithas begun a good work in his heart? Without clear discovery of ourguilt and danger, we never shall understand the value of Christ'ssalvation; but when brought to know ourselves aright, we begin to seethe value of the Redeemer. We should have fuller views of the Redeemer,and more lively affections to him, if we more prayed for, and dependedon the Holy Spirit.
Joh 16:16-22	<br>It is good to consider how near our seasons of grace are to an end,that we may be quickened to improve them. But the sorrows of thedisciples would soon be turned into joy; as those of a mother, at thesight of her infant. The Holy Spirit would be their Comforter, andneither men nor devils, neither sufferings in life nor in death, wouldever deprive them of their joy. Believers have joy or sorrow, accordingto their sight of Christ, and the tokens of his presence. Sorrow iscoming on the ungodly, which nothing can lessen; the believer is anheir to joy which no one can take away. Where now is the joy of themurderers of our Lord, and the sorrow of his friends?
Joh 16:23-27	<br>Asking of the Father shows a sense of spiritual wants, and a desire ofspiritual blessings, with conviction that they are to be had from Godonly. Asking in Christ's name, is acknowledging our unworthiness toreceive any favours from God, and shows full dependence upon Christ asthe Lord our Righteousness. Our Lord had hitherto spoken in short andweighty sentences, or in parables, the import of which the disciplesdid not fully understand, but after his resurrection he intendedplainly to teach them such things as related to the Father and the wayto him, through his intercession. And the frequency with which our Lordenforces offering up petitions in his name, shows that the great end ofthe mediation of Christ is to impress us with a deep sense of oursinfulness, and of the merit and power of his death, whereby we haveaccess to God. And let us ever remember, that to address the Father inthe name of Christ, or to address the Son as God dwelling in humannature, and reconciling the world to himself, are the same, as theFather and Son are one.
Joh 16:28-33	<br>Here is a plain declaration of Christ's coming from the Father, and hisreturn to him. The Redeemer, in his entrance, was God manifest in theflesh, and in his departure was received up into glory. By this sayingthe disciples improved in knowledge. Also in faith; "Now are we sure."Alas! they knew not their own weakness. The Divine nature did notdesert the human nature, but supported it, and put comfort and valueinto Christ's sufferings. And while we have God's favourable presence,we are happy, and ought to be easy, though all the world forsake us.Peace in Christ is the only true peace, in him alone believers have it.Through him we have peace with God, and so in him we have peace in ourown minds. We ought to be encouraged, because Christ has overcome theworld before us. But while we think we stand, let us take heed lest wefall. We know not how we should act if brought into temptation; let uswatch and pray without ceasing, that we may not be left to ourselves.
Joh 17:1-5	<br>Our Lord prayed as a man, and as the Mediator of his people; yet hespoke with majesty and authority, as one with and equal to the Father.Eternal life could not be given to believers, unless Christ, theirSurety, both glorified the Father, and was glorified of him. This isthe sinner's way to eternal life, and when this knowledge shall be madeperfect, holiness and happiness will be fully enjoyed. The holiness andhappiness of the redeemed, are especially that glory of Christ, and ofhis Father, which was the joy set before him, for which he endured thecross and despised the shame; this glory was the end of the sorrow ofhis soul, and in obtaining it he was fully satisfied. Thus we aretaught that our glorifying God is needed as an evidence of our interestin Christ, through whom eternal life is God's free gift.
Joh 17:6-10	<br>Christ prays for those that are his. Thou gavest them me, as sheep tothe shepherd, to be kept; as a patient to the physician, to be cured;as children to a tutor, to be taught: thus he will deliver up hischarge. It is a great satisfaction to us, in our reliance upon Christ,that he, all he is and has, and all he said and did, all he is doingand will do, are of God. Christ offered this prayer for his peoplealone as believers; not for the world at large. Yet no one who desiresto come to the Father, and is conscious that he is unworthy to come inhis own name, need be discouraged by the Saviour's declaration, for heis both able and willing to save to the uttermost, all that come untoGod by him. Earnest convictions and desires, are hopeful tokens of awork already wrought in a man; they begin to evidence that he has beenchosen unto salvation, through sanctification of the Spirit and beliefof the truth. They are thine; wilt thou not provide for thine own? Wiltthou not secure them? Observe the foundation on which this plea isgrounded, All mine are thine, and thine are mine. This speaks theFather and Son to be one. All mine are thine. The Son owns none forhis, that are not devoted to the service of the Father.
Joh 17:11-16	<br>Christ does not pray that they might be rich and great in the world,but that they might be kept from sin, strengthened for their duty, andbrought safe to heaven. The prosperity of the soul is the bestprosperity. He pleaded with his holy Father, that he would keep them byhis power and for his glory, that they might be united in affection andlabours, even according to the union of the Father and the Son. He didnot pray that his disciples should be removed out of the world, thatthey might escape the rage of men, for they had a great work to do forthe glory of God, and the benefit of mankind. But he prayed that theFather would keep them from the evil, from being corrupted by theworld, the remains of sin in their hearts, and from the power and craftof Satan. So that they might pass through the world as through anenemy's country, as he had done. They are not left here to pursue thesame objects as the men around them, but to glorify God, and to servetheir generation. The Spirit of God in true Christians is opposed tothe spirit of the world.
Joh 17:17-19	<br>Christ next prayed for the disciples, that they might not only be keptfrom evil, but made good. It is the prayer of Jesus for all that arehis, that they may be made holy. Even disciples must pray forsanctifying grace. The means of giving this grace is, "through thytruth, thy word is truth." Sanctify them, set them apart for thyselfand thy service. Own them in the office; let thy hand go with them.Jesus entirely devoted himself to his undertaking, and all the parts ofit, especially the offering up himself without spot unto God, by theeternal Spirit. The real holiness of all true Christians is the fruitof Christ's death, by which the gift of the Holy Ghost was purchased;he gave himself for his church, to sanctify it. If our views have notthis effect on us, they are not Divine truth, or we do not receive themby a living and a working faith, but as mere notions.
Joh 17:20-23	<br>Our Lord especially prayed, that all believers might be as one bodyunder one head, animated by one soul, by their union with Christ andthe Father in him, through the Holy Spirit dwelling in them. The morethey dispute about lesser things, the more they throw doubts uponChristianity. Let us endeavour to keep the unity of the Spirit in thebond of peace, praying that all believers may be more and more unitedin one mind and one judgment. Thus shall we convince the world of thetruth and excellence of our religion, and find more sweet communionwith God and his saints.
Joh 17:24-26	<br>Christ, as one with the Father, claimed on behalf of all that had beengiven to him, and should in due time believe on him, that they shouldbe brought to heaven; and that there the whole company of the redeemedmight behold his glory as their beloved Friend and Brother, and thereinfind happiness. He had declared and would further declare the name orcharacter of God, by his doctrine and his Spirit, that, being one withhim, the love of the Father to him might abide with them also. Thus,being joined to Him by one Spirit, they might be filled with all thefulness of God, and enjoy a blessedness of which we can form no rightidea in our present state.
Joh 18:1-12	<br>Sin began in the garden of Eden, there the curse was pronounced, therethe Redeemer was promised; and in a garden that promised Seed enteredinto conflict with the old serpent. Christ was buried also in a garden.Let us, when we walk in our gardens, take occasion from thence tomediate on Christ's sufferings in a garden. Our Lord Jesus, knowing allthings that should come upon him, went forth and asked, Whom seek ye?When the people would have forced him to a crown, he withdrew, ch.6:15, but when they came to force him to a cross, he offered himself;for he came into this world to suffer, and went to the other world toreign. He showed plainly what he could have done; when he struck themdown he could have struck them dead, but he would not do so. It musthave been the effect of Divine power, that the officers and soldierslet the disciples go away quietly, after the resistance which had beenoffered. Christ set us an example of meekness in sufferings, and apattern of submission to God's will in every thing that concerns us. Itis but a cup, a small matter. It is a cup that is given us; sufferingsare gifts. It is given us by a Father, who has a father's authority,and does us no wrong; a father's affection, and means us no hurt. Fromthe example of our Saviour we should learn how to receive our lighterafflictions, and to ask ourselves whether we ought to oppose ourFather's will, or to distrust his love. We were bound with the cords ofour iniquities, with the yoke of our transgressions. Christ, being madea sin-offering for us, to free us from those bonds, himself submittedto be bound for us. To his bonds we owe our liberty; thus the Son makesus free.
Joh 18:13-27	<br>Simon Peter denied his Master. The particulars have been noticed in theremarks on the other Gospels. The beginning of sin is as the lettingforth of water. The sin of lying is a fruitful sin; one lie needsanother to support it, and that another. If a call to expose ourselvesto danger be clear, we may hope God will enable us to honour him; if itbe not, we may fear that God will leave us to shame ourselves. Theysaid nothing concerning the miracles of Jesus, by which he had done somuch good, and which proved his doctrine. Thus the enemies of Christ,whilst they quarrel with his truth, wilfully shut their eyes againstit. He appeals to those who heard him. The doctrine of Christ maysafely appeal to all that know it, and those who judge in truth bearwitness to it. Our resentment of injuries must never be passionate. Hereasoned with the man that did him the injury, and so may we.
Joh 18:28-32	<br>It was unjust to put one to death who had done so much good, thereforethe Jews were willing to save themselves from reproach. Many fear thescandal of an ill thing, more than the sin of it. Christ had said heshould be delivered to the Gentiles, and they should put him to death;hereby that saying was fulfilled. He had said that he should becrucified, lifted up. If the Jews had judged him by their law, he hadbeen stoned; crucifying never was used among the Jews. It is determinedconcerning us, though not discovered to us, what death we shall die:this should free us from disquiet about that matter. Lord, what, when,and how, thou hast appointed.
Joh 18:33-40	<br>Art thou the King of the Jews? that King of the Jews who has been solong expected? Messiah the Prince; art thou he? Dost thou call thyselfso, and wouldest thou be thought so? Christ answered this question withanother; not for evasion, but that Pilate might consider what he did.He never took upon him any earthly power, never were any traitorousprinciples or practices laid to him. Christ gave an account of thenature of his kingdom. Its nature is not worldly; it is a kingdomwithin men, set up in their hearts and consciences; its richesspiritual, its power spiritual, and it glory within. Its supports arenot worldly; its weapons are spiritual; it needed not, nor used, forceto maintain and advance it, nor opposed any kingdom but that of sin andSatan. Its object and design are not worldly. When Christ said, I amthe Truth, he said, in effect, I am a King. He conquers by theconvincing evidence of truth; he rules by the commanding power oftruth. The subjects of this kingdom are those that are of the truth.Pilate put a good question, he said, What is truth? When we search theScriptures, and attend the ministry of the word, it must be with thisinquiry, What is truth? and with this prayer, Lead me in thy truth;into all truth. But many put this question, who have not patience topreserve in their search after truth; or not humility enough to receiveit. By this solemn declaration of Christ's innocence, it appears, thatthough the Lord Jesus was treated as the worst of evil-doers, he neverdeserved such treatment. But it unfolds the design of his death; thathe died as a Sacrifice for our sins. Pilate was willing to please allsides; and was governed more by worldly wisdom than by the rules ofjustice. Sin is a robber, yet is foolishly chosen by many rather thanChrist, who would truly enrich us. Let us endeavour to make ouraccusers ashamed as Christ did; and let us beware of crucifying Christafresh.
Joh 19:1-18	<br>Little did Pilate think with what holy regard these sufferings ofChrist would, in after-ages, be thought upon and spoken of by the bestand greatest of men. Our Lord Jesus came forth, willing to be exposedto their scorn. It is good for every one with faith, to behold ChristJesus in his sufferings. Behold him, and love him; be still lookingunto Jesus. Did their hatred sharpen their endeavours against him? andshall not our love for him quicken our endeavours for him and hiskingdom? Pilate seems to have thought that Jesus might be some personabove the common order. Even natural conscience makes men afraid ofbeing found fighting against God. As our Lord suffered for the sinsboth of Jews and Gentiles, it was a special part of the counsel ofDivine Wisdom, that the Jews should first purpose his death, and theGentiles carry that purpose into effect. Had not Christ been thusrejected of men, we had been for ever rejected of God. Now was the Sonof man delivered into the hands of wicked and unreasonable men. He wasled forth for us, that we might escape. He was nailed to the cross, asa Sacrifice bound to the altar. The Scripture was fulfilled; he did notdie at the altar among the sacrifices, but among criminals sacrificedto public justice. And now let us pause, and with faith look uponJesus. Was ever sorrow like unto his sorrow? See him bleeding, see himdying, see him and love him! love him, and live to him!
Joh 19:19-30	<br>Here are some remarkable circumstances of Jesus' death, more fullyrelated than before. Pilate would not gratify the chief priests byallowing the writing to be altered; which was doubtless owing to asecret power of God upon his heart, that this statement of our Lord'scharacter and authority might continue. Many things done by the Romansoldiers were fulfilments of the prophecies of the Old Testament. Allthings therein written shall be fulfilled. Christ tenderly provided forhis mother at his death. Sometimes, when God removes one comfort fromus, he raises up another for us, where we looked not for it. Christ'sexample teaches all men to honour their parents in life and death; toprovide for their wants, and to promote their comfort by every means intheir power. Especially observe the dying word wherewith Jesus breathedout his soul. It is finished; that is, the counsels of the Fatherconcerning his sufferings were now fulfilled. It is finished; all thetypes and prophecies of the Old Testament, which pointed at thesufferings of the Messiah, were accomplished. It is finished; theceremonial law is abolished; the substance is now come, and all theshadows are done away. It is finished; an end is made of transgressionby bringing in an everlasting righteousness. His sufferings were nowfinished, both those of his soul, and those of his body. It isfinished; the work of man's redemption and salvation is now completed.His life was not taken from him by force, but freely given up.
Joh 19:31-37	<br>A trial was made whether Jesus was dead. He died in less time thanpersons crucified commonly did. It showed that he had laid down hislife of himself. The spear broke up the very fountains of life; nohuman body could survive such a wound. But its being so solemnlyattested, shows there was something peculiar in it. The blood and waterthat flowed out, signified those two great benefits which all believerspartake of through Christ, justification and sanctification; blood foratonement, water for purification. They both flow from the pierced sideof our Redeemer. To Christ crucified we owe merit for ourjustification, and Spirit and grace for our sanctification. Let thissilence the fears of weak Christians, and encourage their hopes; therecame both water and blood out of Jesus' pierced side, both to justifyand sanctify them. The Scripture was fulfilled, in Pilate's notallowing his legs to be broken, Ps 34:20. There was a type of this inthe paschal lamb, Ex 12:46. May we ever look to Him, whom, by our sins,we have ignorantly and heedlessly pierced, nay, sometimes againstconvictions and mercies; and who shed from his wounded side both waterand blood, that we might be justified and sanctified in his name.
Joh 19:38-42	<br>Joseph of Arimathea was a disciple of Christ in secret. Disciplesshould openly own themselves; yet some, who in lesser trials have beenfearful, in greater have been courageous. When God has work to do, hecan find out such as are proper to do it. The embalming was done byNicodemus, a secret friend to Christ, though not his constant follower.That grace which at first is like a bruised reed, may afterwardresemble a strong cedar. Hereby these two rich men showed the valuethey had for Christ's person and doctrine, and that it was not lessenedby the reproach of the cross. We must do our duty as the present dayand opportunity are, and leave it to God to fulfil his promises in hisown way and his own time. The grave of Jesus was appointed with thewicked, as was the case of those who suffered as criminals; but he waswith the rich in his death, as prophesied, Isa 53:9; these twocircumstances it was very unlikely should ever be united in the sameperson. He was buried in a new sepulchre; therefore it could not besaid that it was not he, but some other that rose. We also are heretaught not to be particular as to the place of our burial. He wasburied in the sepulchre next at hand. Here is the Sun of Righteousnessset for a while, to rise again in greater glory, and then to set nomore.
Joh 20:1-10	<br>If Christ gave his life a ransom, and had not taken it again, it wouldnot have appeared that his giving it was accepted as satisfaction. Itwas a great trial to Mary, that the body was gone. Weak believers oftenmake that the matter of complaint, which is really just ground of hope,and matter of joy. It is well when those more honoured than others withthe privileges of disciples, are more active than others in the duty ofdisciples; more willing to take pains, and run hazards, in a good work.We must do our best, and neither envy those who can do better, nordespise those who do as well as they can, though they come behind. Thedisciple whom Jesus loved in a special manner, and who therefore in aspecial manner loved Jesus, was foremost. The love of Christ will makeus to abound in every duty more than any thing else. He that was behindwas Peter, who had denied Christ. A sense of guilt hinders us in theservice of God. As yet the disciples knew not the Scripture; theyChrist must rise again from the dead.
Joh 20:11-18	<br>We are likely to seek and find, when we seek with affection, and seekin tears. But many believers complain of the clouds and darkness theyare under, which are methods of grace for humbling their souls,mortifying their sins, and endearing Christ to them. A sight of angelsand their smiles, will not suffice, without a sight of Jesus, and God'ssmiles in him. None know, but those who have tasted it, the sorrows ofa deserted soul, which has had comfortable evidences of the love of Godin Christ, and hopes of heaven, but has now lost them, and walks indarkness; such a wounded spirit who can bear? Christ, in manifestinghimself to those that seek him, often outdoes their expectations. Seehow Mary's heart was in earnest to find Jesus. Christ's way of makinghimself known to his people is by his word; his word applied to theirsouls, speaking to them in particular. It might be read, Is it myMaster? See with what pleasure those who love Jesus speak of hisauthority over them. He forbids her to expect that his bodily presencelook further, than the present state of things. Observe the relation toGod, from union with Christ. We, partaking of a Divine nature, Christ'sFather is our Father; and he, partaking of the human nature, our God ishis God. Christ's ascension into heaven, there to plead for us, islikewise an unspeakable comfort. Let them not think this earth is to betheir home and rest; their eye and aim, and earnest desires, must beupon another world, and this ever upon their hearts, I ascend,therefore I must seek the things which are above. And let those whoknow the word of Christ, endeavour that others should get good fromtheir knowledge.
Joh 20:19-25	<br>This was the first day of the week, and this day is afterwards oftenmentioned by the sacred writers; for it was evidently set apart as theChristian sabbath, in remembrance of Christ's resurrection. Thedisciples had shut the doors for fear of the Jews; and when they had nosuch expectation, Jesus himself came and stood in the midst of them,having miraculously, though silently, opened the doors. It is a comfortto Christ's disciples, when their assemblies can only be held inprivate, that no doors can shut out Christ's presence. When Hemanifests his love to believers by the comforts of his Spirit, heassures them that because he lives, they shall live also. A sight ofChrist will gladden the heart of a disciple at any time; and the morewe see of Jesus, the more we shall rejoice. He said, Receive ye theHoly Ghost, thus showing that their spiritual life, as well as alltheir ability for their work, would be derived from him, and dependedupon him. Every word of Christ which is received in the heart by faith,comes accompanied by this Divine breathing; and without this there isneither light nor life. Nothing is seen, known, discerned, or felt ofGod, but through this. After this, Christ directed the apostles todeclare the only method by which sin would be forgiven. This power didnot exist at all in the apostles as a power to give judgment, but onlyas a power to declare the character of those whom God would accept orreject in the day of judgment. They have clearly laid down the markswhereby a child of God may be discerned and be distinguished from afalse professor; and according to what they have declared shall everycase be decided in the day of judgment. When we assemble in Christ'sname, especially on his holy day, he will meet with us, and speak peaceto us. The disciples of Christ should endeavour to build up one anotherin their most holy faith, both by repeating what they have heard tothose that were absent, and by making known what they have experienced.Thomas limited the Holy One of Israel, when he would be convinced byhis own method or not at all. He might justly have been left in hisunbelief, after rejecting such abundant proofs. The fears and sorrowsof the disciples are often lengthened, to punish their negligence.
Joh 20:26-29	<br>That one day in seven should be religiously observed, was anappointment from the beginning. And that, in the kingdom of theMessiah, the first day of the week should be that solemn day, waspointed out, in that Christ on that day once and again met hisdisciples in a religious assembly. The religious observance of that dayhas come down to us through every age of the church. There is not anunbelieving word in our tongues, nor thought in our minds, but it isknown to the Lord Jesus; and he was pleased to accommodate himself evento Thomas, rather than leave him in his unbelief. We ought thus to bearwith the weak, Ro 15:1,2. This warning is given to all. If we arefaithless, we are Christless and graceless, hopeless and joyless.Thomas was ashamed of his unbelief, and cried out, My Lord and my God.He spoke with affection, as one that took hold of Christ with all hismight; "My Lord and my God." Sound and sincere believers, though slowand weak, shall be graciously accepted of the Lord Jesus. It is theduty of those who read and hear the gospel, to believe, to embrace thedoctrine of Christ, and that record concerning him, 1Jo 5:11.
Joh 20:30,31	<br>There were other signs and proofs of our Lord's resurrection, but thesewere committed to writing, that all might believe that Jesus was thepromised Messiah, the Saviour of sinners, and the Son of God; that, bythis faith, they might obtain eternal life, by his mercy, truth, andpower. May we believe that Jesus is the Christ, and believing may wehave life through his name.
Joh 21:1-14	<br>Christ makes himself known to his people, usually in his ordinances;but sometimes by his Spirit he visits them when employed in theirbusiness. It is good for the disciples of Christ to be together incommon conversation, and common business. The hour for their enteringupon action was not come. They would help to maintain themselves, andnot be burdensome to any. Christ's time of making himself known to hispeople, is when they are most at a loss. He knows the temporal wants ofhis people, and has promised them not only grace sufficient, but foodconvenient. Divine Providence extends itself to things most minute, andthose are happy who acknowledge God in all their ways. Those who arehumble, diligent, and patient, though their labours may be crossed,shall be crowned; they sometimes live to see their affairs take a happyturn, after many struggles. And there is nothing lost by observingChrist's orders; it is casting the net on the right side of the ship.Jesus manifests himself to his people by doing that for them which noneelse can do, and things which they looked not for. He would take carethat those who left all for him, should not want any good thing. Andlatter favours are to bring to mind former favours, that eaten breadmay not be forgotten. He whom Jesus loved was the first that said, Itis the Lord. John had cleaved most closely to his Master in hissufferings, and knew him soonest. Peter was the most zealous, andreached Christ the first. How variously God dispenses his gifts, andwhat difference there may be between some believers and others in theway of their honouring Christ, yet they all may be accepted of him!Others continue in the ship, drag the net, and bring the fish to shore,and such persons ought not to be blamed as worldly; for they, in theirplaces, are as truly serving Christ as the others. The Lord Jesus hadprovision ready for them. We need not be curious in inquiring whencethis came; but we may be comforted at Christ's care for his disciples.Although there were so many, and such great fishes, yet they lost none,nor damaged their net. The net of the gospel has enclosed multitudes,yet it is as strong as ever to bring souls to God.
Joh 21:15-19	<br>Our Lord addressed Peter by his original name, as if he had forfeitedthat of Peter through his denying him. He now answered, Thou knowestthat I love thee; but without professing to love Jesus more thanothers. We must not be surprised to have our sincerity called intoquestion, when we ourselves have done that which makes it doubtful.Every remembrance of past sins, even pardoned sins, renews the sorrowof a true penitent. Conscious of integrity, Peter solemnly appealed toChrist, as knowing all things, even the secrets of his heart. It iswell when our falls and mistakes make us more humble and watchful. Thesincerity of our love to God must be brought to the test; and itbehoves us to inquire with earnest, preserving prayer to theheart-searching God, to examine and prove us, whether we are able tostand this test. No one can be qualified to feed the sheep and lambs ofChrist, who does not love the good Shepherd more than any earthlyadvantage or object. It is the great concern of every good man,whatever death he dies, to glorify God in it; for what is our chief endbut this, to die to the Lord, at the word of the Lord?
Joh 21:20-24	<br>Sufferings, pains, and death, will appear formidable even to theexperienced Christian; but in the hope to glorify God, to leave asinful world, and to be present with his Lord, he becomes ready to obeythe Redeemer's call, and to follow Him through death to glory. It isthe will of Christ that his disciples should mind their own duty, andnot be curious about future events, either as to themselves or others.Many things we are apt to be anxious about, which are nothing to us.Other people's affairs are nothing to us, to intermeddle in; we mustquietly work, and mind our own business. Many curious questions are putabout the counsels of God, and the state of the unseen world, as towhich we may say, What is this to us? And if we attend to the duty offollowing Christ, we shall find neither heart nor time to meddle withthat which does not belong to us. How little are any unwrittentraditions to be relied upon! Let the Scripture be its own interpreter,and explain itself; as it is, in a great measure, its own evidence, andproves itself, for it is light. See the easy setting right suchmistakes by the word of Christ. Scripture language is the safestchannel for Scripture truth; the words which the Holy Ghost teaches,1Co 2:13. Those who cannot agree in the same terms of art, and theapplication of them, may yet agree in the same Scripture terms, and tolove one another.<br>Verse 25<br>Only a small part of the actions of Jesus had been written. But let usbless God for all that is in the Scriptures, and be thankful that thereis so much in so small a space. Enough is recorded to direct our faith,and regulate our practice; more would have been unnecessary. Much ofwhat is written is overlooked, much forgotten, and much made the matterof doubtful disputes. We may, however, look forward to the joy we shallreceive in heaven, from a more complete knowledge of all Jesus did andsaid, as well as of the conduct of his providence and grace in hisdealings with each of us. May this be our happiness. These are writtenthat ye might believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God; andthat believing ye might have life through his name, ch. 20:31.
Act 1:1-5	<br>Our Lord told the disciples the work they were to do. The apostles mettogether at Jerusalem; Christ having ordered them not to depart thence,but to wait for the pouring out of the Holy Spirit. This would be abaptism by the Holy Ghost, giving them power to work miracles, andenlightening and sanctifying their souls. This confirms the Divinepromise, and encourages us to depend upon it, that we have heard itfrom Christ; for in Him all the promises of God are yea and amen.
Act 1:6-11	<br>They were earnest in asking about that which their Master never haddirected or encouraged them to seek. Our Lord knew that his ascensionand the teaching of the Holy Spirit would soon end these expectations,and therefore only gave them a rebuke; but it is a caution to hischurch in all ages, to take heed of a desire of forbidden knowledge. Hehad given his disciples instructions for the discharge of their duty,both before his death and since his resurrection, and this knowledge isenough for a Christian. It is enough that He has engaged to givebelievers strength equal to their trials and services; that under theinfluence of the Holy Spirit they may, in one way or other, bewitnesses for Christ on earth, while in heaven he manages theirconcerns with perfect wisdom, truth, and love. When we stand gazing andtrifling, the thoughts of our Master's second coming should quicken andawaken us: when we stand gazing and trembling, they should comfort andencourage us. May our expectation of it be stedfast and joyful, givingdiligence to be found of him blameless.
Act 1:12-14	<br>God can find hiding-places for his people. They made supplication. AllGod's people are praying people. It was now a time of trouble anddanger with the disciples of Christ; but if any is afflicted, let himpray; that will silence cares and fears. They had now a great work todo, and before they entered upon it, they were earnest in prayer to Godfor his presence. They were waiting for the descent of the Spirit, andabounded in prayer. Those are in the best frame to receive spiritualblessings, who are in a praying frame. Christ had promised shortly tosend the Holy Ghost; that promise was not to do away prayer, but toquicken and encourage it. A little company united in love, exemplary intheir conduct, fervent in prayer, and wisely zealous to promote thecause of Christ, are likely to increase rapidly.
Act 1:15-26	<br>The great thing the apostles were to attest to the world, was, Christ'sresurrection; for that was the great proof of his being the Messiah,and the foundation of our hope in him. The apostles were ordained, notto wordly dignity and dominion, but to preach Christ, and the power ofhis resurrection. An appeal was made to God; "Thou, Lord, who knowestthe hearts of all men," which we do not; and better than they knowtheir own. It is fit that God should choose his own servants; and sofar as he, by the disposals of his providence, or the gifts of hisSpirit, shows whom he was chosen, or what he has chosen for us, weought to fall in with his will. Let us own his hand in the determiningeverything which befalls us, especially in those by which any trust maybe committed to us.
Act 2:1-4	<br>We cannot forget how often, while their Master was with them there werestrifes among the disciples which should be the greatest; but now allthese strifes were at an end. They had prayed more together of late.Would we have the Spirit poured out upon us from on high, let us be allof one accord. And notwithstanding differences of sentiments andinterests, as there were among those disciples, let us agree to loveone another; for where brethren dwell together in unity, there the Lordcommands his blessing. A rushing mighty wind came with great force.This was to signify the powerful influences and working of the Spiritof God upon the minds of men, and thereby upon the world. Thus theconvictions of the Spirit make way for his comforts; and the roughblasts of that blessed wind, prepare the soul for its soft and gentlegales. There was an appearance of something like flaming fire, lightingon every one of them, according to John Baptist's saying concerningChrist; He shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost, and with fire. TheSpirit, like fire, melts the heart, burns up the dross, and kindlespious and devout affections in the soul; in which, as in the fire onthe altar, the spiritual sacrifices are offered up. They were allfilled with the Holy Ghost, more than before. They were filled with thegraces of the Spirit, and more than ever under his sanctifyinginfluences; more weaned from this world, and better acquainted with theother. They were more filled with the comforts of the Spirit, rejoicedmore than ever in the love of Christ and the hope of heaven: in it alltheir griefs and fears were swallowed up. They were filled with thegifts of the Holy Ghost; they had miraculous powers for the furtheranceof the gospel. They spake, not from previous though or meditation, butas the Spirit gave them utterance.
Act 2:5-13	<br>The difference in languages which arose at Babel, has much hindered thespread of knowledge and religion. The instruments whom the Lord firstemployed in spreading the Christian religion, could have made noprogress without this gift, which proved that their authority was fromGod.
Act 2:14-21	<br>Peter's sermon shows that he was thoroughly recovered from his fall,and thoroughly restored to the Divine favour; for he who had deniedChrist, now boldly confessed him. His account of the miraculous pouringforth of the Spirit, was designed to awaken the hearers to embrace thefaith of Christ, and to join themselves to his church. It was thefulfilling the Scripture, and the fruit of Christ's resurrection andascension, and proof of both. Though Peter was filled with the HolyGhost, and spake with tongues as the Spirit gave him utterance, yet hedid not think to set aside the Scriptures. Christ's scholars neverlearn above their Bible; and the Spirit is given, not to do away theScriptures, but to enable us to understand, approve, and obey them.Assuredly none will escape the condemnation of the great day, exceptthose who call upon the name of the Lord, in and through his Son JesusChrist, as the Saviour of sinners, and the Judge of all mankind.
Act 2:22-36	<br>From this gift of the Holy Ghost, Peter preaches unto them Jesus: andhere is the history of Christ. Here is an account of his death andsufferings, which they witnessed but a few weeks before. His death isconsidered as God's act; and of wonderful grace and wisdom. Thus Divinejustice must be satisfied, God and man brought together again, andChrist himself glorified, according to an eternal counsel, which couldnot be altered. And as the people's act; in them it was an act of awfulsin and folly. Christ's resurrection did away the reproach of hisdeath; Peter speaks largely upon this. Christ was God's Holy One,sanctified and set apart to his service in the work of redemption. Hisdeath and sufferings should be, not to him only, but to all his, theentrance to a blessed life for evermore. This event had taken place asforetold, and the apostles were witnesses. Nor did the resurrectionrest upon this alone; Christ had poured upon his disciples themiraculous gifts and Divine influences, of which they witnessed theeffects. Through the Saviour, the ways of life are made known; and weare encouraged to expect God's presence, and his favour for evermore.All this springs from assured belief that Jesus is the Lord, and theanointed Saviour.
Act 2:37-41	<br>From the first delivery of that Divine message, it appeared that therewas Divine power going with it; and thousands were brought to theobedience of faith. But neither Peter's words, nor the miracle theywitnessed, could have produced such effects, had not the Holy Spiritbeen given. Sinners, when their eyes are opened, cannot but be prickedto the heart for sin, cannot but feel an inward uneasiness. The apostleexhorted them to repent of their sins, and openly to avow their beliefin Jesus as the Messiah, by being baptized in his name. Thus professingtheir faith in Him, they would receive remission of their sins, andpartake of the gifts and graces of the Holy Spirit. To separate fromwicked people, is the only way to save ourselves from them. Those whorepent of their sins, and give up themselves to Jesus Christ, mustprove their sincerity by breaking off from the wicked. We must saveourselves from them; which denotes avoiding them with dread and holyfear. By God's grace three thousand persons accepted the gospelinvitation. There can be no doubt that the gift of the Holy Ghost,which they all received, and from which no true believer has ever beenshut out, was that Spirit of adoption, that converting, guiding,sanctifying grace, which is bestowed upon all the members of the familyof our heavenly Father. Repentance and remission of sins are stillpreached to the chief of sinners, in the Redeemer's name; still theHoly Spirit seals the blessing on the believer's heart; still theencouraging promises are to us and our children; and still theblessings are offered to all that are afar off.
Act 2:42-47	<br>In these verses we have the history of the truly primitive church, ofthe first days of it; its state of infancy indeed, but, like that, thestate of its greatest innocence. They kept close to holy ordinances,and abounded in piety and devotion; for Christianity, when admitted inthe power of it, will dispose the soul to communion with God in allthose ways wherein he has appointed us to meet him, and has promised tomeet us. The greatness of the event raised them above the world, andthe Holy Ghost filled them with such love, as made every one to be toanother as to himself, and so made all things common, not by destroyingproperty, but doing away selfishness, and causing charity. And God whomoved them to it, knew that they were quickly to be driven from theirpossessions in Judea. The Lord, from day to day, inclined the hearts ofmore to embrace the gospel; not merely professors, but such as wereactually brought into a state of acceptance with God, being madepartakers of regenerating grace. Those whom God has designed foreternal salvation, shall be effectually brought to Christ, till theearth is filled with the knowledge of his glory.
Act 3:1-11	<br>The apostles and the first believers attended the temple worship at thehours of prayer. Peter and John seem to have been led by a Divinedirection, to work a miracle on a man above forty years old, who hadbeen a cripple from his birth. Peter, in the name of Jesus of Nazareth,bade him rise up and walk. Thus, if we would attempt to good purposethe healing of men's souls, we must go forth in the name and power ofJesus Christ, calling on helpless sinners to arise and walk in the wayof holiness, by faith in Him. How sweet the thought to our souls, thatin respect to all the crippled faculties of our fallen nature, the nameof Jesus Christ of Nazareth can make us whole! With what holy joy andrapture shall we tread the holy courts, when God the Spirit causes usto enter therein by his strength!
Act 3:12-18	<br>Observe the difference in the manner of working the miracles. Our Lordalways spoke as having Almighty power, never hesitated to receive thegreatest honour that was given to him on account of his Divinemiracles. But the apostles referred all to their Lord, and refused toreceive any honour, except as his undeserving instruments. This showsthat Jesus was one with the Father, and co-equal with Him; while theapostles knew that they were weak, sinful men, and dependent for everything on Jesus, whose power effected the cure. Useful men must be veryhumble. Not unto us, O Lord, not unto us, but to thy name, give glory.Every crown must be cast at the feet of Christ. The apostle showed theJews the greatness of their crime, but would not anger or drive them todespair. Assuredly, those who reject, refuse, or deny Christ, do itthrough ignorance; but this can in no case be an excuse.
Act 3:19-21	<br>The absolute necessity of repentance is to be solemnly charged upon theconsciences of all who desire that their sins may be blotted out, andthat they may share in the refreshment which nothing but a sense ofChrist's pardoning love can afford. Blessed are those who have feltthis. It was not needful for the Holy Spirit to make known the timesand seasons of these dispensations. These subjects are still leftobscure. But when sinners are convinced of their sins, they will cry tothe Lord for pardon; and to the penitent, converted, and believing,times of refreshment will come from the presence of the Lord. In astate of trial and probation, the glorified Redeemer will be out ofsight, because we must live by faith in him.
Act 3:22-26	<br>Here is a powerful address to warn the Jews of the dreadfulconsequences of their unbelief, in the very words of Moses, theirfavourite prophet, out of pretended zeal for whom they were ready toreject Christianity, and to try to destroy it. Christ came into theworld to bring a blessing with him. And he sent his Spirit to be thegreat blessing. Christ came to bless us, by turning us from ouriniquities, and saving us from our sins. We, by nature cleave to sin;the design of Divine grace is to turn us from it, that we may not onlyforsake, but hate it. Let none think that they can be happy bycontinuing in sin, when God declares that the blessing is in beingturned from all iniquity. Let none think that they understand orbelieve the gospel, who only seek deliverance from the punishment ofsin, but do not expect happiness in being delivered from sin itself.And let none expect to be turned from their sin, except by believingin, and receiving Christ the Son of God, as their wisdom,righteousness, sanctification, and redemption.
Act 4:1-4	<br>The apostles preached through Jesus the resurrection from the dead. Itincludes all the happiness of the future state; this they preachedthrough Jesus Christ, to be had through him only. Miserable is theircase, to whom the glory of Christ's kingdom is a grief; for since theglory of that kingdom is everlasting, their grief will be everlastingalso. The harmless and useful servants of Christ, like the apostles,have often been troubled for their work of faith and labour of love,when wicked men have escaped. And to this day instances are notwanting, in which reading the Scriptures, social prayer, and religiousconversation meet with frowns and checks. But if we obey the preceptsof Christ, he will support us.
Act 4:5-14	<br>Peter being filled with the Holy Ghost, would have all to understand,that the miracle had been wrought by the name, or power, of Jesus ofNazareth, the Messiah, whom they had crucified; and this confirmedtheir testimony to his resurrection from the dead, which proved him tobe the Messiah. These rulers must either be saved by that Jesus whomthey had crucified, or they must perish for ever. The name of Jesus isgiven to men of every age and nation, as that whereby alone believersare saved from the wrath to come. But when covetousness, pride, or anycorrupt passion, rules within, men shut their eyes, and close theirhearts, in enmity against the light; considering all as ignorant andunlearned, who desire to know nothing in comparison with Christcrucified. And the followers of Christ should act so that all whoconverse with them, may take knowledge that they have been with Jesus.That makes them holy, heavenly, spiritual, and cheerful, and raisesthem above this world.
Act 4:15-22	<br>All the care of the rulers is, that the doctrine of Christ spread notamong the people, yet they cannot say it is false or dangerous, or ofany ill tendency; and they are ashamed to own the true reason; that ittestifies against their hypocrisy, wickedness, and tyranny. Those whoknow how to put a just value upon Christ's promises, know how to putjust contempt upon the world's threatenings. The apostles look withconcern on perishing souls, and know they cannot escape eternal ruinbut by Jesus Christ, therefore they are faithful in warning, andshowing the right way. None will enjoy peace of mind, nor actuprightly, till they have learned to guide their conduct by the fixedstandard of truth, and not by the shifting opinions and fancies of men.Especially beware of a vain attempt to serve two masters, God and theworld; the end will be, you can serve neither fully.
Act 4:23-31	<br>Christ's followers do best in company, provided it is their owncompany. It encourages God's servants, both in doing work, andsuffering work, that they serve the God who made all things, andtherefore has the disposal of all events; and the Scriptures must befulfilled. Jesus was anointed to be a Saviour, therefore it wasdetermined he should be a sacrifice, to make atonement for sin. But sinis not the less evil for God's bringing good out of it. In threateningtimes, our care should not be so much that troubles may be prevented,as that we may go on with cheerfulness and courage in our work andduty. They do not pray, Lord let us go away from our work, now that itis become dangerous, but, Lord, give us thy grace to go on stedfastlyin our work, and not to fear the face of man. Those who desire Divineaid and encouragement, may depend upon having them, and they ought togo forth, and go on, in the strength of the Lord God. God gave a signof acceptance of their prayers. The place was shaken, that their faithmight be established and unshaken. God gave them greater degrees of hisSpirit; and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, more than ever;by which they were not only encouraged, but enabled to speak the wordof God with boldness. When they find the Lord God help them by hisSpirit, they know they shall not be confounded, Isa 17.
Act 4:32-37	<br>The disciples loved one another. This was the blessed fruit of Christ'sdying precept to his disciples, and his dying prayer for them. Thus itwas then, and it will be so again, when the Spirit shall be poured uponus from on high. The doctrine preached was the resurrection of Christ;a matter of fact, which being duly explained, was a summary of all theduties, privileges, and comforts of Christians. There were evidentfruits of Christ's grace in all they said and did. They were dead tothis world. This was a great evidence of the grace of God in them. Theydid not take away others' property, but they were indifferent to it.They did not call it their own; because they had, in affection,forsaken all for Christ, and were expecting to be stripped of all forcleaving to him. No marvel that they were of one heart and soul, whenthey sat so loose to the wealth of this world. In effect, they had allthings common; for there was not any among them who lacked, care wastaken for their supply. The money was laid at the apostles' feet. Greatcare ought to be taken in the distribution of public charity, that itbe given to such as have need, such as are not able to procure amaintenance for themselves; those who are reduced to want forwell-doing, and for the testimony of a good conscience, ought to beprovided for. Here is one in particular mentioned, remarkable for thisgenerous charity; it was Barnabas. As one designed to be a preacher ofthe gospel, he disentangled himself from the affairs of this life. Whensuch dispositions prevail, and are exercised according to thecircumstances of the times, the testimony will have very great powerupon others.
Act 5:1-11	<br>The sin of Ananias and Sapphira was, that they were ambitious of beingthought eminent disciples, when they were not true disciples.Hypocrites may deny themselves, may forego their worldly advantage inone instance, with a prospect of finding their account in somethingelse. They were covetous of the wealth of the world, and distrustful ofGod and his providence. They thought they might serve both God andmammon. They thought to deceive the apostles. The Spirit of God inPeter discerned the principle of unbelief reigning in the heart ofAnanias. But whatever Satan might suggest, he could not have filled theheart of Ananias with this wickedness had he not been consenting. Thefalsehood was an attempt to deceive the Spirit of truth, who somanifestly spoke and acted by the apostles. The crime of Ananias wasnot his retaining part of the price of the land; he might have kept itall, had he pleased; but his endeavouring to impose upon the apostleswith an awful lie, from a desire to make a vain show, joined withcovetousness. But if we think to put a cheat upon God, we shall put afatal cheat upon our own souls. How sad to see those relations whoshould quicken one another to that which is good, hardening one anotherin that which is evil! And this punishment was in reality mercy to vastnumbers. It would cause strict self-examination, prayer, and dread ofhypocrisy, covetousness, and vain-glory, and it should still do so. Itwould prevent the increase of false professors. Let us learn hence howhateful falsehood is to the God of truth, and not only shun a directlie, but all advantages from the use of doubtful expressions, anddouble meaning in our speech.
Act 5:12-16	<br>The separation of hypocrites by distinguishing judgments, should makethe sincere cleave closer to each other and to the gospel ministry.Whatever tends to the purity and reputation of the church, promotes itsenlargement; but that power alone which wrought such miracles by theapostles, can rescue sinners from the power of sin and Satan, and addbelievers to His worshippers. Christ will work by all his faithfulservants; and every one who applies to him shall be healed.
Act 5:17-25	<br>There is no prison so dark, so strong, but God can visit his people init, and, if he pleases, fetch them out. Recoveries from sickness,releases out of trouble, are granted, not that we may enjoy thecomforts of life, but that God may be honoured with the services of ourlife. It is not for the preachers of Christ's gospel to retire intocorners, as long as they can have any opportunity of preaching in thegreat congregation. They must preach to the lowest, whose souls are asprecious to Christ as the souls of the greatest. Speak to all, for allare concerned. Speak as those who resolve to stand to it, to live anddie by it. Speak all the words of this heavenly, divine life, incomparison with which the present earthly life does not deserve thename. These words of life, which the Holy Ghost puts into your mouth.The words of the gospel are the words of life; words whereby we may besaved. How wretched are those who are vexed at the success of thegospel! They cannot but see that the word and power of the Lord areagainst them; and they tremble for the consequences, yet they will goon.
Act 5:26-33	<br>Many will do an evil thing with daring, yet cannot bear to hear of itafterward, or to have it charged upon them. We cannot expect to beredeemed and healed by Christ, unless we give up ourselves to be ruledby him. Faith takes the Saviour in all his offices, who came, not tosave us in our sins, but to save us from our sins. Had Christ beenexalted to give dominion to Israel, the chief priests would havewelcomed him. But repentance and remission of sins are blessings theyneither valued nor saw their need of; therefore they, by no means,admitted his doctrine. Wherever repentance is wrought, remission isgranted without fail. None are freed from the guilt and punishment ofsin, but those who are freed from the power and dominion of sin; whoare turned from it, and turned against it. Christ gives repentance, byhis Spirit working with the word, to awaken the conscience, to worksorrow for sin, and an effectual change in the heart and life. Thegiving of the Holy Ghost, is plain evidence that it is the will of Godthat Christ should be obeyed. And He will surely destroy those who willnot have Him to reign over them.
Act 5:34-42	<br>The Lord still has all hearts in his hands, and sometimes directs theprudence of the worldly wise, so as to restrain the persecutors. Commonsense tells us to be cautious, while experience and observation showthat the success of frauds in matters of religion has been very short.Reproach for Christ is true preferment, as it makes us conformable tohis pattern, and serviceable to his interest. They rejoiced in it. Ifwe suffer ill for doing well, provided we suffer it well, and as weshould, we ought to rejoice in that grace which enabled us so to do.The apostles did not preach themselves, but Christ. This was thepreaching that most offended the priests. But it ought to be theconstant business of gospel ministers to preach Christ: Christ, and himcrucified; Christ, and him glorified; nothing beside this, but what hasreference to it. And whatever is our station or rank in life, we shouldseek to make Him known, and to glorify his name.
Act 6:1-7	<br>Hitherto the disciples had been of one accord; this often had beennoticed to their honour; but now they were multiplied, they began tomurmur. The word of God was enough to take up all the thoughts, cares,and time of the apostles. The persons chosen to serve tables must beduly qualified. They must be filled with gifts and graces of the HolyGhost, necessary to rightly managing this trust; men of truth, andhating covetousness. All who are employed in the service of the church,ought to be commended to the Divine grace by the prayers of the church.They blessed them in the name of the Lord. The word and grace of Godare greatly magnified, when those are wrought upon by it, who wereleast likely.
Act 6:8-15	<br>When they could not answer Stephen's arguments as a disputant, theyprosecuted him as a criminal, and brought false witnesses against him.And it is next to a miracle of providence, that no greater number ofreligious persons have been murdered in the world, by the way ofperjury and pretence of law, when so many thousands hate them, who makeno conscience of false oaths. Wisdom and holiness make a man's face toshine, yet will not secure men from being treated badly. What shall wesay of man, a rational being, yet attempting to uphold a religioussystem by false witness and murder! And this has been done innumberless instances. But the blame rests not so much upon theunderstanding, as upon the heart of a fallen creature, which isdeceitful above all things and desperately wicked. Yet the servant ofthe Lord, possessing a clear conscience, cheerful hope, and Divineconsolations, may smile in the midst of danger and death.
Act 7:1-16	<br>Stephen was charged as a blasphemer of God, and an apostate from thechurch; therefore he shows that he is a son of Abraham, and valueshimself on it. The slow steps by which the promise made to Abrahamadvanced toward performance, plainly show that it had a spiritualmeaning, and that the land intended was the heavenly. God owned Josephin his troubles, and was with him by the power of his Spirit, both onhis own mind by giving him comfort, and on those he was concerned with,by giving him favour in their eyes. Stephen reminds the Jews of theirmean beginning as a check to priding themselves in the glories of thatnation. Likewise of the wickedness of the patriarchs of their tribes,in envying their brother Joseph; and the same spirit was still workingin them toward Christ and his ministers. The faith of the patriarchs,in desiring to be buried in the land of Canaan, plainly showed they hadregard to the heavenly country. It is well to recur to the first riseof usages, or sentiments, which have been perverted. Would we know thenature and effects of justifying faith, we should study the characterof the father of the faithful. His calling shows the power and freenessof Divine grace, and the nature of conversion. Here also we see thatoutward forms and distinctions are as nothing, compared with separationfrom the world, and devotedness to God.
Act 7:17-29	<br>Let us not be discouraged at the slowness of the fulfilling of God'spromises. Suffering times often are growing times with the church. Godis preparing for his people's deliverance, when their day is darkest,and their distress deepest. Moses was exceeding fair, "fair towardGod;" it is the beauty of holiness which is in God's sight of greatprice. He was wonderfully preserved in his infancy; for God will takespecial care of those of whom he designs to make special use. And didhe thus protect the child Moses? Much more will he secure the interestsof his holy child Jesus, from the enemies who are gathered togetheragainst him. They persecuted Stephen for disputing in defence of Christand his gospel: in opposition to these they set up Moses and his law.They may understand, if they do not wilfully shut their eyes againstthe light, that God will, by this Jesus, deliver them out of a worseslavery than that of Egypt. Although men prolong their own miseries,yet the Lord will take care of his servants, and effect his own designsof mercy.
Act 7:30-41	<br>Men deceive themselves, if they think God cannot do what he sees to begood any where; he can bring his people into a wilderness, and therespeak comfortably to them. He appeared to Moses in a flame of fire, yetthe bush was not consumed; which represented the state of Israel inEgypt, where, though they were in the fire of affliction, yet they werenot consumed. It may also be looked upon as a type of Christ's takingupon him the nature of man, and the union between the Divine and humannature. The death of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, cannot break thecovenant relation between God and them. Our Saviour by this proves thefuture state, Mt 22:31. Abraham is dead, yet God is still his God,therefore Abraham is still alive. Now, this is that life andimmortality which are brought to light by the gospel. Stephen hereshows that Moses was an eminent type of Christ, as he was Israel'sdeliverer. God has compassion for the troubles of his church, and thegroans of his persecuted people; and their deliverance takes rise fromhis pity. And that deliverance was typical of what Christ did, when,for us men, and for our salvation, he came down from heaven. ThisJesus, whom they now refused, as their fathers did Moses, even thissame has God advanced to be a Prince and Saviour. It does not at alltake from the just honour of Moses to say, that he was but aninstrument, and that he is infinitely outshone by Jesus. In assertingthat Jesus should change the customs of the ceremonial law. Stephen wasso far from blaspheming Moses, that really he honoured him, by showinghow the prophecy of Moses was come to pass, which was so clear. God whogave them those customs by his servant Moses, might, no doubt, changethe custom by his Son Jesus. But Israel thrust Moses from them, andwould have returned to their bondage; so men in general will not obeyJesus, because they love this present evil world, and rejoice in theirown works and devices.
Act 7:42-50	<br>Stephen upbraids the Jews with the idolatry of their fathers, to whichGod gave them up as a punishment for their early forsaking him. It wasno dishonour, but an honour to God, that the tabernacle gave way to thetemple; so it is now, that the earthly temple gives way to thespiritual one; and so it will be when, at last, the spiritual shallgive way to the eternal one. The whole world is God's temple, in whichhe is every where present, and fills it with his glory; what occasionhas he then for a temple to manifest himself in? And these things showhis eternal power and Godhead. But as heaven is his throne, and theearth his footstool, so none of our services can profit Him who madeall things. Next to the human nature of Christ, the broken andspiritual heart is his most valued temple.
Act 7:51-53	<br>Stephen was going on, it seems, to show that the temple and the templeservice must come to an end, and it would be the glory of both to giveway to the worship of the Father in spirit and in truth; but heperceived they would not bear it. Therefore he broke off, and by theSpirit of wisdom, courage, and power, sharply rebuked his persecutors.When plain arguments and truths provoke the opposers of the gospel,they should be shown their guilt and danger. They, like their fathers,were stubborn and wilful. There is that in our sinful hearts, whichalways resists the Holy Ghost, a flesh that lusts against the Spirit,and wars against his motions; but in the hearts of God's elect, whenthe fulness of time comes, this resistance is overcome. The gospel wasoffered now, not by angels, but from the Holy Ghost; yet they did notembrace it, for they were resolved not to comply with God, either inhis law or in his gospel. Their guilt stung them to the heart, and theysought relief in murdering their reprover, instead of sorrow andsupplication for mercy.
Act 7:54-60	<br>Nothing is so comfortable to dying saints, or so encouraging tosuffering saints, as to see Jesus at the right hand of God: blessed beGod, by faith we may see him there. Stephen offered up two shortprayers in his dying moments. Our Lord Jesus is God, to whom we are toseek, and in whom we are to trust and comfort ourselves, living anddying. And if this has been our care while we live, it will be ourcomfort when we die. Here is a prayer for his persecutors. Though thesin was very great, yet if they would lay it to their hearts, God wouldnot lay it to their charge. Stephen died as much in a hurry as ever anyman did, yet, when he died, the words used are, he fell asleep; heapplied himself to his dying work with as much composure as if he hadbeen going to sleep. He shall awake again in the morning of theresurrection, to be received into the presence of the Lord, where isfulness of joy, and to share the pleasures that are at his right hand,for evermore.
Act 8:1-4	<br>Though persecution must not drive us from our work, yet it may send usto work elsewhere. Wherever the established believer is driven, hecarries the knowledge of the gospel, and makes known the preciousnessof Christ in every place. Where a simple desire of doing goodinfluences the heart, it will be found impossible to shut a man outfrom all opportunities of usefulness.
Act 8:5-13	<br>As far as the gospel prevails, evil spirits are dislodged, particularlyunclean spirits. All inclinations to the lusts of the flesh which waragainst the soul are such. Distempers are here named, the mostdifficult to be cured by the course of nature, and most expressive ofthe disease of sin. Pride, ambition, and desire after grandeur havealways caused abundance of mischief, both to the world and to thechurch. The people said of Simon, This man is the great power of God.See how ignorant and thoughtless people mistake. But how strong is thepower of Divine grace, by which they were brought to Christ, who isTruth itself! The people not only gave heed to what Philip said, butwere fully convinced that it was of God, and not of men, and gave upthemselves to be directed thereby. Even bad men, and those whose heartsstill go after covetousness, may come before God as his people come,and for a time continue with them. And many wonder at the proofs ofDivine truths, who never experience their power. The gospel preachedmay have a common operation upon a soul, where it never produced inwardholiness. All are not savingly converted who profess to believe thegospel.
Act 8:14-25	<br>The Holy Ghost was as yet fallen upon none of these coverts, in theextraordinary powers conveyed by the descent of the Spirit upon the dayof Pentecost. We may take encouragement from this example, in prayingto God to give the renewing graces of the Holy Ghost to all for whosespiritual welfare we are concerned; for that includes all blessings. Noman can give the Holy Spirit by the laying on of his hands; but weshould use our best endeavours to instruct those for whom we pray.Simon Magus was ambitious to have the honour of an apostle, but carednot at all to have the spirit and disposition of a Christian. He wasmore desirous to gain honour to himself, than to do good to others.Peter shows him his crime. He esteemed the wealth of this world, as ifit would answer for things relating to the other life, and wouldpurchase the pardon of sin, the gift of the Holy Ghost, and eternallife. This was such a condemning error as could by no means consistwith a state of grace. Our hearts are what they are in the sight ofGod, who cannot be deceived. And if they are not right in his sight,our religion is vain, and will stand us in no stead. A proud andcovetous heart cannot be right with God. It is possible for a man tocontinue under the power of sin, yet to put on a form of godliness.When tempted with money to do evil, see what a perishing thing moneyis, and scorn it. Think not that Christianity is a trade to live by inthis world. There is much wickedness in the thought of the heart, itsfalse notions, and corrupt affections, and wicked projects, which mustbe repented of, or we are undone. But it shall be forgiven, upon ourrepentance. The doubt here is of the sincerity of Simon's repentance,not of his pardon, if his repentance was sincere. Grant us, Lord,another sort of faith than that which made Simon wonder only, and didnot sanctify his heart. May we abhor all thoughts of making religionserve the purposes of pride or ambition. And keep us from that subtlepoison of spiritual pride, which seeks glory to itself even fromhumility. May we seek only the honour which cometh from God.
Act 8:26-40	<br>Philip was directed to go to a desert. Sometimes God opens a door ofopportunity to his ministers in very unlikely places. We should studyto do good to those we come into company with by travelling. We shouldnot be so shy of all strangers as some affect to be. As to those ofwhom we know nothing else, we know this, that they have souls. It iswisdom for men of business to redeem time for holy duties; to fill upevery minute with something which will turn to a good account. Inreading the word of God, we should often pause, to inquire of whom andof what the sacred writers spake; but especially our thoughts should beemployed about the Redeemer. The Ethiopian was convinced by theteaching of the Holy Spirit, of the exact fulfilment of the Scripture,was made to understand the nature of the Messiah's kingdom andsalvation, and desired to be numbered among the disciples of Christ.Those who seek the truth, and employ their time in searching theScriptures, will be sure to reap advantages. The avowal of theEthiopian must be understood as expressing simple reliance on Christfor salvation, and unreserved devotion to Him. Let us not be satisfiedtill we get faith, as the Ethiopian did, by diligent study of the HolyScriptures, and the teaching of the Spirit of God; let us not besatisfied till we get it fixed as a principle in our hearts. As soon ashe was baptized, the Spirit of God took Philip from him, so that he sawhim no more; but this tended to confirm his faith. When the inquirerafter salvation becomes acquainted with Jesus and his gospel, he willgo on his way rejoicing, and will fill up his station in society, anddischarge his duties, from other motives, and in another manner thanheretofore. Though baptized in the name of the Father, Son, and HolyGhost, with water, it is not enough without the baptism of the HolyGhost. Lord, grant this to every one of us; then shall we go on our wayrejoicing.
Act 9:1-9	<br>So ill informed was Saul, that he thought he ought to do all he couldagainst the name of Christ, and that he did God service thereby; heseemed to breathe in this as in his element. Let us not despair ofrenewing grace for the conversion of the greatest sinners, nor let suchdespair of the pardoning mercy of God for the greatest sin. It is asignal token of Divine favour, if God, by the inward working of hisgrace, or the outward events of his providence, stops us fromprosecuting or executing sinful purposes. Saul saw that Just One, ch.22:14; 26:13. How near to us is the unseen world! It is but for God todraw aside the veil, and objects are presented to the view, comparedwith which, whatever is most admired on earth is mean and contemptible.Saul submitted without reserve, desirous to know what the Lord Jesuswould have him to do. Christ's discoveries of himself to poor souls arehumbling; they lay them very low, in mean thoughts of themselves. Forthree days Saul took no food, and it pleased God to leave him for thattime without relief. His sins were now set in order before him; he wasin the dark concerning his own spiritual state, and wounded in spiritfor sin. When a sinner is brought to a proper sense of his own stateand conduct, he will cast himself wholly on the mercy of the Saviour,asking what he would have him to do. God will direct the humbledsinner, and though he does not often bring transgressors to joy andpeace in believing, without sorrows and distress of conscience, underwhich the soul is deeply engaged as to eternal things, yet happy arethose who sow in tears, for they shall reap in joy.
Act 9:10-22	<br>A good work was begun in Saul, when he was brought to Christ's feetwith those words, Lord, what wilt thou have me to do? And never didChrist leave any who were brought to that. Behold, the proud Pharisee,the unmerciful oppressor, the daring blasphemer, prayeth! And thus itis even now, and with the proud infidel, or the abandoned sinner. Whathappy tidings are these to all who understand the nature and power ofprayer, of such prayer as the humbled sinner presents for the blessingsof free salvation! Now he began to pray after another manner than hehad done; before, he said his prayers, now, he prayed them.Regenerating grace sets people on praying; you may as well find aliving man without breath, as a living Christian without prayer. Yeteven eminent disciples, like Ananias, sometimes stagger at the commandsof the Lord. But it is the Lord's glory to surpass our scantyexpectations, and show that those are vessels of his mercy whom we areapt to consider as objects of his vengeance. The teaching of the HolySpirit takes away the scales of ignorance and pride from theunderstanding; then the sinner becomes a new creature, and endeavoursto recommend the anointed Saviour, the Son of God, to his formercompanions.
Act 9:23-31	<br>When we enter into the way of God, we must look for trials; but theLord knows how to deliver the godly, and will, with the temptation,also make a way to escape. Though Saul's conversion was and is a proofof the truth of Christianity, yet it could not, of itself, convert onesoul at enmity with the truth; for nothing can produce true faith, butthat power which new-creates the heart. Believers are apt to be toosuspicious of those against whom they have prejudices. The world isfull of deceit, and it is necessary to be cautious, but we mustexercise charity, 1Co 13:5. The Lord will clear up the characters oftrue believers; and he will bring them to his people, and often givesthem opportunities of bearing testimony to his truth, before those whoonce witnessed their hatred to it. Christ now appeared to Saul, andordered him to go quickly out of Jerusalem, for he must be sent to theGentiles: see ch. 22:21. Christ's witnesses cannot be slain till theyhave finished their testimony. The persecutions were stayed. Theprofessors of the gospel walked uprightly, and enjoyed much comfortfrom the Holy Ghost, in the hope and peace of the gospel, and otherswere won over to them. They lived upon the comfort of the Holy Ghost,not only in the days of trouble and affliction, but in days of rest andprosperity. Those are most likely to walk cheerfully, who walkcircumspectly.
Act 9:32-35	<br>Christians are saints, or holy people; not only the eminent ones, asSaint Peter and Saint Paul, but every sincere professor of the faith ofChrist. Christ chose patients whose diseases were incurable in thecourse of nature, to show how desperate was the case of fallen mankind.When we were wholly without strength, as this poor man, he sent hisword to heal us. Peter does not pretend to heal by any power of hisown, but directs Eneas to look up to Christ for help. Let none say,that because it is Christ, who, by the power of his grace, works allour works in us, therefore we have no work, no duty to do; for thoughJesus Christ makes thee whole, yet thou must arise, and use the powerhe gives thee.
Act 9:36-43	<br>Many are full of good words, who are empty and barren in good works;but Tabitha was a great doer, no great talker. Christians who have notproperty to give in charity, may yet be able to do acts of charity,working with their hands, or walking with their feet, for the good ofothers. Those are certainly best praised whose own works praise them,whether the words of others do so or not. But such are ungratefulindeed, who have kindness shown them, and will not acknowledge it, byshowing the kindness that is done them. While we live upon the fulnessof Christ for our whole salvation, we should desire to be full of goodworks, for the honour of his name, and for the benefit of his saints.Such characters as Dorcas are useful where they dwell, as showing theexcellency of the word of truth by their lives. How mean then the caresof the numerous females who seek no distinction but outward decoration,and who waste their lives in the trifling pursuits of dress and vanity!Power went along with the word, and Dorcas came to life. Thus in theraising of dead souls to spiritual life, the first sign of life is theopening of the eyes of the mind. Here we see that the Lord can make upevery loss; that he overrules every event for the good of those whotrust in him, and for the glory of his name.
Act 10:1-8	<br>Hitherto none had been baptized into the Christian church but Jews,Samaritans, and those converts who had been circumcised and observedthe ceremonial law; but now the Gentiles were to be called to partakeall the privileges of God's people, without first becoming Jews. Pureand undefiled religion is sometimes found where we least expect it.Wherever the fear of God rules in the heart, it will appear both inworks of charity and of piety, neither will excuse from the other.Doubtless Cornelius had true faith in God's word, as far as heunderstood it, though not as yet clear faith in Christ. This was thework of the Spirit of God, through the mediation of Jesus, even beforeCornelius knew him, as is the case with us all when we, who before weredead in sin, are made alive. Through Christ also his prayers and almswere accepted, which otherwise would have been rejected. Withoutdispute or delay Cornelius was obedient to the heavenly vision. In theaffairs of our souls, let us not lose time.
Act 10:9-18	<br>The prejudices of Peter against the Gentiles, would have prevented hisgoing to Cornelius, unless the Lord had prepared him for this service.To tell a Jew that God had directed those animals to be reckoned cleanwhich were hitherto deemed unclean, was in effect saying, that the lawof Moses was done away. Peter was soon made to know the meaning of it.God knows what services are before us, and how to prepare us; and weknow the meaning of what he has taught us, when we find what occasionwe have to make use of it.
Act 10:19-33	<br>When we see our call clear to any service, we should not be perplexedwith doubts and scruples arising from prejudices or former ideas.Cornelius had called together his friends, to partake with him of theheavenly wisdom he expected from Peter. We should not covet to eat ourspiritual morsels alone. It ought to be both given and taken askindness and respect to our kindred and friends, to invite them to joinus in religious exercises. Cornelius declared the direction God gavehim to send for Peter. We are right in our aims in attending a gospelministry, when we do it with regard to the Divine appointment requiringus to make use of that ordinance. How seldom ministers are called tospeak to such companies, however small, in which it may be said thatthey are all present in the sight of God, to hear all things that arecommanded of God! But these were ready to hear what Peter was commandedof God to say.
Act 10:34-43	<br>Acceptance cannot be obtained on any other ground than that of thecovenant of mercy, through the atonement of Christ; but wherever truereligion is found, God will accept it without regarding names or sects.The fear of God and works of righteousness are the substance of truereligion, the effects of special grace. Though these are not the causeof a man's acceptance, yet they show it; and whatever may be wanting inknowledge or faith, will in due time be given by Him who has begun it.They knew in general the word, that is, the gospel, which God sent tothe children of Israel. The purport of this word was, that God by itpublished the good tidings of peace by Jesus Christ. They knew theseveral matters of fact relating to the gospel. They knew the baptismof repentance which John preached. Let them know that this JesusChrist, by whom peace is made between God and man, is Lord of all; notonly as over all, God blessed for evermore, but as Mediator. All power,both in heaven and in earth, is put into his hand, and all judgmentcommitted to him. God will go with those whom he anoints; he will bewith those to whom he has given his Spirit. Peter then declaresChrist's resurrection from the dead, and the proofs of it. Faith hasreference to a testimony, and the Christian faith is built upon thefoundation of the apostles and prophets, on the testimony given bythem. See what must be believed concerning him. That we are allaccountable to Christ as our Judge; so every one must seek his favour,and to have him as our Friend. And if we believe in him, we shall allbe justified by him as our Righteousness. The remission of sins lays afoundation for all other favours and blessings, by taking that out ofthe way which hinders the bestowing of them. If sin be pardoned, all iswell, and shall end well for ever.
Act 10:44-48	<br>The Holy Ghost fell upon others after they were baptized, to confirmthem in the faith; but upon these Gentiles before they were baptized,to show that God does not confine himself to outward signs. The HolyGhost fell upon those who were neither circumcised nor baptized; it isthe Spirit that quickeneth, the flesh profiteth nothing. They magnifiedGod, and spake of Christ and the benefits of redemption. Whatever giftwe are endued with, we ought to honour God with it. The believing Jewswho were present, were astonished that the gift of the Holy Ghost waspoured out upon the Gentiles also. By mistaken notions of things, wemake difficult for ourselves as to the methods of Divine providence andgrace. As they were undeniably baptized with the Holy Ghost, Peterconcluded they were not to be refused the baptism of water, and theordinance was administered. The argument is conclusive; can we deny thesign to those who have received the things signified? Those who havesome acquaintance with Christ, cannot but desire more. Even those whohave received the Holy Ghost, must see their need of daily learningmore of the truth.
Act 11:1-18	<br>The imperfect state of human nature strongly appears, when godlypersons are displeased even to hear that the word of God has beenreceived, because their own system has not been attended to. And we aretoo apt to despair of doing good to those who yet, when tried, provevery teachable. It is the bane and damage of the church, to shut outthose from it, and from the benefit of the means of grace, who are notin every thing as we are. Peter stated the whole affair. We should atall times bear with the infirmities of our brethren; and instead oftaking offence, or answering with warmth, we should explain ourmotives, and show the nature of our proceedings. That preaching iscertainly right, with which the Holy Ghost is given. While men are veryzealous for their own regulations, they should take care that they donot withstand God; and those who love the Lord will glorify him, whenmade sure that he has given repentance to life to any fellow-sinners.Repentance is God's gift; not only his free grace accepts it, but hismighty grace works it in us, grace takes away the heart of stone, andgives us a heart of flesh. The sacrifice of God is a broken spirit.
Act 11:19-24	<br>The first preachers of the gospel at Antioch, were dispersed fromJerusalem by persecution; thus what was meant to hurt the church, wasmade to work for its good. The wrath of man is made to praise God. Whatshould the ministers of Christ preach, but Christ? Christ, and himcrucified? Christ, and him glorified? And their preaching wasaccompanied with the Divine power. The hand of the Lord was with them,to bring that home to the hearts and consciences of men, which theycould but speak to the outward ear. They believed; they were convincedof the truth of the gospel. They turned from a careless, carnal way ofliving, to live a holy, heavenly, spiritual life. They turned fromworshipping God in show and ceremony, to worship him in the Spirit andin truth. They turned to the Lord Jesus, and he became all in all withthem. This was the work of conversion wrought upon them, and it must bewrought upon every one of us. It was the fruit of their faith; all whosincerely believe, will turn to the Lord, When the Lord Jesus ispreached in simplicity, and according to the Scriptures, he will givesuccess; and when sinners are thus brought to the Lord, really goodmen, who are full of faith and of the Holy Ghost, will admire andrejoice in the grace of God bestowed on them. Barnabas was full offaith; full of the grace of faith, and full of the fruits of the faiththat works by love.
Act 11:25-30	<br>Hitherto the followers of Christ were called disciples, that is,learners, scholars; but from that time they were called Christians. Theproper meaning of this name is, a follower of Christ; it denotes onewho, from serious thought, embraces the religion of Christ, believeshis promises, and makes it his chief care to shape his life by Christ'sprecepts and example. Hence it is plain that multitudes take the nameof Christian to whom it does not rightly belong. But the name withoutthe reality will only add to our guilt. While the bare profession willbestow neither profit nor delight, the possession of it will give boththe promise of the life that now is, and of that which is to come.Grant, Lord, that Christians may forget other names and distinctions,and love one another as the followers of Christ ought to do. TrueChristians will feel for their brethren under afflictions. Thus willfruit be brought forth to the praise and glory of God. If all mankindwere true Christians, how cheerfully would they help one another! Thewhole earth would be like one large family, every member of which wouldstrive to be dutiful and kind.
Act 12:1-5	<br>James was one of the sons of Zebedee, whom Christ told that they shoulddrink of the cup that he was to drink of, and be baptized with thebaptism that he was to be baptized with, Mt 20:23. Now the words ofChrist were made good in him; and if we suffer with Christ, we shallreign with him. Herod imprisoned Peter: the way of persecution, as ofother sins, is downhill; when men are in it, they cannot easily stop.Those make themselves an easy prey to Satan, who make it their businessto please men. Thus James finished his course. But Peter, beingdesigned for further services, was safe; though he seemed now markedout for a speedy sacrifice. We that live in a cold, prayerlessgeneration, can hardly form an idea of the earnestness of these holymen of old. But if the Lord should bring on the church an awfulpersecution like this of Herod, the faithful in Christ would learn whatsoul-felt prayer is.
Act 12:6-11	<br>A peaceful conscience, a lively hope, and the consolations of the HolySpirit, can keep men calm in the full prospect of death; even thosevery persons who have been most distracted with terrors on thataccount. God's time to help, is when things are brought to the lastextremity. Peter was assured that the Lord would cause this trial toend in the way that should be most for his glory. Those who aredelivered out of spiritual imprisonment must follow their Deliverer,like the Israelites when they went out of the house of bondage. Theyknew not whither they went, but knew whom they followed. When God willwork salvation for his people, all difficulties in their way will beovercome, even gates of iron are made to open of their own accord. Thisdeliverance of Peter represents our redemption by Christ, which notonly proclaims liberty to the captives, but brings them out of theprison-house. Peter, when he recollected himself, perceived what greatthings God had done for him. Thus souls delivered out of spiritualbondage, are not at first aware what God has wrought in them; many havethe truth of grace, that want evidence of it. But when the Comfortercomes, whom the Father will send, sooner or later, he will let themknow what a blessed change is wrought.
Act 12:12-19	<br>God's providence leaves room for the use of our prudence, though he hasundertaken to perform and perfect what he has begun. These Christianscontinued in prayer for Peter, for they were truly in earnest. Thus menought always to pray, and not to faint. As long as we are kept waitingfor a mercy, we must continue praying for it. But sometimes that whichwe most earnestly wish for, we are most backward to believe. TheChristian law of self-denial and of suffering for Christ, has not doneaway the natural law of caring for our own safety by lawful means. Intimes of public danger, all believers have God for their hiding-place;which is so secret, that the world cannot find them. Also, theinstruments of persecution are themselves exposed to danger; the wrathof God hangs over all that engage in this hateful work. And the rangeof persecutors often vents itself on all in its way.
Act 12:20-25	<br>Many heathen princes claimed and received Divine honours, but it wasfar more horrible impiety in Herod, who knew the word and worship ofthe living God, to accept such idolatrous honours without rebuking theblasphemy. And such men as Herod, when puffed with pride and vanity,are ripening fast for signal vengeance. God is very jealous for his ownhonour, and will be glorified upon those whom he is not glorified by.See what vile bodies we carry about with us; they have in them theseeds of their own dissolution, by which they will soon be destroyed,whenever God does but speak the word. We may learn wisdom from thepeople of Tyre and Sidon, for we have offended the Lord with our sins.We depend on him for life, and breath, and all things; it surely thenbehoves us to humble ourselves before him, that through the appointedMediator, who is ever ready to befriend us, we may be reconciled tohim, lest wrath come upon us to the utmost.
Act 13:1-3	<br>What an assemblage was here! In these names we see that the Lord raisesup instruments for his work, from various places and stations in life;and zeal for his glory induces men to give up flattering connexions andprospects to promote his cause. It is by the Spirit of Christ that hisministers are made both able and willing for his service, and takenfrom other cares that would hinder in it. Christ's ministers are to beemployed in Christ's work, and, under the Spirit's guidance, to act forthe glory of God the Father. They are separated to take pains, and notto take state. A blessing upon Barnabas and Saul in their presentundertaking was sought for, and that they might be filled with the HolyGhost in their work. Whatever means are used, or rules observed, theHoly Ghost alone can fit ministers for their important work, and callthem to it.
Act 13:4-13	<br>Satan is in a special manner busy with great men and men in power, tokeep them from being religious, for their example will influence many.Saul is here for the first time called Paul, and never after Saul. Saulwas his name as he was a Hebrew; Paul was his name as he was a citizenof Rome. Under the direct influence of the Holy Ghost, he gave Elymashis true character, but not in passion. A fulness of deceit andmischief together, make a man indeed a child of the devil. And thosewho are enemies to the doctrine of Jesus, are enemies to allrighteousness; for in it all righteousness is fulfilled. The ways ofthe Lord Jesus are the only right ways to heaven and happiness. Thereare many who not only wander from these ways themselves, but set othersagainst these ways. They commonly are so hardened, that they will notcease to do evil. The proconsul was astonished at the force of thedoctrine upon his own heart and conscience, and at the power of God bywhich it was confirmed. The doctrine of Christ astonishes; and the morewe know of it, the more reason we shall see to wonder at it. Those whoput their hand to the plough and look back, are not fit for the kingdomof God. Those who are not prepared to face opposition, and to endurehardship, are not fitted for the work of the ministry.
Act 13:14-31	<br>When we come together to worship God, we must do it, not only by prayerand praise, but by the reading and hearing of the word of God. The barereading of the Scriptures in public assemblies is not enough; theyshould be expounded, and the people exhorted out of them. This ishelping people in doing that which is necessary to make the wordprofitable, to apply it to themselves. Every thing is touched upon inthis sermon, which might best prevail with Jews to receive and embraceChrist as the promised Messiah. And every view, however short or faint,of the Lord's dealings with his church, reminds us of his mercy andlong-suffering, and of man's ingratitude and perverseness. Paul passesfrom David to the Son of David, and shows that this Jesus is hispromised Seed; a Saviour to do that for them, which the judges of oldcould not do, to save them from their sins, their worst enemies. Whenthe apostles preached Christ as the Saviour, they were so far fromconcealing his death, that they always preached Christ crucified. Ourcomplete separation from sin, is represented by our being buried withChrist. But he rose again from the dead, and saw no corruption: thiswas the great truth to be preached.
Act 13:32-37	<br>The resurrection of Christ was the great proof of his being the Son ofGod. It was not possible he should be held by death, because he was theSon of God, and therefore had life in himself, which he could not laydown but with a design to take it again. The sure mercies of David arethat everlasting life, of which the resurrection was a sure pledge; andthe blessings of redemption in Christ are a certain earnest, even inthis world. David was a great blessing to the age wherein he lived. Wewere not born for ourselves, but there are those living around us, towhom we must study to be serviceable. Yet here is the difference;Christ was to serve all generations. May we look to Him who is declaredto be the Son of God by his resurrection from the dead, that by faithin him we may walk with God, and serve our generation according to hiswill; and when death comes, may we fall asleep in him, with a joyfulhope of a blessed resurrection.
Act 13:38-41	<br>Let all that hear the gospel of Christ, know these two things: 1. Thatthrough this Man, who died and rose again, is preached unto you theforgiveness of sins. Your sins, though many and great, may be forgiven,and they may be so without any injury to God's honour. 2. It is byChrist only that those who believe in him, and none else, are justifiedfrom all things; from all the guilt and stain of sin, from which theycould not be justified by the law of Moses. The great concern ofconvinced sinners is, to be justified, to be acquitted from all theirguilt, and accepted as righteous in God's sight, for if any is leftcharged upon the sinner, he is undone. By Jesus Christ we obtain acomplete justification; for by him a complete atonement was made forsin. We are justified, not only by him as our Judge but by him as theLord our Righteousness. What the law could not do for us, in that itwas weak, the gospel of Christ does. This is the most needful blessing,bringing in every other. The threatenings are warnings; what we aretold will come upon impenitent sinners, is designed to awaken us tobeware lest it come upon us. It ruins many, that they despise religion.Those that will not wonder and be saved, shall wonder and perish.
Act 13:42-52	<br>The Jews opposed the doctrine the apostles preached; and when theycould find no objection, they blasphemed Christ and his gospel.Commonly those who begin with contradicting, end with blaspheming. Butwhen adversaries of Christ's cause are daring, its advocates should bethe bolder. And while many judge themselves unworthy of eternal life,others, who appear less likely, desire to hear more of the glad tidingsof salvation. This is according to what was foretold in the OldTestament. What light, what power, what a treasure does this gospelbring with it! How excellent are its truths, its precepts, itspromises! Those came to Christ whom the Father drew, and to whom theSpirit made the gospel call effectual, Ro 8:30. As many as weredisposed to eternal life, as many as had concern about their eternalstate, and aimed to make sure of eternal life, believed in Christ, inwhom God has treasured up that life, and who is the only Way to it; andit was the grace of God that wrought it in them. It is good to seehonourable women devout; the less they have to do in the world, themore they should do for their own souls, and the souls of others: butit is sad, when, under colour of devotion to God, they try to showhatred to Christ. And the more we relish the comforts andencouragements we meet with in the power of godliness, and the fullerour hearts are of them, the better prepared we are to face difficultiesin the profession of godliness.
Act 14:1-7	<br>The apostles spake so plainly, with such evidence and proof of theSpirit, and with such power; so warmly, and with such concern for thesouls of men; that those who heard them could not but say, God was withthem of a truth. Yet the success was not to be reckoned to the mannerof their preaching, but to the Spirit of God who used that means.Perseverance in doing good, amidst dangers and hardships, is a blessedevidence of grace. Wherever God's servants are driven, they should seekto declare the truth. When they went on in Christ's name and strength,he failed not to give testimony to the word of his grace. He hasassured us it is the word of God, and that we may venture our soulsupon it. The Gentiles and Jews were at enmity with one another, yetunited against Christians. If the church's enemies join to destroy it,shall not its friends unite for its preservation? God has a shelter forhis people in a storm; he is, and will be their Hiding-place. In timesof persecution, believers may see cause to quit a spot, though they donot quit their Master's work.
Act 14:8-18	<br>All things are possible to those that believe. When we have faith, thatmost precious gift of God, we shall be delivered from the spiritualhelplessness in which we were born, and from the dominion of sinfulhabits since formed; we shall be made able to stand upright and walkcheerfully in the ways of the Lord. When Christ, the Son of God,appeared in the likeness of men, and did many miracles, men were so farfrom doing sacrifice to him, that they made him a sacrifice to theirpride and malice; but Paul and Barnabas, upon their working onemiracle, were treated as gods. The same power of the god of this world,which closes the carnal mind against truth, makes errors and mistakesfind easy admission. We do not learn that they rent their clothes whenthe people spake of stoning them; but when they spake of worshippingthem; they could not bear it, being more concerned for God's honourthan their own. God's truth needs not the services of man's falsehood.The servants of God might easily obtain undue honours if they wouldwink at men's errors and vices; but they must dread and detest suchrespect more than any reproach. When the apostles preached to the Jews,who hated idolatry, they had only to preach the grace of God in Christ;but when they had to do with the Gentiles, they must set right theirmistakes in natural religion. Compare their conduct and declarationwith the false opinions of those who think the worship of a God, underany name, or in any manner, is equally acceptable to the Lord Almighty.The most powerful arguments, the most earnest and affectionateaddresses, even with miracles, are scarcely enough to keep men fromabsurdities and abominations; much less can they, without specialgrace, turn the hearts of sinners to God and to holiness.
Act 14:19-28	<br>See how restless the rage of the Jews was against the gospel of Christ.The people stoned Paul, in a popular tumult. So strong is the bent ofthe corrupt and carnal heart, that as it is with great difficulty thatmen are kept back from evil on one side, so it is with great ease theyare persuaded to evil on the other side. If Paul would have beenMercury, he might have been worshipped; but if he will be a faithfulminister of Christ, he shall be stoned, and thrown out of the city.Thus men who easily submit to strong delusions, hate to receive thetruth in the love of it. All who are converted need to be confirmed inthe faith; all who are planted need to be rooted. Ministers' work is toestablish saints as well as to awaken sinners. The grace of God, andnothing less, effectually establishes the souls of the disciples. It istrue, we must count upon much tribulation, but it is encouragement thatwe shall not be lost and perish in it. The Person to whose power andgrace the converts and the newly-established churches are commended,clearly was the Lord Jesus, "on whom they had believed." It was an actof worship. The praise of all the little good we do at any time, mustbe ascribed to God; for it is He who not only worketh in us both towill and to do, but also worketh with us to make what we do successful.All who love the Lord Jesus, will rejoice to hear that he has openedthe door of faith wide, to those who were strangers to him and to hissalvation. And let us, like the apostles, abide with those who know andlove the Lord.
Act 15:1-6	<br>Some from Judea taught the Gentile converts at Antioch, that they couldnot be saved, unless they observed the whole ceremonial law as given byMoses; and thus they sought to destroy Christian liberty. There is astrange proneness in us to think that all do wrong who do not just aswe do. Their doctrine was very discouraging. Wise and good men desireto avoid contests and disputes as far as they can; yet when falseteachers oppose the main truths of the gospel, or bring in hurtfuldoctrines, we must not decline to oppose them.
Act 15:7-21	<br>We see from the words "purifying their hearts by faith," and theaddress of St. Peter, that justification by faith, and sanctificationby the Holy Ghost, cannot be separated; and that both are the gift ofGod. We have great cause to bless God that we have heard the gospel.May we have that faith which the great Searcher of hearts approves, andattests by the seal of the Holy Spirit. Then our hearts and conscienceswill be purified from the guilt of sin, and we shall be freed from theburdens some try to lay upon the disciples of Christ. Paul and Barnabasshowed by plain matters of fact, that God owned the preaching of thepure gospel to the Gentiles without the law of Moses; therefore topress that law upon them, was to undo what God had done. The opinion ofJames was, that the Gentile converts ought not to be troubled aboutJewish rites, but that they should abstain from meats offered to idols,so that they might show their hatred of idolatry. Also, that theyshould be cautioned against fornication, which was not abhorred by theGentiles as it should be, and even formed a part of some of theirrites. They were counselled to abstain from things strangled, and fromeating blood; this was forbidden by the law of Moses, and also here,from reverence to the blood of the sacrifices, which being then stilloffered, it would needlessly grieve the Jewish converts, and furtherprejudice the unconverted Jews. But as the reason has long ceased, weare left free in this, as in the like matters. Let converts be warnedto avoid all appearances of the evils which they formerly practised, orare likely to be tempted to; and caution them to use Christian libertywith moderation and prudence.
Act 15:22-35	<br>Being warranted to declare themselves directed by the immediateinfluence of the Holy Ghost, the apostles and disciples were assuredthat it seemed good unto God the Holy Spirit, as well as to them, tolay upon the converts no other burden than the things before mentioned,which were necessary, either on their own account, or from presentcircumstances. It was a comfort to hear that carnal ordinances were nolonger imposed on them, which perplexed the conscience, but could notpurify or pacify it; and that those who troubled their minds weresilenced, so that the peace of the church was restored, and that whichthreatened division was removed. All this was consolation for whichthey blessed God. Many others were at Antioch. Where many labour in theword and doctrine, yet there may be opportunity for us: the zeal andusefulness of others should stir us up, not lay us asleep.
Act 15:36-41	<br>Here we have a private quarrel between two ministers, no less than Pauland Barnabas, yet made to end well. Barnabas wished his nephew JohnMark to go with them. We should suspect ourselves of being partial, andguard against this in putting our relations forward. Paul did not thinkhim worthy of the honour, nor fit for the service, who had departedfrom them without their knowledge, or without their consent: see ch.13:13. Neither would yield, therefore there was no remedy but they mustpart. We see that the best of men are but men, subject to like passionsas we are. Perhaps there were faults on both sides, as usual in suchcontentions. Christ's example alone, is a copy without a blot. Yet weare not to think it strange, if there are differences among wise andgood men. It will be so while we are in this imperfect state; we shallnever be all of one mind till we come to heaven. But what mischief theremainders of pride and passion which are found even in good men, do inthe world, and do in the church! Many who dwelt at Antioch, who hadheard but little of the devotedness and piety of Paul and Barnabas,heard of their dispute and separation; and thus it will be withourselves, if we give way to contention. Believers must be constant inprayer, that they may never be led by the allowance of unholy tempers,to hurt the cause they really desire to serve. Paul speaks with esteemand affection both of Barnabas and Mark, in his epistles, written afterthis event. May all who profess thy name, O loving Saviour, bethoroughly reconciled by that love derived from thee which is noteasily provoked, and which soon forgets and buries injuries.
Act 16:1-5	<br>Well may the church look for much service from youthful ministers whoset out in the same spirit as Timothy. But when men will submit innothing, and oblige in nothing, the first elements of the Christiantemper seem to be wanting; and there is great reason to believe thatthe doctrines and precepts of the gospel will not be successfullytaught. The design of the decree being to set aside the ceremonial law,and its carnal ordinances, believers were confirmed in the Christianfaith, because it set up a spiritual way of serving God, as suited tothe nature both of God and man. Thus the church increased in numbersdaily.
Act 16:6-15	<br>The removals of ministers, and the dispensing the means of grace bythem, are in particular under Divine conduct and direction. We mustfollow Providence: and whatever we seek to do, if that suffer us not,we ought to submit and believe to be for the best. People greatly needhelp for their souls, it is their duty to look out for it, and toinvite those among them who can help them. And God's calls must becomplied with readily. A solemn assembly the worshippers of God musthave, if possible, upon the sabbath day. If we have not synagogues, wemust be thankful for more private places, and resort to them; notforsaking the assembling together, as our opportunities are. Among thehearers of Paul was a woman, named Lydia. She had an honest calling,which the historian notices to her praise. Yet though she had a callingto mind, she found time to improve advantages for her soul. It will notexcuse us from religious duties, to say, We have a trade to mind; forhave not we also a God to serve, and souls to look after? Religion doesnot call us from our business in the world, but directs us in it.Pride, prejudice, and sin shut out the truths of God, till his gracemakes way for them into the understanding and affections; and the Lordalone can open the heart to receive and believe his word. We mustbelieve in Jesus Christ; there is no coming to God as a Father, but bythe Son as Mediator.
Act 16:16-24	<br>Satan, though the father of lies, will declare the most importanttruths, when he can thereby serve his purposes. But much mischief isdone to the real servants of Christ, by unholy and false preachers ofthe gospel, who are confounded with them by careless observers. Thosewho do good by drawing men from sin, may expect to be reviled astroublers of the city. While they teach men to fear God, to believe inChrist, to forsake sin, and to live godly lives, they will be accusedof teaching bad customs.
Act 16:25-34	<br>The consolations of God to his suffering servants are neither few norsmall. How much more happy are true Christians than their prosperousenemies! As in the dark, so out of the depths, we may cry unto God. Noplace, no time is amiss for prayer, if the heart be lifted up to God.No trouble, however grievous, should hinder us from praise.Christianity proves itself to be of God, in that it obliges us to bejust to our own lives. Paul cried aloud to make the jailer hear, and tomake him heed, saying, Do thyself no harm. All the cautions of the wordof God against sin, and all appearances of it, and approaches to it,have this tendency. Man, woman, do not ruin thyself; hurt not thyself,and then none else can hurt thee; do not sin, for nothing but that canhurt thee. Even as to the body, we are cautioned against the sins whichdo harm to that. Converting grace changes people's language of and togood people and good ministers. How serious the jailer's inquiry! Hissalvation becomes his great concern; that lies nearest his heart, whichbefore was furthest from his thoughts. It is his own precious soul thathe is concerned about. Those who are thoroughly convinced of sin, andtruly concerned about their salvation, will give themselves up toChrist. Here is the sum of the whole gospel, the covenant of grace in afew words; Believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved,and thy house. The Lord so blessed the word, that the jailer was atonce softened and humbled. He treated them with kindness andcompassion, and, professing faith in Christ, was baptized in that name,with his family. The Spirit of grace worked such a strong faith inthem, as did away further doubt; and Paul and Silas knew by the Spirit,that a work of God was wrought in them. When sinners are thusconverted, they will love and honour those whom they before despisedand hated, and will seek to lessen the suffering they before desired toincrease. When the fruits of faith begin to appear, terrors will befollowed by confidence and joy in God.
Act 16:35-40	<br>Paul, though willing to suffer for the cause of Christ, and without anydesire to avenge himself, did not choose to depart under the charge ofhaving deserved wrongful punishment, and therefore required to bedismissed in an honourable manner. It was not a mere point of honourthat the apostle stood upon, but justice, and not to himself so much asto his cause. And when proper apology is made, Christians should neverexpress personal anger, nor insist too strictly upon personal amends.The Lord will make them more than conquerors in every conflict; insteadof being cast down by their sufferings, they will become comforters oftheir brethren.
Act 17:1-9	<br>The drift and scope of Paul's preaching and arguing, was to prove thatJesus is the Christ. He must needs suffer for us, because he could nototherwise purchase our redemption for us; and he must needs have risenagain, because he could not otherwise apply the redemption to us. Weare to preach concerning Jesus that he is Christ; therefore we may hopeto be saved by him, and are bound to be ruled by him. The unbelievingJews were angry, because the apostles preached to the Gentiles, thatthey might be saved. How strange it is, that men should grudge othersthe privileges they will not themselves accept! Neither rulers norpeople need be troubled at the increase of real Christians, even thoughturbulent spirits should make religion the pretext for evil designs. Ofsuch let us beware, from such let us withdraw, that we may show adesire to act aright in society, while we claim our right to worshipGod according to our consciences.
Act 17:10-15	<br>The Jews in Berea applied seriously to the study of the word preachedunto them. They not only heard Paul preach on the sabbath, but dailysearched the Scriptures, and compared what they read with the factsrelated to them. The doctrine of Christ does not fear inquiry;advocates for his cause desire no more than that people will fully andfairly examine whether things are so or not. Those are truly noble, andlikely to be more and more so, who make the Scriptures their rule, andconsult them accordingly. May all the hearers of the gospel become likethose of Berea, receiving the word with readiness of mind, andsearching the Scriptures daily, whether the things preached to them areso.
Act 17:16-21	<br>Athens was then famed for polite learning, philosophy, and the finearts; but none are more childish and superstitious, more impious, ormore credulous, than some persons, deemed eminent for learning andability. It was wholly given to idolatry. The zealous advocate for thecause of Christ will be ready to plead for it in all companies, asoccasion offers. Most of these learned men took no notice of Paul; butsome, whose principles were the most directly contrary to Christianity,made remarks upon him. The apostle ever dwelt upon two points, whichare indeed the principal doctrines of Christianity, Christ and a futurestate; Christ our way, and heaven our end. They looked on this as verydifferent from the knowledge for many ages taught and professed atAthens; they desire to know more of it, but only because it was new andstrange. They led him to the place where judges sat who inquired intosuch matters. They asked about Paul's doctrine, not because it wasgood, but because it was new. Great talkers are always busy-bodies.They spend their time in nothing else, and a very uncomfortable accountthey have to give of their time who thus spend it. Time is precious,and we are concerned to employ it well, because eternity depends uponit, but much is wasted in unprofitable conversation.
Act 17:22-31	<br>Here we have a sermon to heathens, who worshipped false gods, and werewithout the true God in the world; and to them the scope of thediscourse was different from what the apostle preached to the Jews. Inthe latter case, his business was to lead his hearers by prophecies andmiracles to the knowledge of the Redeemer, and faith in him; in theformer, it was to lead them, by the common works of providence, to knowthe Creator, and worship Him. The apostle spoke of an altar he hadseen, with the inscription, "TO THE UNKNOWN GOD." This fact is statedby many writers. After multiplying their idols to the utmost, some atAthens thought there was another god of whom they had no knowledge. Andare there not many now called Christians, who are zealous in theirdevotions, yet the great object of their worship is to them an unknownGod? Observe what glorious things Paul here says of that God whom heserved, and would have them to serve. The Lord had long borne withidolatry, but the times of this ignorance were now ending, and by hisservants he now commanded all men every where to repent of theiridolatry. Each sect of the learned men would feel themselves powerfullyaffected by the apostle's discourse, which tended to show the emptinessor falsity of their doctrines.
Act 17:32-34	<br>The apostle was treated with more outward civility at Athens than insome other places; but none more despised his doctrine, or treated itwith more indifference. Of all subjects, that which deserves the mostattention gains the least. But those who scorn, will have to bear theconsequences, and the word will never be useless. Some will be found,who cleave to the Lord, and listen to his faithful servants.Considering the judgement to come, and Christ as our Judge, should urgeall to repent of sin, and turn to Him. Whatever matter is used, alldiscourses must lead to Him, and show his authority; our salvation, andresurrection, come from and by Him.
Act 18:1-6	<br>Though Paul was entitled to support from the churches he planted, andfrom the people to whom he preached, yet he worked at his calling. Anhonest trade, by which a man may get his bread, is not to be lookedupon with contempt by any. It was the custom of the Jews to bring uptheir children to some trade, though they gave them learning orestates. Paul was careful to prevent prejudices, even the mostunreasonable. The love of Christ is the best bond of the saints; andthe communings of the saints with each other, sweeten labour, contempt,and even persecution. Most of the Jews persisted in contradicting thegospel of Christ, and blasphemed. They would not believe themselves,and did all they could to keep others from believing. Paul hereuponleft them. He did not give over his work; for though Israel be notgathered, Christ and his gospel shall be glorious. The Jews could notcomplain, for they had the first offer. When some oppose the gospel, wemust turn to others. Grief that many persist in unbelief should notprevent gratitude for the conversion of some to Christ.
Act 18:7-11	<br>The Lord knows those that are his, yea, and those that shall be his;for it is by his work upon them that they become his. Let us notdespair concerning any place, when even in wicked Corinth Christ hadmuch people. He will gather in his chosen flock from the places wherethey are scattered Thus encouraged, the apostle continued at Corinth,and a numerous and flourishing church grew up.
Act 18:12-17	<br>Paul was about to show that he did not teach men to worship Godcontrary to law; but the judge would not allow the Jews to complain tohim of what was not within his office. It was right in Gallio that heleft the Jews to themselves in matters relating to their religion, butyet would not let them, under pretence of that, persecute another. Butit was wrong to speak slightly of a law and religion which he mighthave known to be of God, and which he ought to have acquainted himselfwith. In what way God is to be worshipped, whether Jesus be theMessiah, and whether the gospel be a Divine revelation, are notquestions of words and names, they are questions of vast importance.Gallio spoke as if he boasted of his ignorance of the Scriptures, as ifthe law of God was beneath his notice. Gallio cared for none of thesethings. If he cared not for the affronts of bad men, it wascommendable; but if he concerned not himself for the abuses done togood men, his indifference was carried too far. And those who see andhear of the sufferings of God's people, and have no feeling with them,or care for them, who do not pity and pray for them, are of the samespirit as Gallio, who cared for none of these things.
Act 18:18-23	<br>While Paul found he laboured not in vain, he continued labouring. Ourtimes are in God's hand; we purpose, but he disposes; therefore we mustmake all promises with submission to the will of God; not only ifprovidence permits, but if God does not otherwise direct our motions. Avery good refreshment it is to a faithful minister, to have for awhilethe society of his brethren. Disciples are compassed about withinfirmity; ministers must do what they can to strengthen them, bydirecting them to Christ, who is their Strength. Let us earnestly seek,in our several places, to promote the cause of Christ, forming plansthat appear to us most proper, but relying on the Lord to bring them topass if he sees good.
Act 18:24-28	<br>Apollos taught in the gospel of Christ, as far as John's ministry wouldcarry him, and no further. We cannot but think he had heard of Christ'sdeath and resurrection, but he was not informed as to the mystery ofthem. Though he had not the miraculous gifts of the Spirit, as theapostles, he made use of the gifts he had. The dispensation of theSpirit, whatever the measure of it may be, is given to every man toprofit withal. He was a lively, affectionate preacher; fervent inspirit. He was full of zeal for the glory of God and the salvation ofprecious souls. Here was a complete man of God, thoroughly furnishedfor his work. Aquila and Priscilla encouraged his ministry, byattendance upon it. They did not despise Apollos themselves, orundervalue him to others; but considered the disadvantages he hadlaboured under. And having themselves got knowledge in the truths ofthe gospel by their long intercourse with Paul, they told what theyknew to him. Young scholars may gain a great deal by converse with oldChristians. Those who do believe through grace, yet still need help. Aslong as they are in this world, there are remainders of unbelief, andsomething lacking in their faith to be perfected, and the work of faithto be fulfilled. If the Jews were convinced that Jesus is Christ, eventheir own law would teach them to hear him. The business of ministersis to preach Christ. Not only to preach the truth, but to prove anddefend it, with meekness, yet with power.
Act 19:1-7	<br>Paul, at Ephesus, found some religious persons, who looked to Jesus asthe Messiah. They had not been led to expect the miraculous powers ofthe Holy Ghost, nor were they informed that the gospel was especiallythe ministration of the Spirit. But they spake as ready to welcome thenotice of it. Paul shows them that John never design that those hebaptized should rest there, but told them that they should believe onHim who should come after him, that is, on Christ Jesus. Theythankfully accepted the discovery, and were baptized in the name of theLord Jesus. The Holy Ghost came upon them in a surprising, overpoweringmanner; they spake with tongues, and prophesied, as the apostles andthe first Gentile coverts did. Though we do not now expect miraculouspowers, yet all who profess to be disciples of Christ, should be calledon to examine whether they have received the seal of the Holy Ghost, inhis sanctifying influences, to the sincerity of their faith. Many seemnot to have heard that there is a Holy Ghost, and many deem all that isspoken concerning his graces and comforts, to be delusion. Of such itmay properly be inquired, "Unto what, then, were ye baptized?" for theyevidently know not the meaning of that outward sign on which they placegreat dependence.
Act 19:8-12	<br>When arguments and persuasions only harden men in unbelief andblasphemy, we must separate ourselves and others from such unholycompany. God was pleased to confirm the teaching of these holy men ofold, that if their hearers believed them not, they might believe theworks.
Act 19:13-20	<br>It was common, especially among the Jews, for persons to profess or totry to cast out evil spirits. If we resist the devil by faith inChrist, he will flee from us; but if we think to resist him by theusing of Christ's name, or his works, as a spell or charm, Satan willprevail against us. Where there is true sorrow for sin, there will befree confession of sin to God in every prayer and to man whom we haveoffended, when the case requires it. Surely if the word of Godprevailed among us, many lewd, infidel, and wicked books would beburned by their possessors. Will not these Ephesian converts rise up injudgement against professors, who traffic in such works for the sake ofgain, or allow themselves to possess them? If we desire to be inearnest in the great work of salvation, every pursuit and enjoymentmust be given up which hinders the effect of the gospel upon the mind,or loosens its hold upon the heart.
Act 19:21-31	<br>Persons who came from afar to pay their devotions at the temple ofEphesus, bought little silver shrines, or models of the temple, tocarry home with them. See how craftsmen make advantage to themselves ofpeople's superstition, and serve their worldly ends by it. Men arejealous for that by which they get their wealth; and many setthemselves against the gospel of Christ, because it calls men from allunlawful crafts, however much wealth is to be gotten by them. There arepersons who will stickle for what is most grossly absurd, unreasonable,and false; as this, that those are gods which are made with hands, ifit has but worldly interest on its side. The whole city was full ofconfusion, the common and natural effect of zeal for false religion.Zeal for the honour of Christ, and love to the brethren, encouragezealous believers to venture into danger. Friends will often be raisedup among those who are strangers to true religion, but have observedthe honest and consistent behaviour of Christians.
Act 19:32-41	<br>The Jews came forward in this tumult. Those who are thus careful todistinguish themselves from the servants of Christ now, and are afraidof being taken for them, shall have their doom accordingly in the greatday. One, having authority, at length stilled the noise. It is a verygood rule at all times, both in private and public affairs, not to behasty and rash in our motions, but to take time to consider; and alwaysto keep our passions under check. We ought to be quiet, and to donothing rashly; to do nothing in haste, of which we may repent atleisure. The regular methods of the law ought always to stop populartumults, and in well-governed nations will do so. Most people stand inawe of men's judgments more than of the judgement of God. How well itwere if we would thus quiet our disorderly appetites and passions, byconsidering the account we must shortly give to the Judge of heaven andearth! And see how the overruling providence of God keeps the publicpeace, by an unaccountable power over the spirits of men. Thus theworld is kept in some order, and men are held back from devouring eachother. We can scarcely look around but we see men act like Demetriusand the workmen. It is as safe to contend with wild beasts as with menenraged by party zeal and disappointed covetousness, who think that allarguments are answered, when they have shown that they grow rich by thepractices which are opposed. Whatever side in religious disputes, orwhatever name this spirit assumes, it is worldly, and should bediscountenanced by all who regard truth and piety. And let us not bedismayed; the Lord on high is mightier than the noise of many waters;he can still the rage of the people.
Act 20:1-6	<br>Tumults or opposition may constrain a Christian to remove from hisstation or alter his purpose, but his work and his pleasure will be thesame, wherever he goes. Paul thought it worth while to bestow five daysin going to Troas, though it was but for seven days' stay there; but heknew, and so should we, how to redeem even journeying time, and to makeit turn to some good account.
Act 20:7-12	<br>Though the disciples read, and meditated, and prayed, and sung apart,and thereby kept up communion with God, yet they came together toworship God, and so kept up their communion with one another. They cametogether on the first day of the week, the Lord's day. It is to bereligiously observed by all disciples of Christ. In the breaking of thebread, not only the breaking of Christ's body for us, to be a sacrificefor our sins, is remembered, but the breaking of Christ's body to us,to be food and a feast for our souls, is signified. In the early timesit was the custom to receive the Lord's supper every Lord's day, thuscelebrating the memorial of Christ's death. In this assembly Paulpreached. The preaching of the gospel ought to go with the sacraments.They were willing to hear, he saw they were so, and continued hisspeech till midnight. Sleeping when hearing the word, is an evil thing,a sign of low esteem of the word of God. We must do what we can toprevent being sleepy; not put ourselves to sleep, but get our heartsaffected with the word we hear, so as to drive sleep far away.Infirmity requires tenderness; but contempt requires severity. Itinterrupted the apostle's preaching; but was made to confirm hispreaching. Eutychus was brought to life again. And as they knew notwhen they should have Paul's company again, they made the best use ofit they could, and reckoned a night's sleep well lost for that purpose.How seldom are hours of repose broken for the purposes of devotion! buthow often for mere amusement or sinful revelry! So hard is it forspiritual life to thrive in the heart of man! so naturally do carnalpractices flourish there!
Act 20:13-16	<br>Paul hastened to Jerusalem, but tried to do good by the way, when goingfrom place to place, as every good man should do. In doing God's work,our own wills and those of our friends must often be crossed; we mustnot spend time with them when duty calls us another way.
Act 20:17-27	<br>The elders knew that Paul was no designing, self-seeking man. Those whowould in any office serve the Lord acceptably, and profitably toothers, must do it with humility. He was a plain preacher, one thatspoke his message so as to be understood. He was a powerful preacher;he preached the gospel as a testimony to them if they received it; butas a testimony against them if they rejected it. He was a profitablepreacher; one that aimed to inform their judgments, and reform theirhearts and lives. He was a painful preacher, very industrious in hiswork. He was a faithful preacher; he did not keep back reproofs whennecessary, nor keep back the preaching of the cross. He was a trulyChristian, evangelical preacher; he did not preach notions or doubtfulmatters; nor affairs of state or the civil government; but he preachedfaith and repentance. A better summary of these things, without whichthere is no salvation, cannot be given: even repentance towards God,and faith towards our Lord Jesus Christ, with their fruits and effects.Without these no sinner can escape, and with these none will come shortof eternal life. Let them not think that Paul left Asia for fear ofpersecution; he was in full expectation of trouble, yet resolved to goon, well assured that it was by Divine direction. Thanks be to God thatwe know not the things which shall befall us during the year, the week,the day which has begun. It is enough for the child of God to know thathis strength shall be equal to his day. He knows not, he would notknow, what the day before him shall bring forth. The powerfulinfluences of the Holy Spirit bind the true Christian to his duty. Evenwhen he expects persecution and affliction, the love of Christconstrains him to proceed. None of these things moved Paul from hiswork; they did not deprive him of his comfort. It is the business ofour life to provide for a joyful death. Believing that this was thelast time they should see him, he appeals concerning his integrity. Hehad preached to them the whole counsel of God. As he had preached tothem the gospel purely, so he had preached it to them entire; hefaithfully did his work, whether men would bear or forbear.
Act 20:28-38	<br>If the Holy Ghost has made ministers overseers of the flock, that is,shepherds, they must be true to their trust. Let them consider theirMaster's concern for the flock committed to their charge. It is thechurch He has purchased with his own blood. The blood was his as Man;yet so close is the union between the Divine and human nature, that itis there called the blood of God, for it was the blood of Him who isGod. This put such dignity and worth into it, as to ransom believersfrom all evil, and purchase all good. Paul spake about their souls withaffection and concern. They were full of care what would become ofthem. Paul directs them to look up to God with faith, and commends themto the word of God's grace, not only as the foundation of their hopeand the fountain of their joy, but as the rule of their walking. Themost advanced Christians are capable of growing, and will find the wordof grace help their growth. As those cannot be welcome guests to theholy God who are unsanctified; so heaven would be no heaven to them;but to all who are born again, and on whom the image of God is renewed,it is sure, as almighty power and eternal truth make it so. Herecommends himself to them as an example of not caring as to things ofthe present world; this they would find help forward their comfortablepassage through it. It might seem a hard saying, therefore Paul adds toit a saying of their Master's, which he would have them alwaysremember; "It is more blessed to give than to receive:" it seems theywere words often used to his disciples. The opinion of the children ofthis world, is contrary to this; they are afraid of giving, unless inhope of getting. Clear gain, is with them the most blessed thing thatcan be; but Christ tell us what is more blessed, more excellent. Itmakes us more like to God, who gives to all, and receives from none;and to the Lord Jesus, who went about doing good. This mind was inChrist Jesus, may it be in us also. It is good for friends, when theypart, to part with prayer. Those who exhort and pray for one another,may have many weeping seasons and painful separations, but they willmeet before the throne of God, to part no more. It was a comfort toall, that the presence of Christ both went with him and stayed withthem.
Act 21:1-7	<br>Providence must be acknowledged when our affairs go on well. WhereverPaul came, he inquired what disciples were there, and found them out.Foreseeing his troubles, from love to him, and concern for the church,they wrongly thought it would be most for the glory of God that heshould continue at liberty; but their earnestness to dissuade him fromit, renders his pious resolution the more illustrious. He has taught usby example, as well as by rule, to pray always, to pray withoutceasing. Their last farewell was sweetened with prayer.
Act 21:8-18	<br>Paul had express warning of his troubles, that when they came, theymight be no surprise or terror to him. The general notice given us,that through much tribulation we must enter into the kingdom of God,should be of the same use to us. Their weeping began to weaken andslacken his resolution Has not our Master told us to take up our cross?It was a trouble to him, that they should so earnestly press him to dothat in which he could not gratify them without wronging hisconscience. When we see trouble coming, it becomes us to say, not only,The will of the Lord must be done, and there is no remedy; but, Let thewill of the Lord be done; for his will is his wisdom, and he doeth allaccording to the counsel of it. When a trouble is come, this must allayour griefs, that the will of the Lord is done; when we see it coming,this must silence our fears, that the will of the Lord shall be done;and we ought to say, Amen, let it be done. It is honourable to be anold disciple of Jesus Christ, to have been enabled by the grace of Godto continue long in a course of duty, stedfast in the faith, growingmore and more experienced, to a good old age. And with these olddisciples one would choose to lodge; for the multitude of their yearsshall teach wisdom. Many brethren at Jerusalem received Paul gladly. Wethink, perhaps, that if we had him among us, we should gladly receivehim; but we should not, if, having his doctrine, we do not gladlyreceive that.
Act 21:19-26	<br>Paul ascribed all his success to God, and to God they gave the praise.God had honoured him more than any of the apostles, yet they did notenvy him; but on the contrary, glorified the Lord. They could not domore to encourage Paul to go on cheerfully in his work. James and theelders of the church at Jerusalem, asked Paul to gratify the believingJews, by some compliance with the ceremonial law. They thought it wasprudent in him to conform thus far. It was great weakness to be so fondof the shadows, when the substance was come. The religion Paulpreached, tended not to destroy the law, but to fulfil it. He preachedChrist, the end of the law for righteousness, and repentance and faith,in which we are to make great use of the law. The weakness and evil ofthe human heart strongly appear, when we consider how many, even of thedisciples of Christ, had not due regard to the most eminent ministerthat even lived. Not the excellence of his character, nor the successwith which God blessed his labours, could gain their esteem andaffection, seeing that he did not render the same respect as themselvesto mere ceremonial observances. How watchful should we be againstprejudices! The apostles were not free from blame in all they did; andit would be hard to defend Paul from the charge of giving way too muchin this matter. It is vain to attempt to court the favour of zealots,or bigots to a party. This compliance of Paul did not answer, for thevery thing by which he hoped to pacify the Jews, provoked them, andbrought him into trouble. But the all-wise God overruled both theiradvice and Paul's compliance with it, to serve a better purpose thanwas intended. It was in vain to think of pleasing men who would bepleased with nothing but the rooting out of Christianity. Integrity anduprightness will be more likely to preserve us than insincerecompliances. And it should warn us not to press men to doing what iscontrary to their own judgment to oblige us.
Act 21:27-40	<br>In the temple, where Paul should have been protected as in a place ofsafety, he was violently set upon. They falsely charged him with illdoctrine and ill practice against the Mosaic ceremonies. It is no newthing for those who mean honestly and act regularly, to have thingslaid to their charge which they know not and never thought of. It iscommon for the wise and good to have that charged against them bymalicious people, with which they thought to have obliged them. Godoften makes those a protection to his people, who have no affection tothem, but only have compassion for sufferers, and regard to the publicpeace. And here see what false, mistaken notions of good people andgood ministers, many run away with. But God seasonably interposes forthe safety of his servants, from wicked and unreasonable men; and givesthem opportunities to speak for themselves, to plead for the Redeemer,and to spread abroad his glorious gospel.
Act 22:1-11	<br>The apostle addressed the enraged multitude, in the customary style ofrespect and good-will. Paul relates the history of his early life veryparticularly; he notices that his conversion was wholly the act of God.Condemned sinners are struck blind by the power of darkness, and it isa lasting blindness, like that of the unbelieving Jews. Convincedsinners are struck blind as Paul was, not by darkness, but by light.They are for a time brought to be at a loss within themselves, but itis in order to their being enlightened. A simple relation of the Lord'sdealings with us, in bringing us, from opposing, to profess and promotehis gospel, when delivered in a right spirit and manner, will sometimesmake more impression that laboured speeches, even though it amounts notto the full proof of the truth, such as was shown in the change wroughtin the apostle.
Act 22:12-21	<br>The apostle goes on to relate how he was confirmed in the change he hadmade. The Lord having chosen the sinner, that he should know his will,he is humbled, enlightened, and brought to the knowledge of Christ andhis blessed gospel. Christ is here called that Just One; for he isJesus Christ the righteous. Those whom God has chosen to know his will,must look to Jesus, for by him God has made known his good-will to us.The great gospel privilege, sealed to us by baptism, is the pardon ofsins. Be baptized, and wash away thy sins; that is, receive the comfortof the pardon of thy sins in and through Jesus Christ, and lay hold onhis righteousness for that purpose; and receive power against sin, forthe mortifying of thy corruptions. Be baptized, and rest not in thesign, but make sure of the thing signified, the putting away of thefilth of sin. The great gospel duty, to which by our baptism we arebound, is, to seek for the pardon of our sins in Christ's name, and independence on him and his righteousness. God appoints his labourerstheir day and their place, and it is fit they should follow hisappointment, though it may cross their own will. Providence contrivesbetter for us than we do for ourselves; we must refer ourselves toGod's guidance. If Christ send any one, his Spirit shall go along withhim, and give him to see the fruit of his labours. But nothing canreconcile man's heart to the gospel, except the special grace of God.
Act 22:22-30	<br>The Jews listened to Paul's account of his conversion, but the mentionof his being sent to the Gentiles, was so contrary to all theirnational prejudices, that they would hear no more. Their franticconduct astonished the Roman officer, who supposed that Paul must havecommitted some great crime. Paul pleaded his privilege as a Romancitizen, by which he was exempted from all trials and punishments whichmight force him to confess himself guilty. The manner of his speakingplainly shows what holy security and serenity of mind he enjoyed. AsPaul was a Jew, in low circumstances, the Roman officer questioned howhe obtained so valuable a distinction; but the apostle told him he wasfree born. Let us value that freedom to which all the children of Godare born; which no sum of money, however large, can purchase for thosewho remain unregenerate. This at once put a stop to his trouble. Thusmany are kept from evil practices by the fear of man, who would not beheld back from them by the fear of God. The apostle asks, simply, Is itlawful? He knew that the God whom he served would support him under allsufferings for his name's sake. But if it were not lawful, theapostle's religion directed him, if possible, to avoid it. He nevershrunk from a cross which his Divine Master laid upon his onward road;and he never stept aside out of that road to take one up.
Act 23:1-5	<br>See here the character of an honest man. He sets God before him, andlives as in his sight. He makes conscience of what he says and does,and, according to the best of his knowledge, he keeps from whatever isevil, and cleaves to what is good. He is conscientious in all his wordsand conduct. Those who thus live before God, may, like Paul, haveconfidence both toward God and man. Though the answer of Paul containeda just rebuke and prediction, he seems to have been too angry at thetreatment he received in uttering them. Great men may be told of theirfaults, and public complaints may be made in a proper manner; but thelaw of God requires respect for those in authority.
Act 23:6-11	<br>The Pharisees were correct in the faith of the Jewish church. TheSadducees were no friends to the Scripture or Divine revelation; theydenied a future state; they had neither hope of eternal happiness, nordread of eternal misery. When called in question for his being aChristian, Paul might truly say he was called in question for the hopeof the resurrection of the dead. It was justifiable in him, by thisprofession of his opinion on that disputed point, to draw off thePharisees from persecuting him, and to lead them to protect him fromthis unlawful violence. How easily can God defend his own cause! Thoughthe Jews seemed to be perfectly agreed in their conspiracy againstreligion, yet they were influenced by very different motives. There isno true friendship among the wicked, and in a moment, and with theutmost ease, God can turn their union into open enmity. Divineconsolations stood Paul in the most stead; the chief captain rescuedhim out of the hands of cruel men, but the event he could not tell.Whoever is against us, we need not fear, if the Lord stand by us. It isthe will of Christ, that his servants who are faithful, should bealways cheerful. He might think he should never see Rome; but God tellshim, even in that he should be gratified, since he desired to go thereonly for the honour of Christ, and to do good.
Act 23:12-24	<br>False religious principles, adopted by carnal men, urge on to suchwickedness, as human nature would hardly be supposed capable of. Yetthe Lord readily disappoints the best concerted schemes of iniquity.Paul knew that the Divine providence acts by reasonable and prudentmeans; and that, if he neglected to use the means in his power, hecould not expect God's providence to work on his behalf. He who willnot help himself according to his means and power, has neither reasonnor revelation to assure him that he shall receive help from God.Believing in the Lord, we and ours shall be kept from every evil work,and kept to his kingdom. Heavenly Father, give us by thy Holy Spirit,for Christ's sake, this precious faith.
Act 23:25-35	<br>God has instruments for every work. The natural abilities and moralvirtues of the heathens often have been employed to protect hispersecuted servants. Even the men of the world can discern between theconscientious conduct of upright believers, and the zeal of falseprofessors, though they disregard or understand not their doctrinalprinciples. All hearts are in God's hand, and those are blessed who puttheir trust in him, and commit their ways unto him.
Act 24:1-9	<br>See here the unhappiness of great men, and a great unhappiness it is,to have their services praised beyond measure, and never to befaithfully told of their faults; hereby they are hardened andencouraged in evil, like Felix. God's prophets were charged with beingtroublers of the land, and our Lord Jesus Christ, that he perverted thenation; the very same charges were brought against Paul. The selfishand evil passions of men urge them forward, and the graces and power ofspeech, too often have been used to mislead and prejudice men againstthe truth. How different will the characters of Paul and Felix appearat the day of judgement, from what they are represented in the speechof Tertullus! Let not Christians value the applause, or be troubled atthe revilings of ungodly men, who represent the vilest of the humanrace almost as gods, and the excellent of the earth as pestilences andmovers of sedition.
Act 24:10-21	<br>Paul gives a just account of himself, which clears him from crime, andlikewise shows the true reason of the violence against him. Let usnever be driven from any good way by its having an ill name. It is verycomfortable, in worshipping God, to look to him as the God of ourfathers, and to set up no other rule of faith or practice but theScriptures. This shows there will be a resurrection to a finaljudgment. Prophets and their doctrines were to be tried by theirfruits. Paul's aim was to have a conscience void of offence. His careand endeavour was to abstain from many things, and to abound in theexercises of religion at all times; both towards God. and towards man.If blamed for being more earnest in the things of God than ourneighbours, what is our reply? Do we shrink from the accusation? Howmany in the world would rather be accused of any weakness, nay, even ofwickedness, than of an earnest, fervent feeling of love to the LordJesus Christ, and of devotedness to his service! Can such think that Hewill confess them when he comes in his glory, and before the angels ofGod? If there is any sight pleasing to the God of our salvation, and asight at which the angels rejoice, it is, to behold a devoted followerof the Lord, here upon earth, acknowledging that he is guilty, if it bea crime, of loving the Lord who died for him, with all his heart, andsoul, and mind, and strength. And that he will not in silence see God'sword despised, or hear his name profaned; he will rather risk theridicule and the hatred of the world, than one frown from that graciousBeing whose love is better than life.
Act 24:22-27	<br>The apostle reasoned concerning the nature and obligations ofrighteousness, temperance, and of a judgment to come; thus showing theoppressive judge and his profligate mistress, their need of repentance,forgiveness, and of the grace of the gospel. Justice respects ourconduct in life, particularly in reference to others; temperance, thestate and government of our souls, in reference to God. He who does notexercise himself in these, has neither the form nor the power ofgodliness, and must be overwhelmed with the Divine wrath in the day ofGod's appearing. A prospect of the judgment to come, is enough to makethe stoutest heart to tremble. Felix trembled, but that was all. Manyare startled by the word of God, who are not changed by it. Many fearthe consequences of sin, yet continue in the love and practice of sin.In the affairs of our souls, delays are dangerous. Felix put off thismatter to a more convenient season, but we do not find that the moreconvenient season ever came. Behold now is the accepted time; hear thevoice of the Lord to-day. He was in haste to turn from hearing thetruth. Was any business more urgent than for him to reform his conduct,or more important than the salvation of his soul! Sinners often startup like a man roused from his sleep by a loud noise, but soon sinkagain into their usual drowsiness. Be not deceived by occasionalappearances of religion in ourselves or in others. Above all, let usnot trifle with the word of God. Do we expect that as we advance inlife our hearts will grow softer, or that the influence of the worldwill decline? Are we not at this moment in danger of being lost forever? Now is the day of salvation; tomorrow may be too late.
Act 25:1-12	<br>See how restless malice is. Persecutors deem it a peculiar favour tohave their malice gratified. Preaching Christ, the end of the law, wasno offence against the law. In suffering times the prudence of theLord's people is tried, as well as their patience; they need wisdom. Itbecomes those who are innocent, to insist upon their innocence. Paulwas willing to abide by the rules of the law, and to let that take itscourse. If he deserved death, he would accept the punishment. But ifnone of the things whereof they accused him were true, no man coulddeliver him unto them, with justice. Paul is neither released norcondemned. It is an instance of the slow steps which Providence takes;by which we are often made ashamed, both of our hopes and of our fears,and are kept waiting on God.
Act 25:13-27	<br>Agrippa had the government of Galilee. How many unjust and hastyjudgments the Roman maxim, 
Act 25:16), condemn! This heathen, guidedonly by the light of nature, followed law and custom exactly, yet howmany Christians will not follow the rules of truth, justice, andcharity, in judging their brethren! The questions about God's worship,the way of salvation, and the truths of the gospel, may appear doubtfuland without interest, to worldly men and mere politicians. See howslightly this Roman speaks of Christ, and of the great controversybetween the Jews and the Christians. But the day is at hand when Festusand the whole world will see, that all the concerns of the Roman empirewere but trifles and of no consequence, compared with this question ofChrist's resurrection. Those who have had means of instruction, andhave despised them, will be awfully convinced of their sin and folly.Here was a noble assembly brought together to hear the truths of thegospel, though they only meant to gratify their curiosity by attendingto the defence of a prisoner. Many, even now, attend at the places ofhearing the word of God with "great pomp," and too often with no bettermotive than curiosity. And though ministers do not now stand asprisoners to make a defence for their lives, yet numbers affect to sitin judgment upon them, desirous to make them offenders for a word,rather than to learn from them the truth and will of God, for thesalvation of their souls But the pomp of this appearance was outshoneby the real glory of the poor prisoner at the bar. What was the honourof their fine appearance, compared with that of Paul's wisdom, andgrace, and holiness; his courage and constancy in suffering for Christ!It is no small mercy to have God clear up our righteousness as thelight, and our just dealing as the noon-day; to have nothing certainlaid to our charge. And God makes even the enemies of his people to dothem right.	
Act 26:1-11	<br>Christianity teaches us to give a reason of the hope that is in us, andalso to give honour to whom honour is due, without flattery or fear ofman. Agrippa was well versed in the Scriptures of the Old Testament,therefore could the better judge as to the controversy about Jesusbeing the Messiah. Surely ministers may expect, when they preach thefaith of Christ, to be heard patiently. Paul professes that he stillkept to all the good in which he was first educated and trained up. Seehere what his religion was. He was a moralist, a man of virtue, and hadnot learned the arts of the crafty, covetous Pharisees; he was notchargeable with any open vice and profaneness. He was sound in thefaith. He always had a holy regard for the ancient promise made of Godunto the fathers, and built his hope upon it. The apostle knew verywell that all this would not justify him before God, yet he knew it wasfor his reputation among the Jews, and an argument that he was not sucha man as they represented him to be. Though he counted this but loss,that he might win Christ, yet he mentioned it when it might serve tohonour Christ. See here what Paul's religion is; he has not such zealfor the ceremonial law as he had in his youth; the sacrifices andofferings appointed by that, are done away by the great Sacrifice whichthey typified. Of the ceremonial cleansings he makes no conscience, andthinks the Levitical priesthood is done away in the priesthood ofChrist; but, as to the main principles of his religion, he is aszealous as ever. Christ and heaven, are the two great doctrines of thegospel; that God has given to us eternal life, and this life is in hisSon. These are the matter of the promise made unto the fathers. Thetemple service, or continual course of religious duties, day and night,was kept up as the profession of faith in the promise of eternal life,and in expectation of it. The prospect of eternal life should engage usto be diligent and stedfast in all religious exercises. Yet theSadducees hated Paul for preaching the resurrection; and the other Jewsjoined them, because he testified that Jesus was risen, and was thepromised Redeemer of Israel. Many things are thought to be beyondbelief, only because the infinite nature and perfections of Him thathas revealed, performed, or promised them, are overlooked. Paulacknowledged, that while he continued a Pharisee, he was a bitter enemyto Christianity. This was his character and manner of life in thebeginning of his time; and there was every thing to hinder his being aChristian. Those who have been most strict in their conduct beforeconversion, will afterwards see abundant reason for humblingthemselves, even on account of things which they then thought ought tohave been done.
Act 26:12-23	<br>Paul was made a Christian by Divine power; by a revelation of Christboth to him and in him; when in the full career of his sin. He was madea minister by Divine authority: the same Jesus who appeared to him inthat glorious light, ordered him to preach the gospel to the Gentiles.A world that sits in darkness must be enlightened; those must bebrought to know the things that belong to their everlasting peace, whoare yet ignorant of them. A world that lies in wickedness must besanctified and reformed; it is not enough for them to have their eyesopened, they must have their hearts renewed; not enough to be turnedfrom darkness to light, but they must be turned from the power of Satanunto God. All who are turned from sin to God, are not only pardoned,but have a grant of a rich inheritance. The forgiveness of sins makesway for this. None can be happy who are not holy; and to be saints inheaven we must be first saints on earth. We are made holy, and saved byfaith in Christ; by which we rely upon Christ as the Lord ourRighteousness, and give up ourselves to him as the Lord our Ruler; bythis we receive the remission of sins, the gift of the Holy Ghost, andeternal life. The cross of Christ was a stumbling-block to the Jews,and they were in a rage at Paul's preaching the fulfilling of the OldTestament predictions. Christ should be the first that should rise fromthe dead; the Head or principal One. Also, it was foretold by theprophets, that the Gentiles should be brought to the knowledge of Godby the Messiah; and what in this could the Jews justly be displeasedat? Thus the true convert can give a reason of his hope, and a goodaccount of the change manifest in him. Yet for going about and callingon men thus to repent and to be converted, vast numbers have beenblamed and persecuted.
Act 26:24-32	<br>It becomes us, on all occasions, to speak the words of truth andsoberness, and then we need not be troubled at the unjust censures ofmen. Active and laborious followers of the gospel often have beendespised as dreamers or madmen, for believing such doctrines and suchwonderful facts; and for attesting that the same faith and diligence,and an experience like their own, are necessary to all men, whatevertheir rank, in order to their salvation. But apostles and prophets, andthe Son of God himself, were exposed to this charge; and none need bemoved thereby, when Divine grace has made them wise unto salvation.Agrippa saw a great deal of reason for Christianity. His understandingand judgment were for the time convinced, but his heart was notchanged. And his conduct and temper were widely different from thehumility and spirituality of the gospel. Many are almost persuaded tobe religious, who are not quite persuaded; they are under strongconvictions of their duty, and of the excellence of the ways of God,yet do not pursue their convictions. Paul urged that it was the concernof every one to become a true Christian; that there is grace enough inChrist for all. He expressed his full conviction of the truth of thegospel, the absolute necessity of faith in Christ in order tosalvation. Such salvation from such bondage, the gospel of Christoffers to the Gentiles; to a lost world. Yet it is with much difficultythat any person can be persuaded he needs a work of grace on his heart,like that which was needful for the conversion of the Gentiles. Let usbeware of fatal hesitation in our own conduct; and recollect how farthe being almost persuaded to be a Christian, is from being altogethersuch a one as every true believer is.
Act 27:1-11	<br>It was determined by the counsel of God, before it was determined bythe counsel of Festus, that Paul should go to Rome; for God had workfor him to do there. The course they steered, and the places theytouched at, are here set down. And God here encourages those who sufferfor him, to trust in him; for he can put it into the hearts of those tobefriend them, from whom they least expect it. Sailors must make thebest of the wind: and so must we all in our passage over the ocean ofthis world. When the winds are contrary, yet we must be getting forwardas well as we can. Many who are not driven backward by crossprovidences, do not get forward by favourable providences. And manyreal Christians complain as to the concerns of their souls, that theyhave much ado to keep their ground. Every fair haven is not a safehaven. Many show respect to good ministers, who will not take theiradvice. But the event will convince sinners of the vanity of theirhopes, and the folly of their conduct.
Act 27:12-20	<br>Those who launch forth on the ocean of this world, with a fair gale,know not what storms they may meet with; and therefore must not easilytake it for granted that they have obtained their purpose. Let us neverexpect to be quite safe till we enter heaven. They saw neither sun norstars for many days. Thus melancholy sometimes is the condition of thepeople of God as to their spiritual matters; they walk in darkness, andhave no light. See what the wealth of this world is: though coveted asa blessing, the time may come when it will be a burden; not only tooheavy to be carried safely, but heavy enough to sink him that has it.The children of this world can be prodigal of their goods for thesaving their lives, yet are sparing of them in works of piety andcharity, and in suffering for Christ. Any man will rather makeshipwreck of his goods than of his life; but many rather make shipwreckof faith and a good conscience, than of their goods. The means thesailors used did not succeed; but when sinners give up all hope ofsaving themselves, they are prepared to understand God's word, and totrust in his mercy through Jesus Christ.
Act 27:21-29	<br>They did not hearken to the apostle when he warned them of theirdanger; yet if they acknowledge their folly, and repent of it, he willspeak comfort and relief to them when in danger. Most people bringthemselves into trouble, because they do not know when they are welloff; they come to harm and loss by aiming to mend their condition,often against advice. Observe the solemn profession Paul made ofrelation to God. No storms or tempests can hinder God's favour to hispeople, for he is a Help always at hand. It is a comfort to thefaithful servants of God when in difficulties, that as long as the Lordhas any work for them to do, their lives shall be prolonged. If Paulhad thrust himself needlessly into bad company, he might justly havebeen cast away with them; but God calling him into it, they arepreserved with him. They are given thee; there is no greatersatisfaction to a good man than to know he is a public blessing. Hecomforts them with the same comforts wherewith he himself wascomforted. God is ever faithful, therefore let all who have an interestin his promises be ever cheerful. As, with God, saying and doing arenot two things, believing and enjoying should not be so with us. Hopeis an anchor of the soul, sure and stedfast, entering into that withinthe veil. Let those who are in spiritual darkness hold fast by that,and think not of putting to sea again, but abide by Christ, and waittill the day break, and the shadows flee away.
Act 27:30-38	<br>God, who appointed the end, that they should be saved, appointed themeans, that they should be saved by the help of these shipmen. Duty isours, events are God's; we do not trust God, but tempt him, when we saywe put ourselves under his protection, if we do not use proper means,such as are within our power, for our safety. But how selfish are menin general, often even ready to seek their own safety by thedestruction of others! Happy those who have such a one as Paul in theircompany, who not only had intercourse with Heaven, but was of anenlivening spirit to those about him. The sorrow of the world worksdeath, while joy in God is life and peace in the greatest distressesand dangers. The comfort of God's promises can only be ours bybelieving dependence on him, to fulfil his word to us; and thesalvation he reveals must be waited for in use of the means heappoints. If God has chosen us to salvation, he has also appointed thatwe shall obtain it by repentance, faith, prayer, and perseveringobedience; it is fatal presumption to expect it in any other way. It isan encouragement to people to commit themselves to Christ as theirSaviour, when those who invite them, clearly show that they do sothemselves.
Act 27:39-44	<br>The ship that had weathered the storm in the open sea, where it hadroom, is dashed to pieces when it sticks fast. Thus, if the heart fixesin the world in affection, and cleaving to it, it is lost. Satan'stemptations beat against it, and it is gone; but as long as it keepsabove the world, though tossed with cares and tumults, there is hopefor it. They had the shore in view, yet suffered shipwreck in theharbour; thus we are taught never to be secure. Though there is greatdifficulty in the way of the promised salvation, it shall, withoutfail, be brought to pass. It will come to pass that whatever the trialsand dangers may be, in due time all believers will get safely toheaven. Lord Jesus, thou hast assured us that none of thine shallperish. Thou wilt bring them all safe to the heavenly shore. And what apleasing landing will that be! Thou wilt present them to thy Father,and give thy Holy Spirit full possession of them for ever.
Act 28:1-10	<br>God can make strangers to be friends; friends in distress. Those whoare despised for homely manners, are often more friendly than the morepolished; and the conduct of heathens, or persons called barbarians,condemns many in civilized nations, professing to be Christians. Thepeople thought that Paul was a murderer, and that the viper was sent byDivine justice, to be the avenger of blood. They knew that there is aGod who governs the world, so that things do not come to pass bychance, no, not the smallest event, but all by Divine direction; andthat evil pursues sinners; that there are good works which God willreward, and wicked works which he will punish. Also, that murder is adreadful crime, one which shall not long go unpunished. But theythought all wicked people were punished in this life. Though some aremade examples in this world, to prove that there is a God and aProvidence, yet many are left unpunished, to prove that there is ajudgment to come. They also thought all who were remarkably afflictedin this life were wicked people. Divine revelation sets this matter ina true light. Good men often are greatly afflicted in this life, forthe trial and increase of their faith and patience. Observe Paul'sdeliverance from the danger. And thus in the strength of the grace ofChrist, believers shake off the temptations of Satan, with holyresolution. When we despise the censures and reproaches of men, andlook upon them with holy contempt, having the testimony of ourconsciences for us, then, like Paul, we shake off the viper into thefire. It does us no harm, except we are kept by it from our duty. Godhereby made Paul remarkable among these people, and so made way for thereceiving of the gospel. The Lord raises up friends for his people inevery place whither he leads them, and makes them blessings to those inaffliction.
Act 28:11-16	<br>The common events of travelling are seldom worthy of being told; butthe comfort of communion with the saints, and kindness shown byfriends, deserve particular mention. The Christians at Rome were so farfrom being ashamed of Paul, or afraid of owning him, because he was aprisoner, that they were the more careful to show him respect. He hadgreat comfort in this. And if our friends are kind to us, God puts itinto their hearts, and we must give him the glory. When we see thoseeven in strange places, who bear Christ's name, fear God, and servehim, we should lift up our hearts to heaven in thanksgiving. How manygreat men have made their entry into Rome, crowned and in triumph, whoreally were plagues to the world! But here a good man makes his entryinto Rome, chained as a poor captive, who was a greater blessing to theworld than any other merely a man. Is not this enough to put us forever out of conceit with worldly favour? This may encourage God'sprisoners, that he can give them favour in the eyes of those that carrythem captives. When God does not soon deliver his people out ofbondage, yet makes it easy to them, or them easy under it, they havereason to be thankful.
Act 28:17-22	<br>It was for the honour of Paul that those who examined his case,acquitted him. In his appeal he sought not to accuse his nation, butonly to clear himself. True Christianity settles what is of commonconcern to all mankind, and is not built upon narrow opinions andprivate interests. It aims at no worldly benefit or advantage, but allits gains are spiritual and eternal. It is, and always has been, thelot of Christ's holy religion, to be every where spoken against. Lookthrough every town and village where Christ is exalted as the onlySaviour of mankind, and where the people are called to follow him innewness of life, and we see those who give themselves up to Christ,still called a sect, a party, and reproached. And this is the treatmentthey are sure to receive, so long as there shall continue an ungodlyman upon earth.
Act 28:23-31	<br>Paul persuaded the Jews concerning Jesus. Some were wrought upon by theword, and others hardened; some received the light, and others shuttheir eyes against it. And the same has always been the effect of thegospel. Paul parted with them, observing that the Holy Ghost had welldescribed their state. Let all that hear the gospel, and do not heedit, tremble at their doom; for who shall heal them, if God does not?The Jews had afterwards much reasoning among themselves. Many havegreat reasoning, who do not reason aright. They find fault with oneanother's opinions, yet will not yield to truth. Nor will men'sreasoning among themselves convince them, without the grace of God toopen their understandings. While we mourn on account of such despisers,we should rejoice that the salvation of God is sent to others, who willreceive it; and if we are of that number, we should be thankful to Himwho hath made us to differ. The apostle kept to his principle, to knowand preach nothing but Christ and him crucified. Christians, whentempted from their main business, should bring themselves back withthis question, What does this concern the Lord Jesus? What tendency hasit to bring us to him, and to keep us walking in him? The apostlepreached not himself, but Christ, and he was not ashamed of the gospelof Christ. Though Paul was placed in a very narrow opportunity forbeing useful, he was not disturbed in it. Though it was not a wide doorthat was opened to him, yet no man was suffered to shut it; and to manyit was an effectual door, so that there were saints even in Nero'shousehold, Php 4:22. We learn also from Php 1:13, how God overruledPaul's imprisonment for the furtherance of the gospel. And not theresidents at Rome only, but all the church of Christ, to the presentday, and in the most remote corner of the globe, have abundant reasonto bless God, that during the most mature period of his Christian lifeand experience, he was detained a prisoner. It was from his prison,probably chained hand to hand to the soldier who kept him, that theapostle wrote the epistles to the Ephesians, Philippians, Colossians,and Hebrews; epistles showing, perhaps more than any others, theChristian love with which his heart overflowed, and the Christianexperience with which his soul was filled. The believer of the presenttime may have less of triumph, and less of heavenly joy, than theapostle, but every follower of the same Saviour, is equally sure ofsafety and peace at the last. Let us seek to live more and more in thelove of the Saviour; to labour to glorify Him by every action of ourlives; and we shall assuredly, by his strength, be among the number ofthose who now overcome our enemies; and by his free grace and mercy, behereafter among the blessed company who shall sit with Him upon histhrone, even as He also has overcome, and is sitting on his Father'sthrone, at God's right hand for evermore.
Rom 1:1-7	<br>The doctrine of which the apostle Paul wrote, set forth the fulfilmentof the promises by the prophets. It spoke of the Son of God, even Jesusthe Saviour, the promised Messiah, who came from David as to his humannature, but was also declared to be the Son of God, by the Divine powerwhich raised him from the dead. The Christian profession does notconsist in a notional knowledge or a bare assent, much less in perversedisputings, but in obedience. And all those, and those only, arebrought to obedience of the faith, who are effectually called of JesusChrist. Here is, 1. The privilege of Christians; they are beloved ofGod, and are members of that body which is beloved. 2. The duty ofChristians; to be holy, hereunto are they called, called to be saints.These the apostle saluted, by wishing them grace to sanctify theirsouls, and peace to comfort their hearts, as springing from the freemercy of God, the reconciled Father of all believers, and coming tothem through the Lord Jesus Christ.
Rom 1:8-15	<br>We must show love for our friends, not only by praying for them, but bypraising God for them. As in our purposes, so in our desires, we mustremember to say, If the Lord will, Jas 4:15. Our journeys are madeprosperous or otherwise, according to the will of God. We shouldreadily impart to others what God has trusted to us, rejoicing to makeothers joyful, especially taking pleasure in communing with those whobelieve the same things with us. If redeemed by the blood, andconverted by the grace of the Lord Jesus, we are altogether his; andfor his sake we are debtors to all men, to do all the good we can. Suchservices are our duty.
Rom 1:16,17	<br>In these verses the apostle opens the design of the whole epistle, inwhich he brings forward a charge of sinfulness against all flesh;declares the only method of deliverance from condemnation, by faith inthe mercy of God, through Jesus Christ; and then builds upon it purityof heart, grateful obedience, and earnest desires to improve in allthose Christian graces and tempers, which nothing but a lively faith inChrist can bring forth. God is a just and holy God, and we are guiltysinners. It is necessary that we have a righteousness to appear inbefore him: there is such a righteousness brought in by the Messiah,and made known in the gospel; a gracious method of acceptance,notwithstanding the guilt of our sins. It is the righteousness ofChrist, who is God, coming from a satisfaction of infinite value. Faithis all in all, both in the beginning and progress of Christian life. Itis not from faith to works, as if faith put us into a justified state,and then works kept us in it; but it is all along from faith to faith;it is faith pressing forward, and gaining the victory over unbelief.
Rom 1:18-25	<br>The apostle begins to show that all mankind need the salvation of thegospel, because none could obtain the favour of God, or escape hiswrath by their own works. For no man can plead that he has fulfilledall his obligations to God and to his neighbour; nor can any truly saythat he has fully acted up to the light afforded him. The sinfulness ofman is described as ungodliness against the laws of the first table,and unrighteousness against those of the second. The cause of thatsinfulness is holding the truth in unrighteousness. All, more or less,do what they know to be wrong, and omit what they know to be right, sothat the plea of ignorance cannot be allowed from any. Our Creator'sinvisible power and Godhead are so clearly shown in the works he hasmade, that even idolaters and wicked Gentiles are left without excuse.They foolishly followed idolatry; and rational creatures changed theworship of the glorious Creator, for that of brutes, reptiles, andsenseless images. They wandered from God, till all traces of truereligion must have been lost, had not the revelation of the gospelprevented it. For whatever may be pretended, as to the sufficiency ofman's reason to discover Divine truth and moral obligation, or togovern the practice aright, facts cannot be denied. And these plainlyshow that men have dishonoured God by the most absurd idolatries andsuperstitions; and have degraded themselves by the vilest affectionsand most abominable deeds.
Rom 1:26-32	<br>In the horrid depravity of the heathen, the truth of our Lord's wordswas shown: "Light was come into the world, but men loved darknessrather than light, because their deeds were evil; for he that doethevil hateth the light." The truth was not to their taste. And we allknow how soon a man will contrive, against the strongest evidence, toreason himself out of the belief of what he dislikes. But a man cannotbe brought to greater slavery than to be given up to his own lusts. Asthe Gentiles did not like to keep God in their knowledge, theycommitted crimes wholly against reason and their own welfare. Thenature of man, whether pagan or Christian, is still the same; and thecharges of the apostle apply more or less to the state and character ofmen at all times, till they are brought to full submission to the faithof Christ, and renewed by Divine power. There never yet was a man, whohad not reason to lament his strong corruptions, and his secret disliketo the will of God. Therefore this chapter is a call toself-examination, the end of which should be, a deep conviction of sin,and of the necessity of deliverance from a state of condemnation.
Rom 2:1-16	<br>The Jews thought themselves a holy people, entitled to their privilegesby right, while they were unthankful, rebellious, and unrighteous. Butall who act thus, of every nation, age, and description, must bereminded that the judgment of God will be according to their realcharacter. The case is so plain, that we may appeal to the sinner's ownthoughts. In every wilful sin, there is contempt of the goodness ofGod. And though the branches of man's disobedience are very various,all spring from the same root. But in true repentance, there must behatred of former sinfulness, from a change wrought in the state of themind, which disposes it to choose the good and to refuse the evil. Itshows also a sense of inward wretchedness. Such is the great changewrought in repentance, it is conversion, and is needed by every humanbeing. The ruin of sinners is their walking after a hard and impenitentheart. Their sinful doings are expressed by the strong words,"treasuring up wrath." In the description of the just man, notice thefull demand of the law. It demands that the motives shall be pure, andrejects all actions from earthly ambition or ends. In the descriptionof the unrighteous, contention is held forth as the principle of allevil. The human will is in a state of enmity against God. EvenGentiles, who had not the written law, had that within, which directedthem what to do by the light of nature. Conscience is a witness, andfirst or last will bear witness. As they nature. Conscience is awitness, and first or last will bear witness. As they kept or brokethese natural laws and dictates, their consciences either acquitted orcondemned them. Nothing speaks more terror to sinners, and more comfortto saints, than that Christ shall be the Judge. Secret services shallbe rewarded, secret sins shall be then punished, and brought to light.
Rom 2:17-24	<br>The apostle directs his discourse to the Jews, and shows of what sinsthey were guilty, notwithstanding their profession and vainpretensions. A believing, humble, thankful glorying in God, is the rootand sum of all religion. But proud, vain-glorious boasting in God, andin the outward profession of his name, is the root and sum of allhypocrisy. Spiritual pride is the most dangerous of all kinds of pride.A great evil of the sins professors is, the dishonour done to God andreligion, by their not living according to their profession. Manydespise their more ignorant neighbours who rest in a dead form ofgodliness; yet themselves trust in a form of knowledge, equally void oflife and power, while some glory in the gospel, whose unholy livesdishonour God, and cause his name to be blasphemed.
Rom 2:25-29	<br>No forms, ordinances, or notions can profit, without regeneratinggrace, which will always lead to seeking an interest in therighteousness of God by faith. For he is no more a Christian now, thanhe was really a Jew of old, who is only one outwardly: neither is thatbaptism, which is outward in the flesh: but he is the real Christian,who is inwardly a true believer, with an obedient faith. And the truebaptism is that of the heart, by the washing of regeneration and therenewal of the Holy Ghost; bringing a spiritual frame of mind, and awilling following of truth in its holy ways. Let us pray that we may bemade real Christians, not outwardly, but inwardly; in the heart andspirit, not in the letter; baptized, not with water only, but with theHoly Ghost; and let our praise be, not of men, but of God.
Rom 3:1-8	<br>The law could not save in or from sins, yet it gave the Jews advantagesfor obtaining salvation. Their stated ordinances, education in theknowledge of the true God and his service, and many favours shown tothe children of Abraham, all were means of grace, and doubtless weremade useful to the conversion of many. But especially the Scriptureswere committed to them. Enjoyment of God's word and ordinances, is thechief happiness of a people. But God's promises are made only tobelievers; therefore the unbelief of some, or of many professors,cannot make this faithfulness of no effect. He will fulfil his promisesto his people, and bring his threatened vengeance upon unbelievers.God's judging the world, should for ever silence all doubtings andreflections upon his justice. The wickedness and obstinate unbelief ofthe Jews, proved man's need of the righteousness of God by faith, andalso his justice in punishing for sin. Let us do evil, that good maycome, is oftener in the heart than in the mouth of sinners; for fewthus justify themselves in their wicked ways. The believer knows thatduty belongs to him, and events to God; and that he must not commit anysin, or speak one falsehood, upon the hope, or even assurance, that Godmay thereby glorify himself. If any speak and act thus, theircondemnation is just.
Rom 3:9-18	<br>Here again is shown that all mankind are under the guilt of sin, as aburden; and under the government and dominion of sin, as enslaved toit, to work wickedness. This is made plain by several passages ofScripture from the Old Testament, which describe the corrupt anddepraved state of all men, till grace restrain or change them. Great asour advantages are, these texts describe multitudes who call themselvesChristians. Their principles and conduct prove that there is no fear ofGod before their eyes. And where no fear of God is, no good is to belooked for.
Rom 3:19,20	<br>It is in vain to seek for justification by the works of the law. Allmust plead guilty. Guilty before God, is a dreadful word; but no mancan be justified by a law which condemns him for breaking it. Thecorruption in our nature, will for ever stop any justification by ourown works.
Rom 3:21-26	<br>Must guilty man remain under wrath? Is the wound for ever incurable?No; blessed be God, there is another way laid open for us. This is therighteousness of God; righteousness of his ordaining, and providing,and accepting. It is by that faith which has Jesus Christ for itsobject; an anointed Saviour, so Jesus Christ signifies. Justifyingfaith respects Christ as a Saviour, in all his three anointed offices,as Prophet, Priest, and King; trusting in him, accepting him, andcleaving to him: in all these, Jews and Gentiles are alike welcome toGod through Christ. There is no difference, his righteousness is uponall that believe; not only offered to them, but put upon them as acrown, as a robe. It is free grace, mere mercy; there is nothing in usto deserve such favours. It comes freely unto us, but Christ bought it,and paid the price. And faith has special regard to the blood ofChrist, as that which made the atonement. God, in all this, declareshis righteousness. It is plain that he hates sin, when nothing lessthan the blood of Christ would satisfy for it. And it would not agreewith his justice to demand the debt, when the Surety has paid it, andhe has accepted that payment in full satisfaction.
Rom 3:27-31	<br>God will have the great work of the justification and salvation ofsinners carried on from first to last, so as to shut out boasting. Now,if we were saved by our own works, boasting would not be excluded. Butthe way of justification by faith for ever shuts out boasting. Yetbelievers are not left to be lawless; faith is a law, it is a workinggrace, wherever it is in truth. By faith, not in this matter an act ofobedience, or a good work, but forming the relation between Christ andthe sinner, which renders it proper that the believer should bepardoned and justified for the sake of the Saviour, and that theunbeliever who is not thus united or related to him, should remainunder condemnation. The law is still of use to convince us of what ispast, and to direct us for the future. Though we cannot be saved by itas a covenant, yet we own and submit to it, as a rule in the hand ofthe Mediator.
Rom 4:1-12	<br>To meet the views of the Jews, the apostle first refers to the exampleof Abraham, in whom the Jews gloried as their most renowned forefather.However exalted in various respects, he had nothing to boast in thepresence of God, being saved by grace, through faith, even as others.Without noticing the years which passed before his call, and thefailures at times in his obedience, and even in his faith, it wasexpressly stated in Scripture that "he believed God, and it was countedto him for righteousness," Ge 15:6. From this example it is observed,that if any man could work the full measure required by the law, thereward must be reckoned as a debt, which evidently was not the caseeven of Abraham, seeing faith was reckoned to him for righteousness.When believers are justified by faith, "their faith being counted forrighteousness," their faith does not justify them as a part, small orgreat, of their righteousness; but as the appointed means of unitingthem to Him who has chosen as the name whereby he shall be called, "theLord our Righteousness." Pardoned people are the only blessed people.It clearly appears from the Scripture, that Abraham was justifiedseveral years before his circumcision. It is, therefore, plain thatthis rite was not necessary in order to justification. It was a sign ofthe original corruption of human nature. And it was such a sign as wasalso an outward seal, appointed not only to confirm God's promises tohim and to his seed, and their obligation to be the Lord's, butlikewise to assure him of his being already a real partaker of therighteousness of faith. Thus Abraham was the spiritual forefather ofall believers, who walked after the example of his obedient faith. Theseal of the Holy Spirit in our sanctification, making us new creatures,is the inward evidence of the righteousness of faith.
Rom 4:13-22	<br>The promise was made to Abraham long before the law. It points atChrist, and it refers to the promise, Ge 12:3. In Thee shall allfamilies of the earth be blessed. The law worketh wrath, by showingthat every transgressor is exposed to the Divine displeasure. As Godintended to give men a title to the promised blessings, so he appointedit to be by faith, that it might be wholly of grace, to make it sure toall who were of the like precious faith with Abraham, whether Jews orGentiles, in all ages. The justification and salvation of sinners, thetaking to himself the Gentiles who had not been a people, were agracious calling of things which are not, as though they were; and thisgiving a being to things that were not, proves the almighty power ofGod. The nature and power of Abraham's faith are shown. He believedGod's testimony, and looked for the performance of his promise, firmlyhoping when the case seemed hopeless. It is weakness of faith, thatmakes a man lie poring on the difficulties in the way of a promise.Abraham took it not for a point that would admit of argument or debate.Unbelief is at the bottom of all our staggerings at God's promises. Thestrength of faith appeared in its victory over fears. God honoursfaith; and great faith honours God. It was imputed to him forrighteousness. Faith is a grace that of all others gives glory to God.Faith clearly is the instrument by which we receive the righteousnessof God, the redemption which is by Christ; and that which is theinstrument whereby we take or receive it, cannot be the thing itself,nor can it be the gift thereby taken and received. Abraham's faith didnot justify him by its own merit or value, but as giving him a part inChrist.
Rom 4:23-25	<br>The history of Abraham, and of his justification, was recorded to teachmen of after-ages; those especially to whom the gospel was then madeknown. It is plain, that we are not justified by the merit of our ownworks, but by faith in Jesus Christ and his righteousness; which is thetruth urged in this and the foregoing chapter, as the great spring andfoundation of all comfort. Christ did meritoriously work ourjustification and salvation by his death and passion, but the power andperfection thereof, with respect to us, depend on his resurrection. Byhis death he paid our debt, in his resurrection he received ouracquittance, Isa 53:8. When he was discharged, we, in Him and togetherwith Him, received the discharge from the guilt and punishment of allour sins. This last verse is an abridgement or summary of the wholegospel.
Rom 5:1-5	<br>A blessed change takes place in the sinner's state, when he becomes atrue believer, whatever he has been. Being justified by faith he haspeace with God. The holy, righteous God, cannot be at peace with asinner, while under the guilt of sin. Justification takes away theguilt, and so makes way for peace. This is through our Lord JesusChrist; through him as the great Peace-maker, the Mediator between Godand man. The saints' happy state is a state of grace. Into this gracewe are brought, which teaches that we were not born in this state. Wecould not have got into it of ourselves, but we are led into it, aspardoned offenders. Therein we stand, a posture that denotesperseverance; we stand firm and safe, upheld by the power of the enemy.And those who have hope for the glory of God hereafter, have enough torejoice in now. Tribulation worketh patience, not in and of itself, butthe powerful grace of God working in and with the tribulation. Patientsufferers have most of the Divine consolations, which abound asafflictions abound. It works needful experience of ourselves. This hopewill not disappoint, because it is sealed with the Holy Spirit as aSpirit of love. It is the gracious work of the blessed Spirit to shedabroad the love of God in the hearts of all the saints. A right senseof God's love to us, will make us not ashamed, either of our hope, orof our sufferings for him.
Rom 5:6-11	<br>Christ died for sinners; not only such as were useless, but such aswere guilty and hateful; such that their everlasting destruction wouldbe to the glory of God's justice. Christ died to save us, not in oursins, but from our sins; and we were yet sinners when he died for us.Nay, the carnal mind is not only an enemy to God, but enmity itself,chap. 8:7; Col 1:21. But God designed to deliver from sin, and to worka great change. While the sinful state continues, God loathes thesinner, and the sinner loathes God, Zec 11:8. And that for such asthese Christ should die, is a mystery; no other such an instance oflove is known, so that it may well be the employment of eternity toadore and wonder at it. Again; what idea had the apostle when hesupposed the case of some one dying for a righteous man? And yet heonly put it as a thing that might be. Was it not the undergoing thissuffering, that the person intended to be benefitted might be releasedtherefrom? But from what are believers in Christ released by his death?Not from bodily death; for that they all do and must endure. The evil,from which the deliverance could be effected only in this astonishingmanner, must be more dreadful than natural death. There is no evil, towhich the argument can be applied, except that which the apostleactually affirms, sin, and wrath, the punishment of sin, determined bythe unerring justice of God. And if, by Divine grace, they were thusbrought to repent, and to believe in Christ, and thus were justified bythe price of his bloodshedding, and by faith in that atonement, muchmore through Him who died for them and rose again, would they be keptfrom falling under the power of sin and Satan, or departing finallyfrom him. The living Lord of all, will complete the purpose of hisdying love, by saving all true believers to the uttermost. Having sucha pledge of salvation in the love of God through Christ, the apostledeclared that believers not only rejoiced in the hope of heaven, andeven in their tribulations for Christ's sake, but they gloried in Godalso, as their unchangeable Friend and all-sufficient Portion, throughChrist only.
Rom 5:12-14	<br>The design of what follows is plain. It is to exalt our viewsrespecting the blessings Christ has procured for us, by comparing themwith the evil which followed upon the fall of our first father; and byshowing that these blessings not only extend to the removal of theseevils, but far beyond. Adam sinning, his nature became guilty andcorrupted, and so came to his children. Thus in him all have sinned.And death is by sin; for death is the wages of sin. Then entered allthat misery which is the due desert of sin; temporal, spiritual,eternal death. If Adam had not sinned, he had not died; but a sentenceof death was passed, as upon a criminal; it passed through all men, asan infectious disease that none escape. In proof of our union withAdam, and our part in his first transgression, observe, that sinprevailed in the world, for many ages before the giving of the law byMoses. And death reigned in that long time, not only over adults whowilfully sinned, but also over multitudes of infants, which shows thatthey had fallen in Adam under condemnation, and that the sin of Adamextended to all his posterity. He was a figure or type of Him that wasto come as Surety of a new covenant, for all who are related to Him.
Rom 5:15-19	<br>Through one man's offence, all mankind are exposed to eternalcondemnation. But the grace and mercy of God, and the free gift ofrighteousness and salvation, are through Jesus Christ, as man: yet theLord from heaven has brought the multitude of believers into a moresafe and exalted state than that from which they fell in Adam. Thisfree gift did not place them anew in a state of trial, but fixed themin a state of justification, as Adam would have been placed, had hestood. Notwithstanding the differences, there is a striking similarity.As by the offence of one, sin and death prevailed to the condemnationof all men, so by the righteousness of one, grace prevailed to thejustification of all related to Christ by faith. Through the grace ofGod, the gift by grace has abounded to many through Christ; yetmultitudes choose to remain under the dominion of sin and death, ratherthan to apply for the blessings of the reign of grace. But Christ willin nowise cast out any who are willing to come to him.
Rom 5:20,21	<br>By Christ and his righteousness, we have more and greater privilegesthan we lost by the offence of Adam. The moral law showed that manythoughts, tempers, words, and actions, were sinful, thus transgressionswere multiplied. Not making sin to abound the more, but discovering thesinfulness of it, even as the letting in a clearer light into a room,discovers the dust and filth which were there before, but were notseen. The sin of Adam, and the effect of corruption in us, are theabounding of that offence which appeared on the entrance of the law.And the terrors of the law make gospel comforts the more sweet. ThusGod the Holy Spirit has, by the blessed apostle, delivered to us a mostimportant truth, full of consolation, suited to our need as sinners.Whatever one may have above another, every man is a sinner against God,stands condemned by the law, and needs pardon. A righteousness that isto justify cannot be made up of a mixture of sin and holiness. Therecan be no title to an eternal reward without a pure and spotlessrighteousness: let us look for it, even to the righteousness of Christ.
Rom 6:1,2	<br>The apostle is very full in pressing the necessity of holiness. He doesnot explain away the free grace of the gospel, but he shows thatconnexion between justification and holiness are inseparable. Let thethought be abhorred, of continuing in sin that grace may abound. Truebelievers are dead to sin, therefore they ought not to follow it. Noman can at the same time be both dead and alive. He is a fool who,desiring to be dead unto sin, thinks he may live in it.
Rom 6:3-10	<br>Baptism teaches the necessity of dying to sin, and being as it wereburied from all ungodly and unholy pursuits, and of rising to walk withGod in newness of life. Unholy professors may have had the outward signof a death unto sin, and a new birth unto righteousness, but they neverpassed from the family of Satan to that of God. The corrupt nature,called the old man, because derived from our first father Adam, iscrucified with Christ, in every true believer, by the grace derivedfrom the cross. It is weakened and in a dying state, though it yetstruggles for life, and even for victory. But the whole body of sin,whatever is not according to the holy law of God, must be done away, sothat the believer may no more be the slave of sin, but live to God, andfind happiness in his service.
Rom 6:11-15	<br>The strongest motives against sin, and to enforce holiness, are herestated. Being made free from the reign of sin, alive unto God, andhaving the prospect of eternal life, it becomes believers to be greatlyconcerned to advance thereto. But, as unholy lusts are not quite rootedout in this life, it must be the care of the Christian to resist theirmotions, earnestly striving, that, through Divine grace, they may notprevail in this mortal state. Let the thought that this state will soonbe at an end, encourage the true Christian, as to the motions of lusts,which so often perplex and distress him. Let us present all our powersto God, as weapons or tools ready for the warfare, and work ofrighteousness, in his service. There is strength in the covenant ofgrace for us. Sin shall not have dominion. God's promises to us aremore powerful and effectual for mortifying sin, than our promises toGod. Sin may struggle in a real believer, and create him a great dealof trouble, but it shall not have dominion; it may vex him, but itshall not rule over him. Shall any take occasion from this encouragingdoctrine to allow themselves in the practice of any sin? Far be suchabominable thoughts, so contrary to the perfections of God, and thedesign of his gospel, so opposed to being under grace. What can be astronger motive against sin than the love of Christ? Shall we sinagainst so much goodness, and such love?
Rom 6:16-20	<br>Every man is the servant of the master to whose commands he yieldshimself; whether it be the sinful dispositions of his heart, in actionswhich lead to death, or the new and spiritual obedience implanted byregeneration. The apostle rejoiced now they obeyed from the heart thegospel, into which they were delivered as into a mould. As the samemetal becomes a new vessel, when melted and recast in another mould, sothe believer has become a new creature. And there is great differencein the liberty of mind and spirit, so opposite to the state of slavery,which the true Christian has in the service of his rightful Lord, whomhe is enabled to consider as his Father, and himself as his son andheir, by the adoption of grace. The dominion of sin consists in beingwillingly slaves thereto, not in being harassed by it as a hated power,struggling for victory. Those who now are the servants of God, oncewere the slaves of sin.
Rom 6:21-23	<br>The pleasure and profit of sin do not deserve to be called fruit.Sinners are but ploughing iniquity, sowing vanity, and reaping thesame. Shame came into the world with sin, and is still the certaineffect of it. The end of sin is death. Though the way may seem pleasantand inviting, yet it will be bitterness in the latter end. From thiscondemnation the believer is set at liberty, when made free from sin.If the fruit is unto holiness, if there is an active principle of trueand growing grace, the end will be everlasting life; a very happy end!Though the way is up-hill, though it is narrow, thorny, and beset, yeteverlasting life at the end of it is sure. The gift of God is eternallife. And this gift is through Jesus Christ our Lord. Christ purchasedit, prepared it, prepares us for it, preserves us to it; he is the Allin all in our salvation.
Rom 7:1-6	<br>So long as a man continues under the law as a covenant, and seeksjustification by his own obedience, he continues the slave of sin insome form. Nothing but the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus, can make anysinner free from the law of sin and death. Believers are delivered fromthat power of the law, which condemns for the sins committed by them.And they are delivered from that power of the law which stirs up andprovokes the sin that dwells in them. Understand this not of the law asa rule, but as a covenant of works. In profession and privilege, we areunder a covenant of grace, and not under a covenant of works; under thegospel of Christ, not under the law of Moses. The difference is spokenof under the similitude or figure of being married to a new husband.The second marriage is to Christ. By death we are freed from obligationto the law as a covenant, as the wife is from her vows to her husband.In our believing powerfully and effectually, we are dead to the law,and have no more to do with it than the dead servant, who is freed fromhis master, has to do with his master's yoke. The day of our believing,is the day of being united to the Lord Jesus. We enter upon a life ofdependence on him, and duty to him. Good works are from union withChrist; as the fruitfulness of the vine is the product of its beingunited to its roots; there is no fruit to God, till we are united toChrist. The law, and the greatest efforts of one under the law, stillin the flesh, under the power of corrupt principles, cannot set theheart right with regard to the love of God, overcome worldly lusts, orgive truth and sincerity in the inward parts, or any thing that comesby the special sanctifying influences of the Holy Spirit. Nothing morethan a formal obedience to the outward letter of any precept, can beperformed by us, without the renewing, new-creating grace of the newcovenant.
Rom 7:7-13	<br>There is no way of coming to that knowledge of sin, which is necessaryto repentance, and therefore to peace and pardon, but by trying ourhearts and lives by the law. In his own case the apostle would not haveknown the sinfulness of his thoughts, motives, and actions, but by thelaw. That perfect standard showed how wrong his heart and life were,proving his sins to be more numerous than he had before thought, but itdid not contain any provision of mercy or grace for his relief. He isignorant of human nature and the perverseness of his own heart, whodoes not perceive in himself a readiness to fancy there is somethingdesirable in what is out of reach. We may perceive this in ourchildren, though self-love makes us blind to it in ourselves. The morehumble and spiritual any Christian is, the more clearly will heperceive that the apostle describes the true believer, from his firstconvictions of sin to his greatest progress in grace, during thispresent imperfect state. St. Paul was once a Pharisee, ignorant of thespirituality of the law, having some correctness of character, withoutknowing his inward depravity. When the commandment came to hisconscience by the convictions of the Holy Spirit, and he saw what itdemanded, he found his sinful mind rise against it. He felt at the sametime the evil of sin, his own sinful state, that he was unable tofulfil the law, and was like a criminal when condemned. But though theevil principle in the human heart produces sinful motions, and the moreby taking occasion of the commandment; yet the law is holy, and thecommandment holy, just, and good. It is not favourable to sin, which itpursues into the heart, and discovers and reproves in the inwardmotions thereof. Nothing is so good but a corrupt and vicious naturewill pervert it. The same heat that softens wax, hardens clay. Food ormedicine when taken wrong, may cause death, though its nature is tonourish or to heal. The law may cause death through man's depravity,but sin is the poison that brings death. Not the law, but sindiscovered by the law, was made death to the apostle. The ruinousnature of sin, and the sinfulness of the human heart, are here clearlyshown.
Rom 7:14-17	<br>Compared with the holy rule of conduct in the law of God, the apostlefound himself so very far short of perfection, that he seemed to becarnal; like a man who is sold against his will to a hated master, fromwhom he cannot set himself at liberty. A real Christian unwillinglyserves this hated master, yet cannot shake off the galling chain, tillhis powerful and gracious Friend above, rescues him. The remaining evilof his heart is a real and humbling hinderance to his serving God asangels do and the spirits of just made perfect. This strong languagewas the result of St. Paul's great advance in holiness, and the depthof his self-abasement and hatred of sin. If we do not understand thislanguage, it is because we are so far beneath him in holiness,knowledge of the spirituality of God's law, and the evil of our ownhearts, and hatred of moral evil. And many believers have adopted theapostle's language, showing that it is suitable to their deep feelingsof abhorrence of sin, and self-abasement. The apostle enlarges on theconflict he daily maintained with the remainder of his originaldepravity. He was frequently led into tempers, words, or actions, whichhe did not approve or allow in his renewed judgement and affections. Bydistinguishing his real self, his spiritual part, from the self, orflesh, in which sin dwelt, and by observing that the evil actions weredone, not by him, but by sin dwelling in him, the apostle did not meanthat men are not accountable for their sins, but he teaches the evil oftheir sins, by showing that they are all done against reason andconscience. Sin dwelling in a man, does not prove its ruling, or havingdominion over him. If a man dwells in a city, or in a country, still hemay not rule there.
Rom 7:18-22	<br>The more pure and holy the heart is, it will have the more quickfeeling as to the sin that remains in it. The believer sees more of thebeauty of holiness and the excellence of the law. His earnest desiresto obey, increase as he grows in grace. But the whole good on which hiswill is fully bent, he does not do; sin ever springing up in him,through remaining corruption, he often does evil, though against thefixed determination of his will. The motions of sin within grieved theapostle. If by the striving of the flesh against the Spirit, was meantthat he could not do or perform as the Spirit suggested, so also, bythe effectual opposition of the Spirit, he could not do what the fleshprompted him to do. How different this case from that of those who makethemselves easy with regard to the inward motions of the fleshprompting them to evil; who, against the light and warning ofconscience, go on, even in outward practice, to do evil, and thus, withforethought, go on in the road to perdition! For as the believer isunder grace, and his will is for the way of holiness, he sincerelydelights in the law of God, and in the holiness which it demands,according to his inward man; that new man in him, which after God iscreated in true holiness.
Rom 7:23-25	<br>This passage does not represent the apostle as one that walked afterthe flesh, but as one that had it greatly at heart, not to walk so. Andif there are those who abuse this passage, as they also do the otherScriptures, to their own destruction, yet serious Christians find causeto bless God for having thus provided for their support and comfort. Weare not, because of the abuse of such as are blinded by their ownlusts, to find fault with the scripture, or any just and well warrantedinterpretation of it. And no man who is not engaged in this conflict,can clearly understand the meaning of these words, or rightly judgeconcerning this painful conflict, which led the apostle to bemoanhimself as a wretched man, constrained to what he abhorred. He couldnot deliver himself; and this made him the more fervently thank God forthe way of salvation revealed through Jesus Christ, which promised him,in the end, deliverance from this enemy. So then, says he, I myself,with my mind, my prevailing judgement, affections, and purposes, as aregenerate man, by Divine grace, serve and obey the law of God; butwith the flesh, the carnal nature, the remains of depravity, I servethe law of sin, which wars against the law of my mind. Not serving itso as to live in it, or to allow it, but as unable to free himself fromit, even in his very best state, and needing to look for help anddeliverance out of himself. It is evident that he thanks God forChrist, as our deliverer, as our atonement and righteousness inhimself, and not because of any holiness wrought in us. He knew of nosuch salvation, and disowned any such title to it. He was willing toact in all points agreeable to the law, in his mind and conscience, butwas hindered by indwelling sin, and never attained the perfection thelaw requires. What can be deliverance for a man always sinful, but thefree grace of God, as offered in Christ Jesus? The power of Divinegrace, and of the Holy Spirit, could root out sin from our hearts evenin this life, if Divine wisdom had not otherwise thought fit. But it issuffered, that Christians might constantly feel, and understandthoroughly, the wretched state from which Divine grace saves them;might be kept from trusting in themselves; and might ever hold alltheir consolation and hope, from the rich and free grace of God inChrist.
Rom 8:1-9	<br>Believers may be chastened of the Lord, but will not be condemned withthe world. By their union with Christ through faith, they are thussecured. What is the principle of their walk; the flesh or the Spirit,the old or the new nature, corruption or grace? For which of these dowe make provision, by which are we governed? The unrenewed will isunable to keep any commandment fully. And the law, besides outwardduties, requires inward obedience. God showed abhorrence of sin by thesufferings of his Son in the flesh, that the believer's person might bepardoned and justified. Thus satisfaction was made to Divine justice,and the way of salvation opened for the sinner. By the Spirit the lawof love is written upon the heart, and though the righteousness of thelaw is not fulfilled by us, yet, blessed be God, it is fulfilled in us;there is that in all true believers, which answers the intention of thelaw. The favour of God, the welfare of the soul, the concerns ofeternity, are the things of the Spirit, which those that are after theSpirit do mind. Which way do our thoughts move with most pleasure?Which way go our plans and contrivances? Are we most wise for theworld, or for our souls? Those that live in pleasure are dead, 1Ti 5:6.A sanctified soul is a living soul; and that life is peace. The carnalmind is not only an enemy to God, but enmity itself. The carnal manmay, by the power of Divine grace, be made subject to the law of God,but the carnal mind never can; that must be broken and driven out. Wemay know our real state and character by inquiring whether we have theSpirit of God and Christ, or not, ver. 9. Ye are not in the flesh, butin the Spirit. Having the Spirit of Christ, means having a turn of mindin some degree like the mind that was in Christ Jesus, and is to beshown by a life and conversation suitable to his precepts and example.
Rom 8:10-17	<br>If the Spirit be in us, Christ is in us. He dwells in the heart byfaith. Grace in the soul is its new nature; the soul is alive to God,and has begun its holy happiness which shall endure for ever. Therighteousness of Christ imputed, secures the soul, the better part,from death. From hence we see how much it is our duty to walk, notafter the flesh, but after the Spirit. If any habitually live accordingto corrupt lustings, they will certainly perish in their sins, whateverthey profess. And what can a worldly life present, worthy for a momentto be put against this noble prize of our high calling? Let us then, bythe Spirit, endeavour more and more to mortify the flesh. Regenerationby the Holy Spirit brings a new and Divine life to the soul, though ina feeble state. And the sons of God have the Spirit to work in them thedisposition of children; they have not the spirit of bondage, which theOld Testament church was under, through the darkness of thatdispensation. The Spirit of adoption was not then plentifully pouredout. Also it refers to that spirit of bondage, under which many saintswere at their conversion. Many speak peace to themselves, to whom Goddoes not speak peace. But those who are sanctified, have God's Spiritwitnessing with their spirits, in and by his speaking peace to thesoul. Though we may now seem to be losers for Christ, we shall not, wecannot, be losers by him in the end.
Rom 8:18-25	<br>The sufferings of the saints strike no deeper than the things of time,last no longer than the present time, are light afflictions, and butfor a moment. How vastly different are the sentence of the word and thesentiment of the world, concerning the sufferings of this present time!Indeed the whole creation seems to wait with earnest expectation forthe period when the children of God shall be manifested in the gloryprepared for them. There is an impurity, deformity, and infirmity,which has come upon the creature by the fall of man. There is an enmityof one creature to another. And they are used, or abused rather, by menas instruments of sin. Yet this deplorable state of the creation is inhope. God will deliver it from thus being held in bondage to man'sdepravity. The miseries of the human race, through their own and eachother's wickedness, declare that the world is not always to continue asit is. Our having received the first-fruits of the Spirit, quickens ourdesires, encourages our hopes, and raises our expectations. Sin hasbeen, and is, the guilty cause of all the suffering that exists in thecreation of God. It has brought on the woes of earth; it has kindledthe flames of hell. As to man, not a tear has been shed, not a groanhas been uttered, not a pang has been felt, in body or mind, that hasnot come from sin. This is not all; sin is to be looked at as itaffects the glory of God. Of this how fearfully regardless are the bulkof mankind! Believers have been brought into a state of safety; buttheir comfort consists rather in hope than in enjoyment. From this hopethey cannot be turned by the vain expectation of finding satisfactionin the things of time and sense. We need patience, our way is rough andlong; but He that shall come, will come, though he seems to tarry.
Rom 8:26,27	<br>Though the infirmities of Christians are many and great, so that theywould be overpowered if left to themselves, yet the Holy Spiritsupports them. The Spirit, as an enlightening Spirit, teaches us whatto pray for; as a sanctifying Spirit, works and stirs up prayinggraces; as a comforting Spirit, silences our fears, and helps us overall discouragements. The Holy Spirit is the spring of all desirestoward God, which are often more than words can utter. The Spirit whosearches the hearts, can perceive the mind and will of the spirit, therenewed mind, and advocates his cause. The Spirit makes intercession toGod, and the enemy prevails not.
Rom 8:28-31	<br>That is good for the saints which does their souls good. Everyprovidence tends to the spiritual good of those that love God; inbreaking them off from sin, bringing them nearer to God, weaning themfrom the world, and fitting them for heaven. When the saints act out ofcharacter, corrections will be employed to bring them back again. Andhere is the order of the causes of our salvation, a golden chain, onewhich cannot be broken. 1. Whom he did foreknow, he also didpredestinate to be conformed to the image of his Son. All that Goddesigned for glory and happiness as the end, he decreed to grace andholiness as the way. The whole human race deserved destruction; but forreasons not perfectly known to us, God determined to recover some byregeneration and the power of his grace. He predestinated, or beforedecreed, that they should be conformed to the image of his Son. In thislife they are in part renewed, and walk in his steps. 2. Whom he didpredestinate, them he also called. It is an effectual call, from selfand earth to God, and Christ, and heaven, as our end; from sin andvanity to grace and holiness, as our way. This is the gospel call. Thelove of God, ruling in the hearts of those who once were enemies tohim, proves that they have been called according to his purpose. 3.Whom he called, them he also justified. None are thus justified butthose that are effectually called. Those who stand out against thegospel call, abide under guilt and wrath. 4. Whom he justified, them healso glorified. The power of corruption being broken in effectualcalling, and the guilt of sin removed in justification, nothing cancome between that soul and glory. This encourages our faith and hope;for, as for God, his way, his work, is perfect. The apostle speaks asone amazed, and swallowed up in admiration, wondering at the height anddepth, and length and breadth, of the love of Christ, which passethknowledge. The more we know of other things, the less we wonder; butthe further we are led into gospel mysteries, the more we are affectedby them. While God is for us, and we keep in his love, we may with holyboldness defy all the powers of darkness.
Rom 8:32-39	<br>All things whatever, in heaven and earth, are not so great a display ofGod's free love, as the gift of his coequal Son to be the atonement onthe cross for the sin of man; and all the rest follows upon union withhim, and interest in him. All things, all which can be the causes ormeans of any real good to the faithful Christian. He that has prepareda crown and a kingdom for us, will give us what we need in the way toit. Men may justify themselves, though the accusations are in fullforce against them; but if God justifies, that answers all. By Christwe are thus secured. By the merit of his death he paid our debt. Yea,rather that is risen again. This is convincing evidence that Divinejustice was satisfied. We have such a Friend at the right hand of God;all power is given to him. He is there, making intercession. Believer!does your soul say within you, Oh that he were mine! and oh that I werehis; that I could please him and live to him! Then do not toss yourspirit and perplex your thoughts in fruitless, endless doubtings, butas you are convinced of ungodliness, believe on Him who justifies theungodly. You are condemned, yet Christ is dead and risen. Flee to Himas such. God having manifested his love in giving his own Son for us,can we think that any thing should turn aside or do away that love?Troubles neither cause nor show any abatement of his love. Whateverbelievers may be separated from, enough remains. None can take Christfrom the believer: none can take the believer from Him; and that isenough. All other hazards signify nothing. Alas, poor sinners! thoughyou abound with the possessions of this world, what vain things arethey! Can you say of any of them, Who shall separate us? You may beremoved from pleasant dwellings, and friends, and estates. You may evenlive to see and seek your parting. At last you must part, for you mustdie. Then farewell, all this world accounts most valuable. And whathast thou left, poor soul, who hast not Christ, but that which thouwouldest gladly part with, and canst not; the condemning guilt of allthy sins! But the soul that is in Christ, when other things are pulledaway, cleaves to Christ, and these separations pain him not. Yea, whendeath comes, that breaks all other unions, even that of the soul andbody, it carries the believer's soul into the nearest union with itsbeloved Lord Jesus, and the full enjoyment of him for ever.
Rom 9:1-5	<br>Being about to discuss the rejection of the Jews and the calling of theGentiles, and to show that the whole agrees with the sovereign electinglove of God, the apostle expresses strongly his affection for hispeople. He solemnly appeals to Christ; and his conscience, enlightenedand directed by the Holy Spirit, bore witness to his sincerity. Hewould submit to be treated as "accursed," to be disgraced, crucified;and even for a time be in the deepest horror and distress; if he couldrescue his nation from the destruction about to come upon them fortheir obstinate unbelief. To be insensible to the eternal condition ofour fellow-creatures, is contrary both to the love required by the law,and the mercy of the gospel. They had long been professed worshippersof Jehovah. The law, and the national covenant which was groundedthereon, belonged to them. The temple worship was typical of salvationby the Messiah, and the means of communion with God. All the promisesconcerning Christ and his salvation were given to them. He is not onlyover all, as Mediator, but he is God blessed for ever.
Rom 9:6-13	<br>The rejection of the Jews by the gospel dispensation, did not breakGod's promise to the patriarchs. The promises and threatenings shall befulfilled. Grace does not run in the blood; nor are saving benefitsalways found with outward church privileges. Not only some of Abraham'sseed were chosen, and others not, but God therein wrought according tothe counsel of his own will. God foresaw both Esau and Jacob as born insin, by nature children of wrath even as others. If left to themselvesthey would have continued in sin through life; but for wise and holyreasons, not made known to us, he purposed to change Jacob's heart, andto leave Esau to his perverseness. This instance of Esau and Jacobthrows light upon the Divine conduct to the fallen race of man. Thewhole Scripture shows the difference between the professed Christianand the real believer. Outward privileges are bestowed on many who arenot the children of God. There is, however, full encouragement todiligent use of the means of grace which God has appointed.
Rom 9:14-24	<br>Whatever God does, must be just. Wherein the holy, happy people of Goddiffer from others, God's grace alone makes them differ. In thispreventing, effectual, distinguishing grace, he acts as a benefactor,whose grace is his own. None have deserved it; so that those who aresaved, must thank God only; and those who perish, must blame themselvesonly, Hos 13:9. God is bound no further than he has been pleased tobind himself by his own covenant and promise, which is his revealedwill. And this is, that he will receive, and not cast out, those thatcome to Christ; but the drawing of souls in order to that coming, is ananticipating, distinguishing favour to whom he will. Why does he yetfind fault? This is not an objection to be made by the creature againsthis Creator, by man against God. The truth, as it is in Jesus, abasesman as nothing, as less than nothing, and advances God as sovereignLord of all. Who art thou that art so foolish, so feeble, so unable tojudge the Divine counsels? It becomes us to submit to him, not to replyagainst him. Would not men allow the infinite God the same sovereignright to manage the affairs of the creation, as the potter exercises indisposing of his clay, when of the same lump he makes one vessel to amore honourable, and one to a meaner use? God could do no wrong,however it might appear to men. God will make it appear that he hatessin. Also, he formed vessels filled with mercy. Sanctification is thepreparation of the soul for glory. This is God's work. Sinners fitthemselves for hell, but it is God who prepares saints for heaven; andall whom God designs for heaven hereafter, he fits for heaven now.Would we know who these vessels of mercy are? Those whom God hascalled; and these not of the Jews only, but of the Gentiles. Surelythere can be no unrighteousness in any of these Divine dispensations.Nor in God's exercising long-suffering, patience, and forbearancetowards sinners under increasing guilt, before he brings utterdestruction upon them. The fault is in the hardened sinner himself. Asto all who love and fear God, however such truths appear beyond theirreason to fathom, yet they should keep silence before him. It is theLord alone who made us to differ; we should adore his pardoning mercyand new-creating grace, and give diligence to make our calling andelection sure.
Rom 9:25-29	<br>The rejecting of the Jews, and the taking in the Gentiles, wereforetold in the Old Testament. It tends very much to the clearing of atruth, to observe how the Scripture is fulfilled in it. It is a wonderof Divine power and mercy that there are any saved: for even those leftto be a seed, if God had dealt with them according to their sins, hadperished with the rest. This great truth this Scripture teaches us.Even among the vast number of professing Christians it is to be fearedthat only a remnant will be saved.
Rom 9:30-33	<br>The Gentiles knew not their guilt and misery, therefore were notcareful to procure a remedy. Yet they attained to righteousness byfaith. Not by becoming proselytes to the Jewish religion, andsubmitting to the ceremonial law; but by embracing Christ, andbelieving in him, and submitting to the gospel. The Jews talked much ofjustification and holiness, and seemed very ambitious to be thefavourites of God. They sought, but not in the right way, not in thehumbling way, not in the appointed way. Not by faith, not by embracingChrist, depending upon Christ, and submitting to the gospel. Theyexpected justification by observing the precepts and ceremonies of thelaw of Moses. The unbelieving Jews had a fair offer of righteousness,life, and salvation, made them upon gospel terms, which they did notlike, and would not accept. Have we sought to know how we may bejustified before God, seeking that blessing in the way here pointedout, by faith in Christ, as the Lord our Righteousness? Then we shallnot be ashamed in that awful day, when all refuges of lies shall beswept away, and the Divine wrath shall overflow every hiding-place butthat which God hath prepared in his own Son.
Rom 10:1-4	<br>The Jews built on a false foundation, and refused to come to Christ forfree salvation by faith, and numbers in every age do the same invarious ways. The strictness of the law showed men their need ofsalvation by grace, through faith. And the ceremonies shadowed forthChrist as fulfilling the righteousness, and bearing the curse of thelaw. So that even under the law, all who were justified before God,obtained that blessing by faith, whereby they were made partakers ofthe perfect righteousness of the promised Redeemer. The law is notdestroyed, nor the intention of the Lawgiver disappointed; but fullsatisfaction being made by the death of Christ for our breach of thelaw, the end is gained. That is, Christ has fulfilled the whole law,therefore whoever believeth in him, is counted just before God, as muchas though he had fulfilled the whole law himself. Sinners never couldgo on in vain fancies of their own righteousness, if they knew thejustice of God as a Governor, or his righteousness as a Saviour.
Rom 10:5-11	<br>The self-condemned sinner need not perplex himself how thisrighteousness may be found. When we speak of looking upon Christ, andreceiving, and feeding upon him, it is not Christ in heaven, nor Christin the deep, that we mean; but Christ in the promise, Christ offered inthe word. Justification by faith in Christ is a plain doctrine. It isbrought before the mind and heart of every one, thus leaving himwithout excuse for unbelief. If a man confessed faith in Jesus, as theLord and Saviour of lost sinners, and really believed in his heart thatGod had raised him from the dead, thus showing that he had accepted theatonement, he should be saved by the righteousness of Christ, imputedto him through faith. But no faith is justifying which is not powerfulin sanctifying the heart, and regulating all its affections by the loveof Christ. We must devote and give up to God our souls and our bodies:our souls in believing with the heart, and our bodies in confessingwith the mouth. The believer shall never have cause to repent hisconfident trust in the Lord Jesus. Of such faith no sinner shall beashamed before God; and he ought to glory in it before men.
Rom 10:12-17	<br>There is not one God to the Jews, more kind, and another to theGentiles, who is less kind; the Lord is a Father to all men. Thepromise is the same to all, who call on the name of the Lord Jesus asthe Son of God, as God manifest in the flesh. All believers thus callupon the Lord Jesus, and none else will do so humbly or sincerely. Buthow should any call on the Lord Jesus, the Divine Saviour, who had notheard of him? And what is the life of a Christian but a life of prayer?It shows that we feel our dependence on him, and are ready to give upourselves to him, and have a believing expectation of our all from him.It was necessary that the gospel should be preached to the Gentiles.Somebody must show them what they are to believe. How welcome thegospel ought to be to those to whom it was preached! The gospel isgiven, not only to be known and believed, but to be obeyed. It is not asystem of notions, but a rule of practice. The beginning, progress, andstrength of faith is by hearing. But it is only hearing the word, asthe word of God that will strengthen faith.
Rom 10:18-21	<br>Did not the Jews know that the Gentiles were to be called in? Theymight have known it from Moses and Isaiah. Isaiah speaks plainly of thegrace and favour of God, as going before in the receiving of theGentiles. Was not this our own case? Did not God begin in love, andmake himself known to us when we did not ask after him? The patience ofGod towards provoking sinners is wonderful. The time of God's patienceis called a day, light as day, and fit for work and business; butlimited as a day, and there is a night at the end of it. God's patiencemakes man's disobedience worse, and renders that the more sinful. Wemay wonder at the mercy of God, that his goodness is not overcome byman's badness; we may wonder at the wickedness of man, that his badnessis not overcome by God's goodness. And it is a matter of joy to thinkthat God has sent the message of grace to so many millions, by the widespread of his gospel.
Rom 11:1-10	<br>There was a chosen remnant of believing Jews, who had righteousness andlife by faith in Jesus Christ. These were kept according to theelection of grace. If then this election was of grace, it could not beof works, either performed or foreseen. Every truly good disposition ina fallen creature must be the effect, therefore it cannot be the cause,of the grace of God bestowed on him. Salvation from the first to thelast must be either of grace or of debt. These things are so directlycontrary to each other that they cannot be blended together. Godglorifies his grace by changing the hearts and tempers of therebellious. How then should they wonder and praise him! The Jewishnation were as in a deep sleep, without knowledge of their danger, orconcern about it; having no sense of their need of the Saviour, or oftheir being upon the borders of eternal ruin. David, having by theSpirit foretold the sufferings of Christ from his own people, the Jews,foretells the dreadful judgments of God upon them for it, Ps 69. Thisteaches us how to understand other prayers of David against hisenemies; they are prophecies of the judgments of God, not expressionsof his own anger. Divine curses will work long; and we have our eyesdarkened, if we are bowed down in worldly-mindedness.
Rom 11:11-21	<br>The gospel is the greatest riches of every place where it is. Astherefore the righteous rejection of the unbelieving Jews, was theoccasion of so large a multitude of the Gentiles being reconciled toGod, and at peace with him; the future receiving of the Jews into thechurch would be such a change, as would resemble a general resurrectionof the dead in sin to a life of righteousness. Abraham was as the rootof the church. The Jews continued branches of this tree till, as anation, they rejected the Messiah; after that, their relation toAbraham and to God was, as it were, cut off. The Gentiles were graftedinto this tree in their room; being admitted into the church of God.Multitudes were made heirs of Abraham's faith, holiness andblessedness. It is the natural state of every one of us, to be wild bynature. Conversion is as the grafting in of wild branches into the goodolive. The wild olive was often ingrafted into the fruitful one when itbegan to decay, and this not only brought forth fruit, but caused thedecaying olive to revive and flourish. The Gentiles, of free grace, hadbeen grafted in to share advantages. They ought therefore to beware ofself-confidence, and every kind of pride or ambition; lest, having onlya dead faith, and an empty profession, they should turn from God, andforfeit their privileges. If we stand at all, it is by faith; we areguilty and helpless in ourselves, and are to be humble, watchful,afraid of self-deception, or of being overcome by temptation. Not onlyare we at first justified by faith, but kept to the end in thatjustified state by faith only; yet, by a faith which is not alone, butwhich worketh by love to God and man.
Rom 11:22-32	<br>Of all judgments, spiritual judgments are the sorest; of these theapostle is here speaking. The restoration of the Jews is, in the courseof things, far less improbable than the call of the Gentiles to be thechildren of Abraham; and though others now possess these privileges, itwill not hinder their being admitted again. By rejecting the gospel,and by their indignation at its being preached to the Gentiles, theJews were become enemies to God; yet they are still to be favoured forthe sake of their pious fathers. Though at present they are enemies tothe gospel, for their hatred to the Gentiles; yet, when God's time iscome, that will no longer exist, and God's love to their fathers willbe remembered. True grace seeks not to confine God's favour. Those whofind mercy themselves, should endeavour that through their mercy othersalso may obtain mercy. Not that the Jews will be restored to have theirpriesthood, and temple, and ceremonies again; an end is put to allthese; but they are to be brought to believe in Christ, the true becomeone sheep-fold with the Gentiles, under Christ the Great Shepherd. Thecaptivities of Israel, their dispersion, and their being shut out fromthe church, are emblems of the believer's corrections for doing wrong;and the continued care of the Lord towards that people, and the finalmercy and blessed restoration intended for them, show the patience andlove of God.
Rom 11:33-36	<br>The apostle Paul knew the mysteries of the kingdom of God as well asever any man; yet he confesses himself at a loss; and despairing tofind the bottom, he humbly sits down at the brink, and adores thedepth. Those who know most in this imperfect state, feel their ownweakness most. There is not only depth in the Divine counsels, butriches; abundance of that which is precious and valuable. The Divinecounsels are complete; they have not only depth and height, but breadthand length, Eph 3:18, and that passing knowledge. There is that vastdistance and disproportion between God and man, between the Creator andthe creature, which for ever shuts us from knowledge of his ways. Whatman shall teach God how to govern the world? The apostle adores thesovereignty of the Divine counsels. All things in heaven and earth,especially those which relate to our salvation, that belong to ourpeace, are all of him by way of creation, through him by way ofprovidence, that they may be to him in their end. Of God, as the Springand Fountain of all; through Christ, to God, as the end. These includeall God's relations to his creatures; if all are of Him, and throughHim, all should be to Him, and for Him. Whatever begins, let God'sglory be the end: especially let us adore him when we talk of theDivine counsels and actings. The saints in heaven never dispute, butalways praise.
Rom 12:1,2	<br>The apostle having closed the part of his epistle wherein he argues andproves various doctrines which are practically applied, here urgesimportant duties from gospel principles. He entreated the Romans, ashis brethren in Christ, by the mercies of God, to present their bodiesas a living sacrifice to Him. This is a powerful appeal. We receivefrom the Lord every day the fruits of his mercy. Let us renderourselves; all we are, all we have, all we can do: and after all, whatreturn is it for such very rich receivings? It is acceptable to God: areasonable service, which we are able and ready to give a reason for,and which we understand. Conversion and sanctification are the renewingof the mind; a change, not of the substance, but of the qualities ofthe soul. The progress of sanctification, dying to sin more and more,and living to righteousness more and more, is the carrying on thisrenewing work, till it is perfected in glory. The great enemy to thisrenewal is, conformity to this world. Take heed of forming plans forhappiness, as though it lay in the things of this world, which soonpass away. Do not fall in with the customs of those who walk in thelusts of the flesh, and mind earthly things. The work of the Holy Ghostfirst begins in the understanding, and is carried on to the will,affections, and conversation, till there is a change of the whole maninto the likeness of God, in knowledge, righteousness, and trueholiness. Thus, to be godly, is to give up ourselves to God.
Rom 12:3-8	<br>Pride is a sin in us by nature; we need to be cautioned and armedagainst it. All the saints make up one body in Christ, who is the Headof the body, and the common Centre of their unity. In the spiritualbody, some are fitted for and called to one sort of work; others foranother sort of work. We are to do all the good we can, one to another,and for the common benefit. If we duly thought about the powers wehave, and how far we fail properly to improve them, it would humble us.But as we must not be proud of our talents, so we must take heed lest,under a pretence of humility and self-denial, we are slothful in layingout ourselves for the good of others. We must not say, I am nothing,therefore I will sit still, and do nothing; but, I am nothing inmyself, and therefore I will lay out myself to the utmost, in thestrength of the grace of Christ. Whatever our gifts or situations maybe, let us try to employ ourselves humbly, diligently, cheerfully, andin simplicity; not seeking our own credit or profit, but the good ofmany, for this world and that which is to come.
Rom 12:9-16	<br>The professed love of Christians to each other should be sincere, freefrom deceit, and unmeaning and deceitful compliments. Depending onDivine grace, they must detest and dread all evil, and love and delightin whatever is kind and useful. We must not only do that which is good,but we must cleave to it. All our duty towards one another is summed upin one word, love. This denotes the love of parents to their children;which is more tender and natural than any other; unforced,unconstrained. And love to God and man, with zeal for the gospel, willmake the wise Christian diligent in all his wordly business, and ingaining superior skill. God must be served with the spirit, under theinfluences of the Holy Spirit. He is honoured by our hope and trust inhim, especially when we rejoice in that hope. He is served, not only byworking for him, but by sitting still quietly, when he calls us tosuffer. Patience for God's sake, is true piety. Those that rejoice inhope, are likely to be patient in tribulation. We should not be cold inthe duty of prayer, nor soon weary of it. Not only must there bekindness to friends and brethren, but Christians must not harbour angeragainst enemies. It is but mock love, which rests in words of kindness,while our brethren need real supplies, and it is in our power tofurnish them. Be ready to entertain those who do good: as there isoccasion, we must welcome strangers. Bless, and curse not. It meansthorough good will; not, bless them when at prayer, and curse them atother times; but bless them always, and curse not at all. TrueChristian love will make us take part in the sorrows and joys of eachother. Labour as much as you can to agree in the same spiritual truths;and when you come short of that, yet agree in affection. Look uponworldly pomp and dignity with holy contempt. Do not mind it; be not inlove with it. Be reconciled to the place God in his providence puts youin, whatever it be. Nothing is below us, but sin. We shall never findin our hearts to condescend to others, while we indulge conceit ofourselves; therefore that must be mortified.
Rom 12:17-21	<br>Since men became enemies to God, they have been very ready to beenemies one to another. And those that embrace religion, must expect tomeet with enemies in a world whose smiles seldom agree with Christ's.Recompense to no man evil for evil. That is a brutish recompence,befitting only animals, which are not conscious of any being abovethem, or of any existence hereafter. And not only do, but study andtake care to do, that which is amiable and creditable, and recommendsreligion to all with whom you converse. Study the things that make forpeace; if it be possible, without offending God and woundingconscience. Avenge not yourselves. This is a hard lesson to corruptnature, therefore a remedy against it is added. Give place unto wrath.When a man's passion is up, and the stream is strong, let it pass off;lest it be made to rage the more against us. The line of our duty isclearly marked out, and if our enemies are not melted by perseveringkindness, we are not to seek vengeance; they will be consumed by thefiery wrath of that God to whom vengeance belongeth. The last versesuggests what is not easily understood by the world; that in all strifeand contention, those that revenge are conquered, and those thatforgive are conquerors. Be not overcome of evil. Learn to defeat illdesigns against you, either to change them, or to preserve your ownpeace. He that has this rule over his spirit, is better than themighty. God's children may be asked whether it is not more sweet untothem than all earthly good, that God so enables them by his Spirit,thus to feel and act.
Rom 13:1-7	<br>The grace of the gospel teaches us submission and quiet, where prideand the carnal mind only see causes for murmuring and discontent.Whatever the persons in authority over us themselves may be, yet thejust power they have, must be submitted to and obeyed. In the generalcourse of human affairs, rulers are not a terror to honest, quiet, andgood subjects, but to evil-doers. Such is the power of sin andcorruption, that many will be kept back from crimes only by the fear ofpunishment. Thou hast the benefit of the government, therefore do whatthou canst to preserve it, and nothing to disturb it. This directsprivate persons to behave quietly and peaceably where God has set them,1Ti 2:1,2. Christians must not use any trick or fraud. All smuggling,dealing in contraband goods, withholding or evading duties, isrebellion against the express command of God. Thus honest neighboursare robbed, who will have to pay the more; and the crimes of smugglers,and others who join with them, are abetted. It is painful that someprofessors of the gospel should countenance such dishonest practices.The lesson here taught it becomes all Christians to learn and practise,that the godly in the land will always be found the quiet and thepeaceable in the land, whatever others are.
Rom 13:8-10	<br>Christians must avoid useless expense, and be careful not to contractany debts they have not the power to discharge. They are also to standaloof from all venturesome speculations and rash engagements, andwhatever may expose them to the danger of not rendering to all theirdue. Do not keep in any one's debt. Give every one his own. Do notspend that on yourselves, which you owe to others. But many who arevery sensible of the trouble, think little of the sin, of being indebt. Love to others includes all the duties of the second table. Thelast five of the ten commandments are all summed up in this royal law,Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself; with the same sincerity thatthou lovest thyself, though not in the same measure and degree. He thatloves his neighbour as himself, will desire the welfare of hisneighbour. On this is built that golden rule, of doing as we would bedone by. Love is a living, active principle of obedience to the wholelaw. Let us not only avoid injuries to the persons, connexions,property, and characters of men; but do no kind or degree of evil toany man, and study to be useful in every station of life.
Rom 13:11-14	<br>Four things are here taught, as a Christian's directory for his day'swork. When to awake; Now; and to awake out of the sleep of carnalsecurity, sloth, and negligence; out of the sleep of spiritual death,and out of the sleep of spiritual deadness. Considering the time; abusy time; a perilous time. Also the salvation nigh at hand. Let usmind our way, and mend our pace, we are nearer our journey's end. Alsoto make ourselves ready. The night is far spent, the day is at hand;therefore it is time to dress ourselves. Observe what we must put off;clothes worn in the night. Cast off the sinful works of darkness.Observe what we must put on; how we should dress our souls. Put on thearmour of light. A Christian must reckon himself undressed, if unarmed.The graces of the Spirit are this armour, to secure the soul fromSatan's temptations, and the assaults of this present evil world. Puton Christ; that includes all. Put on righteousness of Christ, forjustification. Put on the Spirit and grace of Christ, forsanctification. The Lord Jesus Christ must be put on as Lord to ruleyou as Jesus to save you; and in both, as Christ anointed and appointedby the Father to this ruling, saving work. And how to walk. When we areup and ready, we are not to sit still, but to appear abroad; let uswalk. Christianity teaches us how to walk so as to please God, who eversees us. Walk honestly as in the day; avoiding the works of darkness.Where there are riot and drunkenness, there usually are chambering andwantonness, and strife and envy. Solomon puts these all together, Pr23:29-35. See what provision to make. Our great care must be to providefor our souls: but must we take no care about our bodies? Yes; but twothings are forbidden. Perplexing ourselves with anxious, encumberingcare; and indulging ourselves in irregular desires. Natural wants areto be answered, but evil appetites must be checked and denied. To askmeat for our necessities, is our duty, we are taught to pray for dailybread; but to ask meat for our lusts, is provoking God, Ps 78:18.
Rom 14:1-6	<br>Differences of opinion prevailed even among the immediate followers ofChrist and their disciples. Nor did St. Paul attempt to end them.Compelled assent to any doctrine, or conformity to outward observanceswithout being convinced, would be hypocritical and of no avail.Attempts for producing absolute oneness of mind among Christians wouldbe useless. Let not Christian fellowship be disturbed with strifes ofwords. It will be good for us to ask ourselves, when tempted to disdainand blame our brethren; Has not God owned them? and if he has, dare Idisown them? Let not the Christian who uses his liberty, despise hisweak brother as ignorant and superstitious. Let not the scrupulousbeliever find fault with his brother, for God accepted him, withoutregarding the distinctions of meats. We usurp the place of God, when wetake upon us thus to judge the thoughts and intentions of others, whichare out of our view. The case as to the observance of days was much thesame. Those who knew that all these things were done away by Christ'scoming, took no notice of the festivals of the Jews. But it is notenough that our consciences consent to what we do; it is necessary thatit be certified from the word of God. Take heed of acting against adoubting conscience. We are all apt to make our own views the standardof truth, to deem things certain which to others appear doubtful. ThusChristians often despise or condemn each other, about doubtful mattersof no moment. A thankful regard to God, the Author and Giver of all ourmercies, sanctifies and sweetens them.
Rom 14:7-13	<br>Though some are weak, and others are strong, yet all must agree not tolive to themselves. No one who has given up his name to Christ, isallowedly a self-seeker; that is against true Christianity. Thebusiness of our lives is not to please ourselves, but to please God.That is true Christianity, which makes Christ all in all. ThoughChristians are of different strength, capacities, and practices inlesser things, yet they are all the Lord's; all are looking andserving, and approving themselves to Christ. He is Lord of those thatare living, to rule them; of those that are dead, to revive them, andraise them up. Christians should not judge or despise one another,because both the one and the other must shortly give an account. Abelieving regard to the judgment of the great day, would silence rashjudgings. Let every man search his own heart and life; he that isstrict in judging and humbling himself, will not be apt to judge anddespise his brother. We must take heed of saying or doing things whichmay cause others to stumble or to fall. The one signifies a lesser, theother a greater degree of offence; that which may be an occasion ofgrief or of guilt to our brother.
Rom 14:14-18	<br>Christ deals gently with those who have true grace, though they areweak in it. Consider the design of Christ's death: also that drawing asoul to sin, threatens the destruction of that soul. Did Christ denyhimself for our brethren, so as to die for them, and shall not we denyourselves for them, so as to keep from any indulgence? We cannot hinderungoverned tongues from speaking evil; but we must not give them anyoccasion. We must deny ourselves in many cases what we may lawfully do,when our doing it may hurt our good name. Our good often comes to beevil spoken of, because we use lawful things in an uncharitable andselfish manner. As we value the reputation of the good we profess andpractise, let us seek that it may not be evil-spoken of. Righteousness,peace, and joy, are words that mean a great deal. As to God, our greatconcern is to appear before him justified by Christ's death, sanctifiedby the Spirit of his grace; for the righteous Lord lovethrighteousness. As to our brethren, it is to live in peace, and love,and charity with them; following peace with all men. As to ourselves,it is joy in the Holy Ghost; that spiritual joy wrought by the blessedSpirit in the hearts of believers, which respects God as theirreconciled Father, and heaven as their expected home. Regard to Christin doing our duties, alone can make them acceptable. Those are mostpleasing to God that are best pleased with him; and they abound most inpeace and joy in the Holy Ghost. They are approved by wise and goodmen; and the opinion of others is not to be regarded.
Rom 14:19-23	<br>Many wish for peace, and talk loudly for it, who do not follow thethings that make for peace. Meekness, humility, self-denial, and love,make for peace. We cannot edify one another, while quarrelling andcontending. Many, for meat and drink, destroy the work of God inthemselves; nothing more destroys the soul than pampering and pleasingthe flesh, and fulfilling the lusts of it; so others are hurt, bywilful offence given. Lawful things may be done unlawfully, by givingoffence to brethren. This takes in all indifferent things, whereby abrother is drawn into sin or trouble; or has his graces, his comforts,or his resolutions weakened. Hast thou faith? It is meant of knowledgeand clearness as to our Christian liberty. Enjoy the comfort of it, butdo not trouble others by a wrong use of it. Nor may we act against adoubting conscience. How excellent are the blessings of Christ'skingdom, which consists not in outward rites and ceremonies, but inrighteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost! How preferable is theservice of God to all other services! and in serving him we are notcalled to live and die to ourselves, but unto Christ, whose we are, andwhom we ought to serve.
Rom 15:1-7	<br>Christian liberty was allowed, not for our pleasure, but for the gloryof God, and the good of others. We must please our neighbour, for thegood of his soul; not by serving his wicked will, and humouring him ina sinful way; if we thus seek to please men, we are not the servants ofChrist. Christ's whole life was a self-denying, self-displeasing life.And he is the most advanced Christian, who is the most conformed toChrist. Considering his spotless purity and holiness, nothing could bemore contrary to him, than to be made sin and a curse for us, and tohave the reproaches of God fall upon him; the just for the unjust. Hebore the guilt of sin, and the curse for it; we are only called to beara little of the trouble of it. He bore the presumptuous sins of thewicked; we are called only to bear the failings of the weak. And shouldnot we be humble, self-denying, and ready to consider one another, whoare members one of another? The Scriptures are written for our use andbenefit, as much as for those to whom they were first given. Those aremost learned who are most mighty in the Scriptures. That comfort whichsprings from the word of God, is the surest and sweetest, and thegreatest stay to hope. The Spirit as a Comforter, is the earnest of ourinheritance. This like-mindedness must be according to the precept ofChrist, according to his pattern and example. It is the gift of God;and a precious gift it is, for which we must earnestly seek unto him.Our Divine Master invites his disciples, and encourages them by showinghimself as meek and lowly in spirit. The same disposition ought to markthe conduct of his servants, especially of the strong towards the weak.The great end in all our actions must be, that God may be glorified;nothing more forwards this, than the mutual love and kindness of thosewho profess religion. Those that agree in Christ may well agree amongthemselves.
Rom 15:8-13	<br>Christ fulfilled the prophecies and promises relating to the Jews, andthe Gentile converts could have no excuse for despising them. TheGentiles, being brought into the church, are companions in patience andtribulation. They should praise God. Calling upon all the nations topraise the Lord, shows that they shall have knowledge of him. We shallnever seek to Christ till we trust in him. And the whole plan ofredemption is suited to reconcile us to one another, as well as to ourgracious God, so that an abiding hope of eternal life, through thesanctifying and comforting power of the Holy Spirit, may be attained.Our own power will never reach this; therefore where this hope is, andis abounding, the blessed Spirit must have all the glory. "All joy andpeace;" all sorts of true joy and peace, so as to suppress doubts andfears, through the powerful working of the Holy Spirit.
Rom 15:14-21	<br>The apostle was persuaded that the Roman Christians were filled with akind and affectionate spirit, as well as with knowledge. He had writtento remind them of their duties and their dangers, because God hadappointed him the minister of Christ to the Gentiles. Paul preached tothem; but what made them sacrifices to God, was, their sanctification;not his work, but the work of the Holy Ghost: unholy things can neverbe pleasing to the holy God. The conversion of souls pertains unto God;therefore it is the matter of Paul's glorying, not the things of theflesh. But though a great preacher, he could not make one soulobedient, further than the Spirit of God accompanied his labours. Heprincipally sought the good of those that sat in darkness. Whatevergood we do, it is Christ who does it by us.
Rom 15:22-29	<br>The apostle sought the things of Christ more than his own will, andwould not leave his work of planting churches to go to Rome. Itconcerns all to do that first which is most needful. We must not takeit ill if our friends prefer work which is pleasing to God, beforevisits and compliments, which may please us. It is justly expected fromall Christians, that they should promote every good work, especiallythat blessed work, the conversion of souls. Christian society is aheaven upon earth, an earnest of our gathering together unto Christ atthe great day. Yet it is but partial, compared with our communion withChrist; for that only will satisfy the soul. The apostle was going toJerusalem, as the messenger of charity. God loves a cheerful giver.Every thing that passes between Christians should be a proof andinstance of the union they have in Jesus Christ. The Gentiles receivedthe gospel of salvation from the Jews; therefore were bound to ministerto them in what was needed for the body. Concerning what he expectedfrom them he speaks doubtfully; but concerning what he expected fromGod he speaks confidently. We cannot expect too little from man, nortoo much from God. And how delightful and advantageous it is to havethe gospel with the fulness of its blessings! What wonderful and happyeffects does it produce, when attended with the power of the Spirit!
Rom 15:30-33	<br>Let us learn to value the effectual fervent prayers of the righteous.How careful should we be, lest we forfeit our interest in the love andprayers of God's praying people! If we have experienced the Spirit'slove, let us not be wanting in this office of kindness for others.Those that would prevail in prayer, must strive in prayer. Those whobeg the prayers of others, must not neglect to pray for themselves. Andthough Christ knows our state and wants perfectly, he will know themfrom us. As God must be sought, for restraining the ill-will of ourenemies, so also for preserving and increasing the good-will of ourfriends. All our joy depends upon the will of God. Let us be earnest inprayer with and for each other, that for Christ's sake, and by the loveof the Holy Spirit, great blessings may come upon the souls ofChristians, and the labours of ministers.
Rom 16:1-16	<br>Paul recommends Phebe to the Christians at Rome. It becomes Christiansto help one another in their affairs, especially strangers; we know notwhat help we may need ourselves. Paul asks help for one that had beenhelpful to many; he that watereth shall be watered also himself. Thoughthe care of all the churches came upon him daily, yet he could remembermany persons, and send salutations to each, with particular charactersof them, and express concern for them. Lest any should feel themselveshurt, as if Paul had forgotten them, he sends his remembrances to therest, as brethren and saints, though not named. He adds, in the close,a general salutation to them all, in the name of the churches ofChrist.
Rom 16:17-20	<br>How earnest, how endearing are these exhortations! Whatever differsfrom the sound doctrine of the Scriptures, opens a door to divisionsand offences. If truth be forsaken, unity and peace will not last long.Many call Christ, Master and Lord, who are far from serving him. Butthey serve their carnal, sensual, worldly interests. They corrupt thehead by deceiving the heart; perverting the judgments by windingthemselves into the affections. We have great need to keep our heartswith all diligence. It has been the common policy of seducers to setupon those who are softened by convictions. A pliable temper is goodwhen under good guidance, otherwise it may be easily led astray. Be sowise as not to be deceived, yet so simple as not to be deceivers. Theblessing the apostle expects from God, is victory over Satan. Thisincludes all designs and devices of Satan against souls, to defile,disturb, and destroy them; all his attempts to keep us from the peaceof heaven here, and the possession of heaven hereafter. When Satanseems to prevail, and we are ready to give up all as lost, then willthe God of peace interpose in our behalf. Hold out therefore, faith andpatience, yet a little while. If the grace of Christ be with us, whocan prevail against us?
Rom 16:21-24	<br>The apostle adds affectionate remembrances from persons with him, knownto the Roman Christians. It is a great comfort to see the holiness andusefulness of our kindred. Not many mighty, not many noble are called,but some are. It is lawful for believers to bear civil offices; and itwere to be wished that all offices in Christian states, and in thechurch, were bestowed upon prudent and steady Christians.
Rom 16:25-27	<br>That which establishes souls, is, the plain preaching of Jesus Christ.Our redemption and salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ, are, withoutcontroversy, a great mystery of godliness. And yet, blessed be God,there is as much of this mystery made plain as will bring us to heaven,if we do not wilfully neglect so great salvation. Life and immortalityare brought to light by the gospel, and the Sun of Righteousness isrisen on the world. The Scriptures of the prophets, what they left inwriting, is not only made plain in itself, but by it this mystery ismade known to all nations. Christ is salvation to all nations. And thegospel is revealed, not to be talked of and disputed about, but to besubmitted to. The obedience of faith is that obedience which is paid tothe word of faith, and which comes by the grace of faith. All the glorythat passes from fallen man to God, so as to be accepted of him, mustgo through the Lord Jesus, in whom alone our persons and doings are, orcan be, pleasing to God. Of his righteousness we must make mention,even of his only; who, as he is the Mediator of all our prayers, so heis, and will be, to eternity, the Mediator of all our praises.Remembering that we are called to the obedience of faith, and thatevery degree of wisdom is from the only wise God, we should, by wordand deed, render glory to him through Jesus Christ; that so the graceof our Lord Jesus Christ may be with us for ever.
1Co 1:1-9	<br>All Christians are by baptism dedicated and devoted to Christ, and areunder strict obligations to be holy. But in the true church of God areall who are sanctified in Christ Jesus, called to be saints, and whocall upon him as God manifest in the flesh, for all the blessings ofsalvation; who acknowledge and obey him as their Lord, and as Lord ofall; it includes no other persons. Christians are distinguished fromthe profane and atheists, that they dare not live without prayer; andthey are distinguished from Jews and pagans, that they call on the nameof Christ. Observe how often in these verses the apostle repeats thewords, Our Lord Jesus Christ. He feared not to make too frequent or toohonourable mention of him. To all who called upon Christ, the apostlegave his usual salutation, desiring, in their behalf, the pardoningmercy, sanctifying grace, and comforting peace of God, through JesusChrist. Sinners can have no peace with God, nor any from him, butthrough Christ. He gives thanks for their conversion to the faith ofChrist; that grace was given them by Jesus Christ. They had beenenriched by him with all spiritual gifts. He speaks of utterance andknowledge. And where God has given these two gifts, he has given greatpower for usefulness. These were gifts of the Holy Ghost, by which Godbore witness to the apostles. Those that wait for the coming of ourLord Jesus Christ, will be kept by him to the end; and those that areso, will be blameless in the day of Christ, made so by rich and freegrace. How glorious are the hopes of such a privilege; to be kept bythe power of Christ, from the power of our corruptions and Satan'stemptations!
1Co 1:10-16	<br>In the great things of religion be of one mind; and where there is notunity of sentiment, still let there be union of affection. Agreement inthe greater things should extinguish divisions about the lesser. Therewill be perfect union in heaven, and the nearer we approach it onearth, the nearer we come to perfection. Paul and Apollos both werefaithful ministers of Jesus Christ, and helpers of their faith and joy;but those disposed to be contentious, broke into parties. So liable arethe best things to be corrupted, and the gospel and its institutionsmade engines of discord and contention. Satan has always endeavoured tostir up strife among Christians, as one of his chief devices againstthe gospel. The apostle left it to other ministers to baptize, while hepreached the gospel, as a more useful work.
1Co 1:17-25	<br>Paul had been bred up in Jewish learning; but the plain preaching of acrucified Jesus, was more powerful than all the oratory and philosophyof the heathen world. This is the sum and substance of the gospel.Christ crucified is the foundation of all our hopes, the fountain ofall our joys. And by his death we live. The preaching of salvation forlost sinners by the sufferings and death of the Son of God, ifexplained and faithfully applied, appears foolishness to those in theway to destruction. The sensual, the covetous, the proud, andambitious, alike see that the gospel opposes their favourite pursuits.But those who receive the gospel, and are enlightened by the Spirit ofGod, see more of God's wisdom and power in the doctrine of Christcrucified, than in all his other works. God left a great part of theworld to follow the dictates of man's boasted reason, and the event hasshown that human wisdom is folly, and is unable to find or retain theknowledge of God as the Creator. It pleased him, by the foolishness ofpreaching, to save them that believe. By the foolishness of preaching;not by what could justly be called foolish preaching. But the thingpreached was foolishness to wordly-wise men. The gospel ever was, andever will be, foolishness to all in the road to destruction. Themessage of Christ, plainly delivered, ever has been a sure touchstoneby which men may learn what road they are travelling. But the despiseddoctrine of salvation by faith in a crucified Saviour, God in humannature, purchasing the church with his own blood, to save multitudes,even all that believe, from ignorance, delusion, and vice, has beenblessed in every age. And the weakest instruments God uses, arestronger in their effects, than the strongest men can use. Not thatthere is foolishness or weakness in God, but what men consider as such,overcomes all their admired wisdom and strength.
1Co 1:26-31	<br>God did not choose philosophers, nor orators, nor statesmen, nor men ofwealth, and power, and interest in the world, to publish the gospel ofgrace and peace. He best judges what men and what measures serve thepurposes of his glory. Though not many noble are usually called byDivine grace, there have been some such in every age, who have not beenashamed of the gospel of Christ; and persons of every rank stand inneed of pardoning grace. Often, a humble Christian, though poor as tothis world, has more true knowledge of the gospel, than those who havemade the letter of Scripture the study of their lives, but who havestudied it rather as the witness of men, than as the word of God. Andeven young children have gained such knowledge of Divine truth as tosilence infidels. The reason is, they are taught of God; the design is,that no flesh should glory in his presence. That distinction, in whichalone they might glory, was not of themselves. It was by the sovereignchoice and regenerating grace of God, that they were in Jesus Christ byfaith. He is made of God to us wisdom, righteousness, sanctification,and redemption; all we need, or can desire. And he is made wisdom tous, that by his word and Spirit, and from his fulness and treasures ofwisdom and knowledge, we may receive all that will make us wise untosalvation, and fit for every service to which we are called. We areguilty, liable to just punishment; and he is made righteousness, ourgreat atonement and sacrifice. We are depraved and corrupt, and he ismade sanctification, that he may in the end be made completeredemption; may free the soul from the being of sin, and loose the bodyfrom the bonds of the grave. And this is, that all flesh, according tothe prophecy by Jeremiah, Jer 9:23-24, may glory in the special favour,all-sufficient grace, and precious salvation of Jehovah.
1Co 2:1-5	<br>Christ, in his person, and offices, and sufferings, is the sum andsubstance of the gospel, and ought to be the great subject of a gospelminister's preaching, but not so as to leave out other parts of God'srevealed truth and will. Paul preached the whole counsel of God. Fewknow the fear and trembling of faithful ministers, from a deep sense oftheir own weakness They know how insufficient they are, and are fearfulfor themselves. When nothing but Christ crucified is plainly preached,the success must be entirely from Divine power accompanying the word,and thus men are brought to believe, to the salvation of their souls.
1Co 2:6-9	<br>Those who receive the doctrine of Christ as Divine, and, having beenenlightened by the Holy Spirit, have looked well into it, see not onlythe plain history of Christ, and him crucified, but the deep andadmirable designs of Divine wisdom therein. It is the mystery mademanifest to the saints, Col 1:26, though formerly hid from the heathenworld; it was only shown in dark types and distant prophecies, but nowis revealed and made known by the Spirit of God. Jesus Christ is theLord of glory; a title much too great for any creature. There are manythings which people would not do, if they knew the wisdom of God in thegreat work of redemption. There are things God hath prepared for thosethat love him, and wait for him, which sense cannot discover, noteaching can convey to our ears, nor can it yet enter our hearts. Wemust take them as they stand in the Scriptures, as God hath beenpleased to reveal them to us.
1Co 2:10-16	<br>God has revealed true wisdom to us by his Spirit. Here is a proof ofthe Divine authority of the Holy Scriptures, 2Pe 1:21. In proof of theDivinity of the Holy Ghost, observe, that he knows all things, and hesearches all things, even the deep things of God. No one can know thethings of God, but his Holy Spirit, who is one with the Father and theSon, and who makes known Divine mysteries to his church. This is mostclear testimony, both to the real Godhead and the distinct person ofthe Holy Spirit. The apostles were not guided by worldly principles.They had the revelation of these things from the Spirit of God, and thesaving impression of them from the same Spirit. These things theydeclared in plain, simple language, taught by the Holy Spirit, totallydifferent from the affected oratory or enticing words of man's wisdom.The natural man, the wise man of the world, receives not the things ofthe Spirit of God. The pride of carnal reasoning is really as muchopposed to spirituality, as the basest sensuality. The sanctified minddiscerns the real beauties of holiness, but the power of discerning andjudging about common and natural things is not lost. But the carnal manis a stranger to the principles, and pleasures, and actings of theDivine life. The spiritual man only, is the person to whom God givesthe knowledge of his will. How little have any known of the mind of Godby natural power! And the apostles were enabled by his Spirit to makeknown his mind. In the Holy Scriptures, the mind of Christ, and themind of God in Christ, are fully made known to us. It is the greatprivilege of Christians, that they have the mind of Christ revealed tothem by his Spirit. They experience his sanctifying power in theirhearts, and bring forth good fruits in their lives.
1Co 3:1-4	<br>The most simple truths of the gospel, as to man's sinfulness and God'smercy, repentance towards God, and faith in our Lord Jesus Christ,stated in the plainest language, suit the people better than deepermysteries. Men may have much doctrinal knowledge, yet be mere beginnersin the life of faith and experience. Contentions and quarrels aboutreligion are sad evidences of carnality. True religion makes menpeaceable, not contentious. But it is to be lamented, that many whoshould walk as Christians, live and act too much like other men. Manyprofessors, and preachers also, show themselves to be yet carnal, byvain-glorious strife, eagerness for dispute, and readiness to despiseand speak evil of others.
1Co 3:5-9	<br>The ministers about whom the Corinthians contended, were onlyinstruments used by God. We should not put ministers into the place ofGod. He that planteth and he that watereth are one, employed by oneMaster, trusted with the same revelation, busied in one work, andengaged in one design. They have their different gifts from one and thesame Spirit, for the very same purposes; and should carry on the samedesign heartily. Those who work hardest shall fare best. Those who aremost faithful shall have the greatest reward. They work together withGod, in promoting the purposes of his glory, and the salvation ofprecious souls; and He who knows their work, will take care they do notlabour in vain. They are employed in his husbandry and building; and Hewill carefully look over them.
1Co 3:10-15	<br>The apostle was a wise master-builder; but the grace of God made himsuch. Spiritual pride is abominable; it is using the greatest favoursof God, to feed our own vanity, and make idols of ourselves. But letevery man take heed; there may be bad building on a good foundation.Nothing must be laid upon it, but what the foundation will bear, andwhat is of a piece with it. Let us not dare to join a merely human or acarnal life with a Divine faith, the corruption of sin with theprofession of Christianity. Christ is a firm, abiding, and immovableRock of ages, every way able to bear all the weight that God himself orthe sinner can lay upon him; neither is there salvation in any other.Leave out the doctrine of his atonement, and there is no foundation forour hopes. But of those who rest on this foundation, there are twosorts. Some hold nothing but the truth as it is in Jesus, and preachnothing else. Others build on the good foundation what will not abidethe test, when the day of trail comes. We may be mistaken in ourselvesand others; but there is a day coming that will show our actions in thetrue light, without covering or disguise. Those who spread true andpure religion in all its branches, and whose work will abide in thegreat day, shall receive a reward. And how great! how much exceedingtheir deserts! There are others, whose corrupt opinions and doctrines,or vain inventions and usages in the worship of God, shall be madeknown, disowned, and rejected, in that day. This is plainly meant of afigurative fire, not of a real one; for what real fire can consumereligious rites or doctrines? And it is to try every man's works, thoseof Paul and Apollos, as well as others. Let us consider the tendency ofour undertakings, compare them with God's word, and judge ourselves,that we be not judged of the Lord.
1Co 3:16,17	<br>From other parts of the epistle, it appears that the false teachersamong the Corinthians taught unholy doctrines. Such teaching tended tocorrupt, to pollute, and destroy the building, which should be keptpure and holy for God. Those who spread loose principles, which renderthe church of God unholy, bring destruction upon themselves. Christ byhis Spirit dwells in all true believers. Christians are holy byprofession, and should be pure and clean, both in heart andconversation. He is deceived who deems himself the temple of the HolyGhost, yet is unconcerned about personal holiness, or the peace andpurity of the church.
1Co 3:18-23	<br>To have a high opinion of our own wisdom, is but to flatter ourselves;and self-flattery is the next step to self-deceit. The wisdom thatwordly men esteem, is foolishness with God. How justly does he despise,and how easily can he baffle and confound it! The thoughts of thewisest men in the world, have vanity, weakness, and folly in them. Allthis should teach us to be humble, and make us willing to be taught ofGod, so as not to be led away, by pretences to human wisdom and skill,from the simple truths revealed by Christ. Mankind are very apt tooppose the design of the mercies of God. Observe the spiritual richesof a true believer; "All are yours," even ministers and ordinances.Nay, the world itself is yours. Saints have as much of it as InfiniteWisdom sees fit for them, and they have it with the Divine blessing.Life is yours, that you may have a season and opportunity to preparefor the life of heaven; and death is yours, that you may go to thepossession of it. It is the kind messenger to take you from sin andsorrow, and to guide you to your Father's house. Things present areyours, for your support on the road; things to come are yours, todelight you for ever at your journey's end. If we belong to Christ, andare true to him, all good belongs to us, and is sure to us. Believersare the subjects of his kingdom. He is Lord over us, we must own hisdominion, and cheerfully submit to his command. God in Christ,reconciling a sinful world to himself, and pouring the riches of hisgrace on a reconciled world, is the sum and substance of the gospel.
1Co 4:1-6	<br>Apostles were no more than servants of Christ, but they were not to beundervalued. They had a great trust, and for that reason, had anhonourable office. Paul had a just concern for his own reputation, buthe knew that he who chiefly aimed to please men, would not provehimself a faithful servant of Christ. It is a comfort that men are notto be our final judges. And it is not judging well of ourselves, orjustifying ourselves, that will prove us safe and happy. Our ownjudgment is not to be depended upon as to our faithfulness, any morethan our own works for our justification. There is a day coming, thatwill bring men's secret sins into open day, and discover the secrets oftheir hearts. Then every slandered believer will be justified, andevery faithful servant approved and rewarded. The word of God is thebest rule by which to judge as to men. Pride commonly is at the bottomof quarrels. Self-conceit contributes to produce undue esteem of ourteachers, as well as of ourselves. We shall not be puffed up for oneagainst another, if we remember that all are instruments, employed byGod, and endowed by him with various talents.
1Co 4:7-13	<br>We have no reason to be proud; all we have, or are, or do, that isgood, is owing to the free and rich grace of God. A sinner snatchedfrom destruction by sovereign grace alone, must be very absurd andinconsistent, if proud of the free gifts of God. St. Paul sets forthhis own circumstances, ver. 9 Allusion is made to the cruel spectaclesin the Roman games; where men were forced to cut one another to pieces,to divert the people; and where the victor did not escape with hislife, though he should destroy his adversary, but was only kept foranother combat, and must be killed at last. The thought that many eyesare upon believers, when struggling with difficulties or temptations,should encourage constancy and patience. "We are weak, but ye arestrong." All Christians are not alike exposed. Some suffer greaterhardships than others. The apostle enters into particulars of theirsufferings. And how glorious the charity and devotion that carried themthrough all these hardships! They suffered in their persons andcharacters as the worst and vilest of men; as the very dirt of theworld, that was to be swept away: nay, as the offscouring of allthings, the dross of all things. And every one who would be faithful inChrist Jesus, must be prepared for poverty and contempt. Whatever thedisciples of Christ suffer from men, they must follow the example, andfulfil the will and precepts of their Lord. They must be content, withhim and for him, to be despised and abused. It is much better to berejected, despised, and ill used, as St. Paul was, than to have thegood opinion and favour of the world. Though cast off by the world asvile, yet we may be precious to God, gathered up with his own hand, andplaced upon his throne.
1Co 4:14-21	<br>In reproving for sin, we should distinguish between sinners and theirsins. Reproofs that kindly and affectionately warn, are likely toreform. Though the apostle spoke with authority as a parent, he wouldrather beseech them in love. And as ministers are to set an example,others must follow them, as far as they follow Christ in faith andpractice. Christians may mistake and differ in their views, but Christand Christian truth are the same yesterday, to-day, and for ever.Whenever the gospel is effectual, it comes not in word only, but alsoin power, by the Holy Spirit, quickening dead sinners, deliveringpersons from the slavery of sin and Satan, renewing them both inwardlyand outwardly, and comforting, strengthening, and establishing thesaints, which cannot be done by the persuasive language of men, but bythe power of God. And it is a happy temper, to have the spirit of loveand meekness bear the rule, yet to maintain just authority.
1Co 5:1-8	<br>The apostle notices a flagrant abuse, winked at by the Corinthians.Party spirit, and a false notion of Christian liberty, seem to havesaved the offender from censure. Grievous indeed is it that crimesshould sometimes be committed by professors of the gospel, of whicheven heathens would be ashamed. Spiritual pride and false doctrinestend to bring in, and to spread such scandals. How dreadful the effectsof sin! The devil reigns where Christ does not. And a man is in hiskingdom, and under his power, when not in Christ. The bad example of aman of influence is very mischievous; it spreads far and wide. Corruptprinciples and examples, if not corrected, would hurt the whole church.Believers must have new hearts, and lead new lives. Their commonconversation and religious deeds must be holy. So far is the sacrificeof Christ our Passover for us, from rendering personal and publicholiness unnecessary, that it furnishes powerful reasons and motivesfor it. Without holiness we can neither live by faith in him, nor joinin his ordinances with comfort and profit.
1Co 5:9-13	<br>Christians are to avoid familiar converse with all who disgrace theChristian name. Such are only fit companions for their brethren in sin,and to such company they should be left, whenever it is possible to doso. Alas, that there are many called Christians, whose conversation ismore dangerous than that of heathens!
1Co 6:1-8	<br>Christians should not contend with one another, for they are brethren.This, if duly attended to, would prevent many law-suits, and end manyquarrels and disputes. In matters of great damage to ourselves orfamilies, we may use lawful means to right ourselves, but Christiansshould be of a forgiving temper. Refer the matters in dispute, ratherthan go to law about them. They are trifles, and may easily be settled,if you first conquer your own spirits. Bear and forbear, and the men ofleast skill among you may end your quarrels. It is a shame that littlequarrels should grow to such a head among Christians, that they cannotbe determined by the brethren. The peace of a man's own mind, and thecalm of his neighbourhood, are worth more than victory. Lawsuits couldnot take place among brethren, unless there were faults among them.
1Co 6:9-11	<br>The Corinthians are warned against many great evils, of which they hadformerly been guilty. There is much force in these inquiries, when weconsider that they were addressed to a people puffed up with a fancy oftheir being above others in wisdom and knowledge. All unrighteousnessis sin; all reigning sin, nay, every actual sin, committed with design,and not repented of, shuts out of the kingdom of heaven. Be notdeceived. Men are very much inclined to flatter themselves that theymay live in sin, yet die in Christ, and go to heaven. But we cannothope to sow to the flesh, and reap everlasting life. They are remindedwhat a change the gospel and grace of God had made in them. The bloodof Christ, and the washing of regeneration, can take away all guilt.Our justification is owing to the suffering and merit of Christ; oursanctification to the working of the Holy Spirit; but both go together.All who are made righteous in the sight of God, are made holy by thegrace of God.
1Co 6:12-20	<br>Some among the Corinthians seem to have been ready to say, All thingsare lawful for me. This dangerous conceit St. Paul opposes. There is aliberty wherewith Christ has made us free, in which we must stand fast.But surely a Christian would never put himself into the power of anybodily appetite. The body is for the Lord; is to be an instrument ofrighteousness to holiness, therefore is never to be made an instrumentof sin. It is an honour to the body, that Jesus Christ was raised fromthe dead; and it will be an honour to our bodies, that they will beraised. The hope of a resurrection to glory, should keep Christiansfrom dishonouring their bodies by fleshly lusts. And if the soul beunited to Christ by faith, the whole man is become a member of hisspiritual body. Other vices may be conquered in fight; that herecautioned against, only by flight. And vast multitudes are cut off bythis vice in its various forms and consequences. Its effects fall notonly directly upon the body, but often upon the mind. Our bodies havebeen redeemed from deserved condemnation and hopeless slavery by theatoning sacrifice of Christ. We are to be clean, as vessels fitted forour Master's use. Being united to Christ as one spirit, and bought witha price of unspeakable value, the believer should consider himself aswholly the Lord's, by the strongest ties. May we make it our business,to the latest day and hour of our lives, to glorify God with ourbodies, and with our spirits which are his.
1Co 7:1-9	<br>The apostle tells the Corinthians that it was good, in that juncture oftime, for Christians to keep themselves single. Yet he says thatmarriage, and the comforts of that state, are settled by Divine wisdom.Though none may break the law of God, yet that perfect rule leaves menat liberty to serve him in the way most suited to their powers andcircumstances, of which others often are very unfit judges. All mustdetermine for themselves, seeking counsel from God how they ought toact.
1Co 7:10-16	<br>Man and wife must not separate for any other cause than what Christallows. Divorce, at that time, was very common among both Jews andGentiles, on very slight pretexts. Marriage is a Divine institution;and is an engagement for life, by God's appointment. We are bound, asmuch as in us lies, to live peaceably with all men, Ro 12:18, thereforeto promote the peace and comfort of our nearest relatives, thoughunbelievers. It should be the labour and study of those who aremarried, to make each other as easy and happy as possible. Should aChristian desert a husband or wife, when there is opportunity to givethe greatest proof of love? Stay, and labour heartily for theconversion of thy relative. In every state and relation the Lord hascalled us to peace; and every thing should be done to promote harmony,as far as truth and holiness will permit.
1Co 7:17-24	<br>The rules of Christianity reach every condition; and in every state aman may live so as to be a credit to it. It is the duty of everyChristian to be content with his lot, and to conduct himself in hisrank and place as becomes a Christian. Our comfort and happiness dependon what we are to Christ, not what we are in the world. No man shouldthink to make his faith or religion, an argument to break through anynatural or civil obligations. He should quietly and contentedly abidein the condition in which he is placed by Divine Providence.
1Co 7:25-35	<br>Considering the distress of those times, the unmarried state was best.Notwithstanding, the apostle does not condemn marriage. How oppositeare those to the apostle Paul who forbid many to marry, and entanglethem with vows to remain single, whether they ought to do so or not! Heexhorts all Christians to holy indifference toward the world. As torelations; they must not set their hearts on the comforts of the state.As to afflictions; they must not indulge the sorrow of the world: evenin sorrow the heart may be joyful. As to worldly enjoyments; here isnot their rest. As to worldly employment; those that prosper in trade,and increase in wealth, should hold their possessions as though theyheld them not. As to all worldly concerns; they must keep the world outof their hearts, that they may not abuse it when they have it in theirhands. All worldly things are show; nothing solid. All will be quicklygone. Wise concern about worldly interests is a duty; but to be full ofcare, to have anxious and perplexing care, is a sin. By this maxim theapostle solves the case whether it were advisable to marry. Thatcondition of life is best for every man, which is best for his soul,and keeps him most clear of the cares and snares of the world. Let usreflect on the advantages and snares of our own condition in life; thatwe may improve the one, and escape as far as possible all injury fromthe other. And whatever cares press upon the mind, let time still bekept for the things of the Lord.
1Co 7:36-40	<br>The apostle is thought to give advice here about the disposal ofchildren in marriage. In this view, the general meaning is plain.Children should seek and follow the directions of their parents as tomarriage. And parents should consult their children's wishes; and notreckon they have power to do with them, and dictate just as theyplease, without reason. The whole is closed with advice to widows.Second marriages are not unlawful, so that it is kept in mind, to marryin the Lord. In our choice of relations, and change of conditions, weshould always be guided by the fear of God, and the laws of God, andact in dependence on the providence of God. Change of condition oughtonly to be made after careful consideration, and on probable grounds,that it will be to advantage in our spiritual concerns.
1Co 8:1-6	<br>There is no proof of ignorance more common than conceit of knowledge.Much may be known, when nothing is known to good purpose. And those whothink they know any thing, and grow vain thereon, are the least likelyto make good use of their knowledge. Satan hurts some as much bytempting them to be proud of mental powers, as others, by alluring tosensuality. Knowledge which puffs up the possessor, and renders himconfident, is as dangerous as self-righteous pride, though what heknows may be right. Without holy affections all human knowledge isworthless. The heathens had gods of higher and lower degree; gods many,and lords many; so called, but not such in truth. Christians knowbetter. One God made all, and has power over all. The one God, even theFather, signifies the Godhead as the sole object of all religiousworship; and the Lord Jesus Christ denotes the person of Emmanuel, Godmanifest in the flesh, One with the Father, and with us; the appointedMediator, and Lord of all; through whom we come to the Father, andthrough whom the Father sends all blessings to us, by the influence andworking of the Holy Spirit. While we refuse all worship to the many whoare called gods and lords, and to saints and angels, let us try whetherwe really come to God by faith in Christ.
1Co 8:7-13	<br>Eating one kind of food, and abstaining from another, have nothing inthem to recommend a person to God. But the apostle cautions againstputting a stumbling-block in the way of the weak; lest they be madebold to eat what was offered to the idol, not as common food, but as asacrifice, and thereby be guilty of idolatry. He who has the Spirit ofChrist in him, will love those whom Christ loved so as to die for them.Injuries done to Christians, are done to Christ; but most of all, theentangling them in guilt: wounding their consciences, is wounding him.We should be very tender of doing any thing that may occasion stumblingto others, though it may be innocent in itself. And if we must notendanger other men's souls, how much should we take care not to destroyour own! Let Christians beware of approaching the brink of evil, or theappearance of it, though many do this in public matters, for whichperhaps they plead plausibly. Men cannot thus sin against theirbrethren, without offending Christ, and endangering their own souls.
1Co 9:1-14	<br>It is not new for a minister to meet with unkind returns for good-willto a people, and diligent and successful services among them. To thecavils of some, the apostle answers, so as to set forth himself as anexample of self-denial, for the good of others. He had a right to marryas well as other apostles, and to claim what was needful for his wife,and his children if he had any, from the churches, without labouringwith his own hands to get it. Those who seek to do our souls good,should have food provided for them. But he renounced his right, ratherthan hinder his success by claiming it. It is the people's duty tomaintain their minister. He may wave his right, as Paul did; but thosetransgress a precept of Christ, who deny or withhold due support.
1Co 9:15-23	<br>It is the glory of a minister to deny himself, that he may serve Christand save souls. But when a minister gives up his right for the sake ofthe gospel, he does more than his charge and office demands. Bypreaching the gospel, freely, the apostle showed that he acted fromprinciples of zeal and love, and thus enjoyed much comfort and hope inhis soul. And though he looked on the ceremonial law as a yoke takenoff by Christ, yet he submitted to it, that he might work upon theJews, do away their prejudices, prevail with them to hear the gospel,and win them over to Christ. Though he would transgress no laws ofChrist, to please any man, yet he would accommodate himself to all men,where he might do it lawfully, to gain some. Doing good was the studyand business of his life; and, that he might reach this end, he did notstand on privileges. We must carefully watch against extremes, andagainst relying on any thing but trust in Christ alone. We must notallow errors or faults, so as to hurt others, or disgrace the gospel.
1Co 9:24-27	<br>The apostle compares himself to the racers and combatants in theIsthmian games, well known by the Corinthians. But in the Christianrace all may run so as to obtain. There is the greatest encouragement,therefore, to persevere with all our strength, in this course. Thosewho ran in these games were kept to a spare diet. They used themselvesto hardships. They practised the exercises. And those who pursue theinterests of their souls, must combat hard with fleshly lusts. The bodymust not be suffered to rule. The apostle presses this advice on theCorinthians. He sets before himself and them the danger of yielding tofleshly desires, pampering the body, and its lusts and appetites. Holyfear of himself was needed to keep an apostle faithful: how much moreis it needful for our preservation! Let us learn from hence humilityand caution, and to watch against dangers which surround us while inthe body.
1Co 10:1-5	<br>To dissuade the Corinthians from communion with idolaters, and securityin any sinful course, the apostle sets before them the example of theJewish nation of old. They were, by a miracle, led through the Red Sea,where the pursuing Egyptians were drowned. It was to them a typicalbaptism. The manna on which they fed was a type of Christ crucified,the Bread which came down from heaven, which whoso eateth shall livefor ever. Christ is the Rock on which the Christian church is built;and of the streams that issue therefrom, all believers drink, and arerefreshed. It typified the sacred influences of the Holy Spirit, asgiven to believers through Christ. But let none presume upon theirgreat privileges, or profession of the truth; these will not secureheavenly happiness.
1Co 10:6-14	<br>Carnal desires gain strength by indulgence, therefore should be checkedin their first rise. Let us fear the sins of Israel, if we would shuntheir plagues. And it is but just to fear, that such as tempt Christ,will be left by him in the power of the old serpent. Murmuring againstGod's disposals and commands, greatly provokes him. Nothing inScripture is written in vain; and it is our wisdom and duty to learnfrom it. Others have fallen, and so may we. The Christian's securityagainst sin is distrust of himself. God has not promised to keep usfrom falling, if we do not look to ourselves. To this word of caution,a word of comfort is added. Others have the like burdens, and the liketemptations: what they bear up under, and break through, we may also.God is wise as well as faithful, and will make our burdens according toour strength. He knows what we can bear. He will make a way to escape;he will deliver either from the trial itself, or at least the mischiefof it. We have full encouragement to flee from sin, and to be faithfulto God. We cannot fall by temptation, if we cleave fast to him. Whetherthe world smiles or frowns, it is an enemy; but believers shall bestrengthened to overcome it, with all its terrors and enticements. Thefear of the Lord, put into their hearts, will be the great means ofsafety.
1Co 10:15-22	<br>Did not the joining in the Lord's supper show a profession of faith inChrist crucified, and of adoring gratitude to him for his salvation ?Christians, by this ordinance, and the faith therein professed, wereunited as the grains of wheat in one loaf of bread, or as the membersin the human body, seeing they were all united to Christ, and hadfellowship with him and one another. This is confirmed from the Jewishworship and customs in sacrifice. The apostle applies this to feastingwith idolaters. Eating food as part of a heathen sacrifice, wasworshipping the idol to whom it was made, and having fellowship orcommunion with it; just as he who eats the Lord's supper, is accountedto partake in the Christian sacrifice, or as they who ate the Jewishsacrifices partook of what was offered on their altar. It was denyingChristianity; for communion with Christ, and communion with devils,could never be had at once. If Christians venture into places, and joinin sacrifices to the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eye, and thepride of life, they will provoke God.
1Co 10:23-33	<br>There were cases wherein Christians might eat what had been offered toidols, without sin. Such as when the flesh was sold in the market ascommon food, for the priest to whom it had been given. But a Christianmust not merely consider what is lawful, but what is expedient, and toedify others. Christianity by no means forbids the common offices ofkindness, or allows uncourteous behaviour to any, however they maydiffer from us in religious sentiments or practices. But this is not tobe understood of religious festivals, partaking in idolatrous worship.According to this advice of the apostle, Christians should take carenot to use their liberty to the hurt of others, or to their ownreproach. In eating and drinking, and in all we do, we should aim atthe glory of God, at pleasing and honouring him. This is the great endof all religion, and directs us where express rules are wanting. Aholy, peaceable, and benevolent spirit, will disarm the greatestenemies.
1Co 11:2-16	<br>Here begin particulars respecting the public assemblies, ch. 1Co 14. Inthe abundance of spiritual gifts bestowed on the Corinthians, someabuses had crept in; but as Christ did the will, and sought the honourof God, so the Christian should avow his subjection to Christ, doinghis will and seeking his glory. We should, even in our dress and habit,avoid every thing that may dishonour Christ. The woman was made subjectto man, because made for his help and comfort. And she should donothing, in Christian assemblies, which looked like a claim of beingequal. She ought to have "power," that is, a veil, on her head, becauseof the angels. Their presence should keep Christians from all that iswrong while in the worship of God. Nevertheless, the man and the womanwere made for one another. They were to be mutual comforts andblessings, not one a slave, and the other a tyrant. God has so settledmatters, both in the kingdom of providence and that of grace, that theauthority and subjection of each party should be for mutual help andbenefit. It was the common usage of the churches, for women to appearin public assemblies, and join in public worship, veiled; and it wasright that they should do so. The Christian religion sanctions nationalcustoms wherever these are not against the great principles of truthand holiness; affected singularities receive no countenance from anything in the Bible.
1Co 11:17-22	<br>The apostle rebukes the disorders in their partaking of the Lord'ssupper. The ordinances of Christ, if they do not make us better, willbe apt to make us worse. If the use of them does not mend, it willharden. Upon coming together, they fell into divisions, schisms.Christians may separate from each other's communion, yet be charitableone towards another; they may continue in the same communion, yet beuncharitable. This last is schism, rather than the former. There is acareless and irregular eating of the Lord's supper, which adds toguilt. Many rich Corinthians seem to have acted very wrong at theLord's table, or at the love-feasts, which took place at the same timeas the supper. The rich despised the poor, and ate and drank up theprovisions they brought, before the poor were allowed to partake; thussome wanted, while others had more than enough. What should have been abond of mutual love and affection, was made an instrument of discordand disunion. We should be careful that nothing in our behaviour at theLord's table, appears to make light of that sacred institution. TheLord's supper is not now made an occasion for gluttony or revelling,but is it not often made the support of self-righteous pride, or acloak for hypocrisy? Let us never rest in the outward forms of worship;but look to our hearts.
1Co 11:23-34	<br>The apostle describes the sacred ordinance, of which he had theknowledge by revelation from Christ. As to the visible signs, these arethe bread and wine. What is eaten is called bread, though at the sametime it is said to be the body of the Lord, plainly showing that theapostle did not mean that the bread was changed into flesh. St. Matthewtells us, our Lord bid them all drink of the cup, ch. Mt 26:27, as ifhe would, by this expression, provide against any believer beingdeprived of the cup. The things signified by these outward signs, areChrist's body and blood, his body broken, his blood shed, together withall the benefits which flow from his death and sacrifice. Our Saviour'sactions were, taking the bread and cup, giving thanks, breaking thebread, and giving both the one and the other. The actions of thecommunicants were, to take the bread and eat, to take the cup anddrink, and to do both in remembrance of Christ. But the outward actsare not the whole, or the principal part, of what is to be done at thisholy ordinance. Those who partake of it, are to take him as their Lordand Life, yield themselves up to him, and live upon him. Here is anaccount of the ends of this ordinance. It is to be done in remembranceof Christ, to keep fresh in our minds his dying for us, as well as toremember Christ pleading for us, in virtue of his death, at God's righthand. It is not merely in remembrance of Christ, of what he has doneand suffered; but to celebrate his grace in our redemption. We declarehis death to be our life, the spring of all our comforts and hopes. Andwe glory in such a declaration; we show forth his death, and plead itas our accepted sacrifice and ransom. The Lord's supper is not anordinance to be observed merely for a time, but to be continued. Theapostle lays before the Corinthians the danger of receiving it with anunsuitable temper of mind; or keeping up the covenant with sin anddeath, while professing to renew and confirm the covenant with God. Nodoubt such incur great guilt, and so render themselves liable tospiritual judgements. But fearful believers should not be discouragedfrom attending at this holy ordinance. The Holy Spirit never causedthis scripture to be written to deter serious Christians from theirduty, though the devil has often made this use of it. The apostle wasaddressing Christians, and warning them to beware of the temporaljudgements with which God chastised his offending servants. And in themidst of judgement, God remembers mercy: he many times punishes thosewhom he loves. It is better to bear trouble in this world, than to bemiserable for ever. The apostle points our the duty of those who cometo the Lord's table. Self-examination is necessary to right attendanceat this holy ordinance. If we would thoroughly search ourselves, tocondemn and set right what we find wrong, we should stop Divinejudgements. The apostle closes all with a caution against theirregularities of which the Corinthians were guilty at the Lord'stable. Let all look to it, that they do not come together to God'sworship, so as to provoke him, and bring down vengeance on themselves.
1Co 12:1-11	<br>Spiritual gifts were extraordinary powers bestowed in the first ages,to convince unbelievers, and to spread the gospel. Gifts and gracesgreatly differ. Both were freely given of God. But where grace isgiven, it is for the salvation of those who have it. Gifts are for theadvantage and salvation of others; and there may be great gifts wherethere is no grace. The extraordinary gifts of the Holy Spirit werechiefly exercised in the public assemblies, where the Corinthians seemto have made displays of them, wanting in the spirit of piety, and ofChristian love. While heathens, they had not been influenced by theSpirit of Christ. No man can call Christ Lord, with believingdependence upon him, unless that faith is wrought by the Holy Ghost. Noman could believe with his heart, or prove by a miracle, that Jesus wasChrist, unless by the Holy Ghost. There are various gifts, and variousoffices to perform, but all proceed from one God, one Lord, one Spirit;that is, from the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, the origin of allspiritual blessings. No man has them merely for himself. The more heprofits others, the more will they turn to his own account. The giftsmentioned appear to mean exact understanding, and uttering thedoctrines of the Christian religion; the knowledge of mysteries, andskill to give advice and counsel. Also the gift of healing the sick,the working of miracles, and to explain Scripture by a peculiar gift ofthe Spirit, and ability to speak and interpret languages. If we haveany knowledge of the truth, or any power to make it known, we must giveall the glory of God. The greater the gifts are, the more the possessoris exposed to temptations, and the larger is the measure of graceneeded to keep him humble and spiritual; and he will meet with morepainful experiences and humbling dispensations. We have little cause toglory in any gifts bestowed on us, or to despise those who have themnot. (1Co 12:12-26)
1Co 12:12-26	<br>Christ and his church form one body, as Head and members. Christiansbecome members of this body by baptism. The outward rite is of Divineinstitution; it is a sign of the new birth, and is called therefore thewashing of regeneration, Tit 3:5. But it is by the Spirit, only by therenewing of the Holy Ghost, that we are made members of Christ's body.And by communion with Christ at the Lord's supper, we are strengthened,not by drinking the wine, but by drinking into one Spirit. Each memberhas its form, place, and use. The meanest makes a part of the body.There must be a distinction of members in the body. So Christ's membershave different powers and different places. We should do the duties ofour own place, and not murmur, or quarrel with others. All the membersof the body are useful and necessary to each other. Nor is there amember of the body of Christ, but may and ought to be useful tofellow-members. As in the natural body of man, the members should beclosely united by the strongest bonds of love; the good of the wholeshould be the object of all. All Christians are dependent one uponanother; each is to expect and receive help from the rest. Let us thenhave more of the spirit of union in our religion.
1Co 12:27-31	<br>Contempt, hatred, envy, and strife, are very unnatural in Christians.It is like the members of the same body being without concern for oneanother, or quarrelling with each other. The proud, contentious spiritthat prevailed, as to spiritual gifts, was thus condemned. The officesand gifts, or favours, dispensed by the Holy Spirit, are noticed. Chiefministers; persons enabled to interpret Scripture; those who labouredin word and doctrine; those who had power to heal diseases; such ashelped the sick and weak; such as disposed of the money given incharity by the church, and managed the affairs of the church; and suchas could speak divers languages. What holds the last and lowest rank inthis list, is the power to speak languages; how vain, if a man does somerely to amuse or to exalt himself! See the distribution of thesegifts, not to every one alike, 
1Co 12:29,30). This were to make thechurch all one, as if the body were all ear, or all eye. The Spiritdistributes to every one as he will. We must be content though we arelower and less than others. We must not despise others, if we havegreater gifts. How blessed the Christian church, if all the members didtheir duty! Instead of coveting the highest stations, or the mostsplendid gifts, let us leave the appointment of his instruments to God,and those in whom he works by his providence. Remember, those will notbe approved hereafter who seek the chief places, but those who are mostfaithful to the trust placed in them, and most diligent in theirMaster's work.	
1Co 13:1-3	<br>The excellent way had in view in the close of the former chapter, isnot what is meant by charity in our common use of the word, almsgiving,but love in its fullest meaning; true love to God and man. Withoutthis, the most glorious gifts are of no account to us, of no esteem inthe sight of God. A clear head and a deep understanding, are of novalue without a benevolent and charitable heart. There may be an openand lavish hand, where there is not a liberal and charitable heart.Doing good to others will do none to us, if it be not done from love toGod, and good-will to men. If we give away all we have, while wewithhold the heart from God, it will not profit. Nor even the mostpainful sufferings. How are those deluded who look for acceptance andreward for their good works, which are as scanty and defective as theyare corrupt and selfish!
1Co 13:4-7	<br>Some of the effects of charity are stated, that we may know whether wehave this grace; and that if we have not, we may not rest till we haveit. This love is a clear proof of regeneration, and is a touchstone ofour professed faith in Christ. In this beautiful description of thenature and effects of love, it is meant to show the Corinthians thattheir conduct had, in many respects, been a contrast to it. Charity isan utter enemy to selfishness; it does not desire or seek its ownpraise, or honour, or profit, or pleasure. Not that charity destroysall regard to ourselves, or that the charitable man should neglecthimself and all his interests. But charity never seeks its own to thehurt of others, or to neglect others. It ever prefers the welfare ofothers to its private advantage. How good-natured and amiable isChristian charity! How excellent would Christianity appear to theworld, if those who profess it were more under this Divine principle,and paid due regard to the command on which its blessed Author laid thechief stress! Let us ask whether this Divine love dwells in our hearts.Has this principle guided us into becoming behaviour to all men? Are wewilling to lay aside selfish objects and aims? Here is a call towatchfulness, diligence, and prayer.
1Co 13:8-13	<br>Charity is much to be preferred to the gifts on which the Corinthiansprided themselves. From its longer continuance. It is a grace, lastingas eternity. The present state is a state of childhood, the future thatof manhood. Such is the difference between earth and heaven. Whatnarrow views, what confused notions of things, have children whencompared with grown men! Thus shall we think of our most valued giftsof this world, when we come to heaven. All things are dark and confusednow, compared with what they will be hereafter. They can only be seenas by the reflection in a mirror, or in the description of a riddle;but hereafter our knowledge will be free from all obscurity and error.It is the light of heaven only, that will remove all clouds anddarkness that hide the face of God from us. To sum up the excellencesof charity, it is preferred not only to gifts, but to other graces, tofaith and hope. Faith fixes on the Divine revelation, and assentsthereto, relying on the Divine Redeemer. Hope fastens on futurehappiness, and waits for that; but in heaven, faith will be swallowedup in actual sight, and hope in enjoyment. There is no room to believeand hope, when we see and enjoy. But there, love will be made perfect.There we shall perfectly love God. And there we shall perfectly loveone another. Blessed state! how much surpassing the best below! God islove, 1Jo 4:8,16. Where God is to be seen as he is, and face to face,there charity is in its greatest height; there only will it beperfected.
1Co 14:1-5	<br>Prophesying, that is, explaining Scripture, is compared with speakingwith tongues. This drew attention, more than the plain interpretationof Scripture; it gratified pride more, but promoted the purposes ofChristian charity less; it would not equally do good to the souls ofmen. What cannot be understood, never can edify. No advantage can bereaped from the most excellent discourses, if delivered in languagesuch as the hearers cannot speak or understand. Every ability orpossession is valuable in proportion to its usefulness. Even fervent,spiritual affection must be governed by the exercise of theunderstanding, else men will disgrace the truths they profess topromote.
1Co 14:6-14	<br>Even an apostle could not edify, unless he spoke so as to be understoodby his hearers. To speak words that have no meaning to those who hearthem, is but speaking into the air. That cannot answer the end ofspeaking, which has no meaning; in this case, speaker and hearers arebarbarians to each other. All religious services should be so performedin Christian assemblies, that all may join in, and profit by them.Language plain and easy to be understood, is the most proper for publicworship, and other religious exercises. Every true follower of Christwill rather desire to do good to others, than to get a name forlearning or fine speaking.
1Co 14:15-25	<br>There can be no assent to prayers that are not understood. A trulyChristian minister will seek much more to do spiritual good to men'ssouls, than to get the greatest applause to himself. This is provinghimself the servant of Christ. Children are apt to be struck withnovelty; but do not act like them. Christians should be like children,void of guile and malice; yet they should not be unskilful as to theword of righteousness, but only as to the arts of mischief. It is aproof that a people are forsaken of God, when he gives them up to therule of those who teach them to worship in another language. They cannever be benefitted by such teaching. Yet thus the preachers did whodelivered their instructions in an unknown tongue. Would it not makeChristianity ridiculous to a heathen, to hear the ministers pray orpreach in a language which neither he nor the assembly understood? Butif those who minister, plainly interpret Scripture, or preach the greattruths and rules of the gospel, a heathen or unlearned person mightbecome a convert to Christianity. His conscience might be touched, thesecrets of his heart might be revealed to him, and so he might bebrought to confess his guilt, and to own that God was present in theassembly. Scripture truth, plainly and duly taught, has a wonderfulpower to awaken the conscience and touch the heart.
1Co 14:26-33	<br>Religious exercises in public assemblies should have this view; Let allbe done to edifying. As to the speaking in an unknown tongue, ifanother were present who could interpret, two miraculous gifts might beexercised at once, and thereby the church be edified, and the faith ofthe hearers confirmed at the same time. As to prophesying, two or threeonly should speak at one meeting, and this one after the other, not allat once. The man who is inspired by the Spirit of God will observeorder and decency in delivering his revelations. God never teaches mento neglect their duties, or to act in any way unbecoming their age orstation.
1Co 14:34-40	<br>When the apostle exhorts Christian women to seek information onreligious subjects from their husbands at home, it shows that believingfamilies ought to assemble for promoting spiritual knowledge. TheSpirit of Christ can never contradict itself; and if their revelationsare against those of the apostle, they do not come from the sameSpirit. The way to keep peace, truth, and order in the church, is toseek that which is good for it, to bear with that which is not hurtfulto its welfare, and to keep up good behaviour, order, and decency.
1Co 15:1-11	<br>The word resurrection, usually points out our existence beyond thegrave. Of the apostle's doctrine not a trace can be found in all theteaching of philosophers. The doctrine of Christ's death andresurrection, is the foundation of Christianity. Remove this, and allour hopes for eternity sink at once. And it is by holding this truthfirm, that Christians stand in the day of trial, and are kept faithfulto God. We believe in vain, unless we keep in the faith of the gospel.This truth is confirmed by Old Testament prophecies; and many sawChrist after he was risen. This apostle was highly favoured, but healways had a low opinion of himself, and expressed it. When sinnersare, by Divine grace, turned into saints, God causes the remembrance offormer sins to make them humble, diligent, and faithful. He ascribes toDivine grace all that was valuable in him. True believers, though notignorant of what the Lord has done for, in, and by them, yet when theylook at their whole conduct and their obligations, they are led to feelthat none are so worthless as they are. All true Christians believethat Jesus Christ, and him crucified, and then risen from the dead, isthe sun and substance of Christianity. All the apostles agreed in thistestimony; by this faith they lived, and in this faith they died.
1Co 15:12-19	<br>Having shown that Christ was risen, the apostle answers those who saidthere would be no resurrection. There had been no justification, orsalvation, if Christ had not risen. And must not faith in Christ bevain, and of no use, if he is still among the dead? The proof of theresurrection of the body is the resurrection of our Lord. Even thosewho died in the faith, had perished in their sins, if Christ had notrisen. All who believe in Christ, have hope in him, as a Redeemer; hopefor redemption and salvation by him; but if there is no resurrection,or future recompence, their hope in him can only be as to this life.And they must be in a worse condition than the rest of mankind,especially at the time, and under the circumstances, in which theapostles wrote; for then Christians were hated and persecuted by allmen. But it is not so; they, of all men, enjoy solid comforts amidstall their difficulties and trials, even in the times of the sharpestpersecution.
1Co 15:20-34	<br>All that are by faith united to Christ, are by his resurrection assuredof their own. As through the sin of the first Adam, all men becamemortal, because all had from him the same sinful nature, so, throughthe resurrection of Christ, shall all who are made to partake of theSpirit, and the spiritual nature, revive, and live for ever. There willbe an order in the resurrection. Christ himself has been thefirst-fruits; at his coming, his redeemed people will be raised beforeothers; at the last the wicked will rise also. Then will be the end ofthis present state of things. Would we triumph in that solemn andimportant season, we must now submit to his rule, accept his salvation,and live to his glory. Then shall we rejoice in the completion of hisundertaking, that God may receive the whole glory of our salvation,that we may for ever serve him, and enjoy his favour. What shall thosedo, who are baptized for the dead, if the dead rise not at all? Perhapsbaptism is used here in a figure, for afflictions, sufferings, andmartyrdom, as Mt 20:22,23. What is, or will become of those who havesuffered many and great injuries, and have even lost their lives, forthis doctrine of the resurrection, if the dead rise not at all?Whatever the meaning may be, doubtless the apostle's argument wasunderstood by the Corinthians. And it is as plain to us thatChristianity would be a foolish profession, if it proposed advantage tothemselves by their faithfulness to God; and to have our fruit toholiness, that our end may be everlasting life. But we must not livelike beasts, as we do not die like them. It must be ignorance of Godthat leads any to disbelieve the resurrection and future life. Thosewho own a God and a providence, and observe how unequal things are inthe present life, how frequently the best men fare worst, cannot doubtas to an after-state, where every thing will be set to rights. Let usnot be joined with ungodly men; but warn all around us, especiallychildren and young persons, to shun them as a pestilence. Let us awaketo righteousness, and not sin.
1Co 15:35-50	<br>1. How are the dead raised up? that is, by what means? How can they beraised? 2. As to the bodies which shall rise. Will it be with the likeshape, and form, and stature, and members, and qualities? The formerobjection is that of those who opposed the doctrine, the latter ofcurious doubters. To the first the answer is, This was to be broughtabout by Divine power; that power which all may see does somewhat likeit, year after year, in the death and revival of the corn. It isfoolish to question the Almighty power of God to raise the dead, whenwe see it every day quickening and reviving things that are dead. Tothe second inquiry; The grain undergoes a great change; and so will thedead, when they rise and live again. The seed dies, though a part of itsprings into new life, though how it is we cannot fully understand. Theworks of creation and providence daily teach us to be humble, as wellas to admire the Creator's wisdom and goodness. There is a greatvariety among other bodies, as there is among plants. There is avariety of glory among heavenly bodies. The bodies of the dead, whenthey rise, will be fitted for the heavenly bodies. The bodies of thedead, when they rise, will be fitted for the heavenly state; and therewill be a variety of glories among them. Burying the dead, is likecommitting seed to the earth, that it may spring out of it again.Nothing is more loathsome than a dead body. But believers shall at theresurrection have bodies, made fit to be for ever united with spiritsmade perfect. To God all things are possible. He is the Author andSource of spiritual life and holiness, unto all his people, by thesupply of his Holy Spirit to the soul; and he will also quicken andchange the body by his Spirit. The dead in Christ shall not only rise,but shall rise thus gloriously changed. The bodies of the saints, whenthey rise again, will be changed. They will be then glorious andspiritual bodies, fitted to the heavenly world and state, where theyare ever afterwards to dwell. The human body in its present form, andwith its wants and weaknesses, cannot enter or enjoy the kingdom ofGod. Then let us not sow to the flesh, of which we can only reapcorruption. And the body follows the state of the soul. He, therefore,who neglects the life of the soul, casts away his present good; he whorefuses to live to God, squanders all he has.
1Co 15:51-58	<br>All the saints should not die, but all would be changed. In the gospel,many truths, before hidden in mystery, are made known. Death nevershall appear in the regions to which our Lord will bear his risensaints. Therefore let us seek the full assurance of faith and hope,that in the midst of pain, and in the prospect of death, we may thinkcalmly on the horrors of the tomb; assured that our bodies will theresleep, and in the mean time our souls will be present with theRedeemer. Sin gives death all its hurtful power. The sting of death issin; but Christ, by dying, has taken out this sting; he has madeatonement for sin, he has obtained remission of it. The strength of sinis the law. None can answer its demands, endure its curse, or do awayhis own transgressions. Hence terror and anguish. And hence death isterrible to the unbelieving and the impenitent. Death may seize abeliever, but it cannot hold him in its power. How many springs of joyto the saints, and of thanksgiving to God, are opened by the death andresurrection, the sufferings and conquests of the Redeemer! In verse#(58), we have an exhortation, that believers should be stedfast, firmin the faith of that gospel which the apostle preached, and theyreceived. Also, to be unmovable in their hope and expectation of thisgreat privilege, of being raised incorruptible and immortal. And toabound in the work of the Lord, always doing the Lord's service, andobeying the Lord's commands. May Christ give us faith, and increase ourfaith, that we may not only be safe, but joyful and triumphant.
1Co 16:1-9	<br>The good examples of other Christians and churches should rouse us. Itis good to lay up in store for good uses. Those who are rich in thisworld, should be rich in good works, 1Ti 6:17,18. The diligent handwill not make rich, without the Divine blessing, Pr 10:4,22. And whatmore proper to stir us up to charity to the people and children of God,than to look at all we have as his gift? Works of mercy are real fruitsof true love to God, and are therefore proper services on his own day.Ministers are doing their proper business, when putting forward, orhelping works of charity. The heart of a Christian minister must betowards the people among whom he has laboured long, and with success.All our purposes must be made with submission to the Divine providence,Jas 4:15. Adversaries and opposition do not break the spirits offaithful and successful ministers, but warm their zeal, and inspirethem with fresh courage. A faithful minister is more discouraged by thehardness of his hearers' hearts, and the backslidings of professors,than by the enemies' attempts.
1Co 16:10-12	<br>Timothy came to do the work of the Lord. Therefore to vex his spirit,would be to grieve the Holy Spirit; to despise him, would be to despiseHim that sent him. Those who work the work of the Lord, should betreated with tenderness and respect. Faithful ministers will not bejealous of each other. It becomes the ministers of the gospel to showconcern for each other's reputation and usefulness.
1Co 16:13-18	<br>A Christian is always in danger, therefore should ever be on the watch.He should be fixed in the faith of the gospel, and never desert or giveit up. By this faith alone he will be able to keep his ground in anhour of temptation. Christians should be careful that charity not onlyreigns in their hearts, but shines in their lives. There is a greatdifference between Christian firmness and feverish warmth andtransport. The apostle gave particular directions as to some who servedthe cause of Christ among them. Those who serve the saints, those whodesire the honour of the churches, and to remove reproaches from them,are to be thought much of, and loved. They should willingly acknowledgethe worth of such, and all who laboured with or helped the apostle.
1Co 16:19-24	<br>Christianity by no means destroys civility. Religion should promote acourteous and obliging temper towards all. Those give a false idea ofreligion, and reproach it, who would take encouragement from it to besour and morose. And Christian salutations are not mere emptycompliments; but are real expressions of good-will to others, andcommend them to the Divine grace and blessing. Every Christian familyshould be as a Christian church. Wherever two or three are gatheredtogether in the name of Christ, and he is among them, there is achurch. Here is a solemn warning. Many who have Christ's name much intheir mouths, have no true love to him in their hearts. None love himin truth, who do not love his laws, and keep his commandments. Many areChristians in name, who do not love Christ Jesus the Lord in sincerity.Such are separated from the people of God, and the favour of God. Thosewho love not the Lord Jesus Christ, must perish without remedy. Let usnot rest in any religious profession where there is not the love ofChrist, earnest desires for his salvation, gratitude for his mercies,and obedience to his commandments. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christhas in it all that is good, for time and for eternity. To wish that ourfriends may have this grace with them, is wishing them the utmost good.And this we should wish all our friends and brethren in Christ. We canwish them nothing greater, and we should wish them nothing less. TrueChristianity makes us wish those whom we love, the blessings of bothworlds; this is meant in wishing the grace of Christ to be with them.The apostle had dealt plainly with the Corinthians, and told them oftheir faults with just severity; but he parts in love, and with asolemn profession of his love to them for Christ's sake. May our lovebe with all who are in Christ Jesus. Let us try whether all thingsappear worthless to us, when compared with Christ and hisrighteousness. Do we allow ourselves in any known sin, or in theneglect of any known duty? By such inquiries, faithfully made, we mayjudge of the state of our souls.
2Co 1:1-11	<br>We are encouraged to come boldly to the throne of grace, that we mayobtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need. The Lord is ableto give peace to the troubled conscience, and to calm the ragingpassions of the soul. These blessings are given by him, as the Fatherof his redeemed family. It is our Saviour who says, Let not your heartbe troubled. All comforts come from God, and our sweetest comforts arein him. He speaks peace to souls by granting the free remission ofsins; and he comforts them by the enlivening influences of the HolySpirit, and by the rich mercies of his grace. He is able to bind up thebroken-hearted, to heal the most painful wounds, and also to give hopeand joy under the heaviest sorrows. The favours God bestows on us, arenot only to make us cheerful, but also that we may be useful to others.He sends comforts enough to support such as simply trust in and servehim. If we should be brought so low as to despair even of life, yet wemay then trust God, who can bring back even from death. Their hope andtrust were not in vain; nor shall any be ashamed who trust in the Lord.Past experiences encourage faith and hope, and lay us under obligationto trust in God for time to come. And it is our duty, not only to helpone another with prayer, but in praise and thanksgiving, and thereby tomake suitable returns for benefits received. Thus both trials andmercies will end in good to ourselves and others.
2Co 1:12-14	<br>Though, as a sinner, the apostle could only rejoice and glory in ChristJesus, yet, as a believer, he might rejoice and glory in being reallywhat he professed. Conscience witnesses concerning the steady courseand tenor of the life. Thereby we may judge ourselves, and not by thisor by that single act. Our conversation will be well ordered, when welive and act under such a gracious principle in the heart. Having this,we may leave our characters in the Lord's hands, but using proper meansto clear them, when the credit of the gospel, or our usefulness, callsfor it.
2Co 1:15-24	<br>The apostle clears himself from the charge of levity and inconstancy,in not coming to Corinth. Good men should be careful to keep thereputation of sincerity and constancy; they should not resolve, but oncareful thought; and they will not change unless for weighty reasons.Nothing can render God's promises more certain: his giving them throughChrist, assures us they are his promises; as the wonders God wrought inthe life, resurrection, and ascension of his Son, confirm faith. TheHoly Spirit makes Christians firm in the faith of the gospel: thequickening of the Spirit is an earnest of everlasting life; and thecomforts of the Spirit are an earnest of everlasting joy. The apostledesired to spare the blame he feared would be unavoidable, if he hadgone to Corinth before he learned what effect his former letterproduced. Our strength and ability are owing to faith; and our comfortand joy must flow from faith. The holy tempers and gracious fruitswhich attend faith, secure from delusion in so important a matter.
2Co 2:1-4	<br>The apostle desired to have a cheerful meeting with them; and he hadwritten in confidence of their doing what was to their benefit and hiscomfort; and that therefore they would be glad to remove every cause ofdisquiet from him. We should always give pain unwillingly, even whenduty requires that it must be given.
2Co 2:5-11	<br>The apostle desires them to receive the person who had done wrong,again into their communion; for he was aware of his fault, and muchafflicted under his punishment. Even sorrow for sin should not unfitfor other duties, and drive to despair. Not only was there danger lastSatan should get advantage, by tempting the penitent to hard thoughtsof God and religion, and so drive him to despair; but against thechurches and the ministers of Christ, by bringing an evil report uponChristians as unforgiving; thus making divisions, and hindering thesuccess of the ministry. In this, as in other things, wisdom is to beused, that the ministry may not be blamed for indulging sin on the onehand, or for too great severity towards sinners on the other hand.Satan has many plans to deceive, and knows how to make a bad use of ourmistakes.
2Co 2:12-17	<br>A believer's triumphs are all in Christ. To him be the praise and gloryof all, while the success of the gospel is a good reason for aChristian's joy and rejoicing. In ancient triumphs, abundance ofperfumes and sweet odours were used; so the name and salvation ofJesus, as ointment poured out, was a sweet savour diffused in everyplace. Unto some, the gospel is a savour of death unto death. Theyreject it to their ruin. Unto others, the gospel is a savour of lifeunto life: as it quickened them at first when they were dead intrespasses and sins, so it makes them more lively, and will end ineternal life. Observe the awful impressions this matter made upon theapostle, and should also make upon us. The work is great, and ofourselves we have no strength at all; all our sufficiency is of God.But what we do in religion, unless it is done in sincerity, as in thesight of God, is not of God, does not come from him, and will not reachto him. May we carefully watch ourselves in this matter; and seek thetestimony of our consciences, under the teaching of the Holy Spirit,that as of sincerity, so speak we in Christ and of Christ.
2Co 3:1-11	<br>Even the appearance of self-praise and courting human applause, ispainful to the humble and spiritual mind. Nothing is more delightful tofaithful ministers, or more to their praise, than the success of theirministry, as shown in the spirits and lives of those among whom theylabour. The law of Christ was written in their hearts, and the love ofChrist shed abroad there. Nor was it written in tables of stone, as thelaw of God given to Moses, but on the fleshy (not fleshly, asfleshliness denotes sensuality) tables of the heart, Eze 36:26. Theirhearts were humbled and softened to receive this impression, by thenew-creating power of the Holy Spirit. He ascribes all the glory toGod. And remember, as our whole dependence is upon the Lord, so thewhole glory belongs to him alone. The letter killeth: the letter of thelaw is the ministration of death; and if we rest only in the letter ofthe gospel, we shall not be the better for so doing: but the HolySpirit gives life spiritual, and life eternal. The Old Testamentdispensation was the ministration of death, but the New Testament oflife. The law made known sin, and the wrath and curse of God; it showedus a God above us, and a God against us; but the gospel makes knowngrace, and Emmanuel, God with us. Therein the righteousness of God byfaith is revealed; and this shows us that the just shall live by hisfaith; this makes known the grace and mercy of God through JesusChrist, for obtaining the forgiveness of sins and eternal life. Thegospel so much exceeds the law in glory, that it eclipses the glory ofthe legal dispensation. But even the New Testament will be a killingletter, if shown as a mere system or form, and without dependence onGod the Holy Spirit, to give it a quickening power.
2Co 3:12-18	<br>It is the duty of the ministers of the gospel to use great plainness,or clearness, of speech. The Old Testament believers had only cloudyand passing glimpses of that glorious Saviour, and unbelievers lookedno further than to the outward institution. But the great precepts ofthe gospel, believe, love, obey, are truths stated as clearly aspossible. And the whole doctrine of Christ crucified, is made as plainas human language can make it. Those who lived under the law, had aveil upon their hearts. This veil is taken away by the doctrines of theBible about Christ. When any person is converted to God, then the veilof ignorance is taken away. The condition of those who enjoy andbelieve the gospel is happy, for the heart is set at liberty to run theways of God's commandments. They have light, and with open face theybehold the glory of the Lord. Christians should prize and improve theseprivileges. We should not rest contented without knowing thetransforming power of the gospel, by the working of the Spirit,bringing us to seek to be like the temper and tendency of the gloriousgospel of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, and into union with Him.We behold Christ, as in the glass of his word; and as the reflectionfrom a mirror causes the face to shine, the faces of Christians shinealso.
2Co 4:1-7	<br>The best of men would faint, if they did not receive mercy from God.And that mercy which has helped us out, and helped us on, hitherto, wemay rely upon to help us even to the end. The apostles had no base andwicked designs, covered with fair and specious pretences. They did nottry to make their ministry serve a turn. Sincerity or uprightness willkeep the favourable opinion of wise and good men. Christ by his gospelmakes a glorious discovery to the minds of men. But the design of thedevil is, to keep men in ignorance; and when he cannot keep the lightof the gospel of Christ out of the world, he spares no pains to keepmen from the gospel, or to set them against it. The rejection of thegospel is here traced to the wilful blindness and wickedness of thehuman heart. Self was not the matter or the end of the apostles'preaching; they preached Christ as Jesus, the Saviour and Deliverer,who saves to the uttermost all that come to God through him. Ministersare servants to the souls of men; they must avoid becoming servants tothe humours or the lusts of men. It is pleasant to behold the sun inthe firmament; but it is more pleasant and profitable for the gospel toshine in the heart. As light was the beginning of the first creation;so, in the new creation, the light of the Spirit is his first work uponthe soul. The treasure of gospel light and grace is put into earthenvessels. The ministers of the gospel are subject to the same passionsand weaknesses as other men. God could have sent angels to make knownthe glorious doctrine of the gospel, or could have sent the mostadmired sons of men to teach the nations, but he chose humbler, weakervessels, that his power might be more glorified in upholding them, andin the blessed change wrought by their ministry.
2Co 4:8-12	<br>The apostles were great sufferers, yet they met with wonderful support.Believers may be forsaken of their friends, as well as persecuted byenemies; but their God will never leave them nor forsake them. Theremay be fears within, as well as fightings without; yet we are notdestroyed. The apostle speaks of their sufferings as a counterpart ofthe sufferings of Christ, that people might see the power of Christ'sresurrection, and of grace in and from the living Jesus. In comparisonwith them, other Christians were, even at that time, in prosperouscircumstances.
2Co 4:13-18	<br>The grace of faith is an effectual remedy against fainting in times oftrouble. They knew that Christ was raised, and that his resurrectionwas an earnest and assurance of theirs. The hope of this resurrectionwill encourage in a suffering day, and set us above the fear of death.Also, their sufferings were for the advantage of the church, and toGod's glory. The sufferings of Christ's ministers, as well as theirpreaching and conversation, are for the good of the church and theglory of God. The prospect of eternal life and happiness was theirsupport and comfort. What sense was ready to pronounce heavy and long,grievous and tedious, faith perceived to be light and short, and butfor a moment. The weight of all temporal afflictions was lightnessitself, while the glory to come was a substance, weighty, and lastingbeyond description. If the apostle could call his heavy andlong-continued trials light, and but for a moment, what must ourtrifling difficulties be! Faith enables to make this right judgment ofthings. There are unseen things, as well as things that are seen. Andthere is this vast difference between them; unseen things are eternal,seen things but temporal, or temporary only. Let us then look off fromthe things which are seen; let us cease to seek for worldly advantages,or to fear present distresses. Let us give diligence to make our futurehappiness sure.
2Co 5:1-8	<br>The believer not only is well assured by faith that there is anotherand a happy life after this is ended, but he has good hope, throughgrace, of heaven as a dwelling-place, a resting-place, a hiding-place.In our Father's house there are many mansions, whose Builder and Makeris God. The happiness of the future state is what God has prepared forthose that love him: everlasting habitations, not like the earthlytabernacles, the poor cottages of clay, in which our souls now dwell;that are mouldering and decaying, whose foundations are in the dust.The body of flesh is a heavy burden, the calamities of life are a heavyload. But believers groan, being burdened with a body of sin, andbecause of the many corruptions remaining and raging within them. Deathwill strip us of the clothing of flesh, and all the comforts of life,as well as end all our troubles here below. But believing souls shallbe clothed with garments of praise, with robes of righteousness andglory. The present graces and comforts of the Spirit are earnests ofeverlasting grace and comfort. And though God is with us here, by hisSpirit, and in his ordinances, yet we are not with him as we hope tobe. Faith is for this world, and sight is for the other world. It isour duty, and it will be our interest, to walk by faith, till we liveby sight. This shows clearly the happiness to be enjoyed by the soulsof believers when absent from the body, and where Jesus makes known hisglorious presence. We are related to the body and to the Lord; eachclaims a part in us. But how much more powerfully the Lord pleads forhaving the soul of the believer closely united with himself! Thou artone of the souls I have loved and chosen; one of those given to me.What is death, as an object of fear, compared with being absent fromthe Lord!
2Co 5:9-15	<br>The apostle quickens himself and others to acts of duty. Well-groundedhopes of heaven will not encourage sloth and sinful security. Let allconsider the judgment to come, which is called, The terror of the Lord.Knowing what terrible vengeance the Lord would execute upon the workersof iniquity, the apostle and his brethren used every argument andpersuasion, to lead men to believe in the Lord Jesus, and to act as hisdisciples. Their zeal and diligence were for the glory of God and thegood of the church. Christ's love to us will have a like effect uponus, if duly considered and rightly judged. All were lost and undone,dead and ruined, slaves to sin, having no power to deliver themselves,and must have remained thus miserable for ever, if Christ had not died.We should not make ourselves, but Christ, the end of our living andactions. A Christian's life should be devoted to Christ. Alas, how manyshow the worthlessness of their professed faith and love, by living tothemselves and to the world!
2Co 5:16-21	<br>The renewed man acts upon new principles, by new rules, with new ends,and in new company. The believer is created anew; his heart is notmerely set right, but a new heart is given him. He is the workmanshipof God, created in Christ Jesus unto good works. Though the same as aman, he is changed in his character and conduct. These words must anddo mean more than an outward reformation. The man who formerly saw nobeauty in the Saviour that he should desire him, now loves him aboveall things. The heart of the unregenerate is filled with enmity againstGod, and God is justly offended with him. Yet there may bereconciliation. Our offended God has reconciled us to himself by JesusChrist. By the inspiration of God, the Scriptures were written, whichare the word of reconciliation; showing that peace has been made by thecross, and how we may be interested therein. Though God cannot lose bythe quarrel, nor gain by the peace, yet he beseeches sinners to layaside their enmity, and accept the salvation he offers. Christ knew nosin. He was made Sin; not a sinner, but Sin, a Sin-offering, aSacrifice for sin. The end and design of all this was, that we might bemade the righteousness of God in him, might be justified freely by thegrace of God through the redemption which is in Christ Jesus. Can anylose, labour, or suffer too much for Him, who gave his beloved Son tobe the Sacrifice for their sins, that they might be made therighteousness of God in him?
2Co 6:1-10	<br>The gospel is a word of grace sounding in our ears. The gospel day is aday of salvation, the means of grace the means of salvation, the offersof the gospel the offers of salvation, and the present time the propertime to accept these offers. The morrow is none of ours: we know notwhat will be on the morrow, nor where we shall be. We now enjoy a dayof grace; then let all be careful not to neglect it. Ministers of thegospel should look upon themselves as God's servants, and act in everything suitably to that character. The apostle did so, by much patiencein afflictions, by acting from good principles, and by due temper andbehaviour. Believers, in this world, need the grace of God, to arm themagainst temptations, so as to bear the good report of men withoutpride; and so as to bear their reproaches with patience. They havenothing in themselves, but possess all things in Christ. Of suchdifferences is a Christian's life made up, and through such a varietyof conditions and reports, is our way to heaven; and we should becareful in all things to approve ourselves to God. The gospel, whenfaithfully preached, and fully received, betters the condition even ofthe poorest. They save what before they riotously spent, and diligentlyemploy their time to useful purposes. They save and gain by religion,and thus are made rich, both for the world to come and for this, whencompared with their sinful, profligate state, before they received thegospel.
2Co 6:11-18	<br>It is wrong for believers to join with the wicked and profane. The wordunbeliever applies to all destitute of true faith. True pastors willcaution their beloved children in the gospel, not to be unequallyyoked. The fatal effects of neglecting Scripture precepts as tomarriages clearly appear. Instead of a help meet, the union brings asnare. Those whose cross it is to be unequally united, without theirwilful fault, may expect consolation under it; but when believers enterinto such unions, against the express warnings of God's word, they mustexpect must distress. The caution also extends to common conversation.We should not join in friendship and acquaintance with wicked men andunbelievers. Though we cannot wholly avoid seeing and hearing, andbeing with such, yet we should never choose them for friends. We mustnot defile ourselves by converse with those who defile themselves withsin. Come out from the workers of iniquity, and separate from theirvain and sinful pleasures and pursuits; from all conformity to thecorruptions of this present evil world. If it be an envied privilege tobe the son or daughter of an earthly prince, who can express thedignity and happiness of being sons and daughters of the Almighty?
2Co 7:1-4	<br>The promises of God are strong reasons for us to follow after holiness;we must cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of flesh and spirit. Ifwe hope in God as our Father, we must seek to be holy as he is holy,and perfect as our Father in heaven. His grace, by the influences ofhis Spirit, alone can purify, but holiness should be the object of ourconstant prayers. If the ministers of the gospel are thoughtcontemptible, there is danger lest the gospel itself be despised also;and though ministers must flatter none, yet they must be gentle towardsall. Ministers may look for esteem and favour, when they can safelyappeal to the people, that they have corrupted no man by falsedoctrines or flattering speeches; that they have defrauded no man; norsought to promote their own interests so as to hurt any. It wasaffection to them made the apostle speak so freely to them, and causedhim to glory of them, in all places, and upon all occasions.
2Co 7:5-11	<br>There were fightings without, or continual contentions with, andopposition from Jews and Gentiles; and there were fears within, andgreat concern for such as had embraced the Christian faith. But Godcomforts those who are cast down. We should look above and beyond allmeans and instruments, to God, as the author of all the consolation andgood we enjoy. Sorrow according to the will of God, tending to theglory of God, and wrought by the Spirit of God, renders the hearthumble, contrite, submissive, disposed to mortify every sin, and towalk in newness of life. And this repentance is connected with savingfaith in Christ, and an interest in his atonement. There is a greatdifference between this sorrow of a godly sort, and the sorrow of theworld. The happy fruits of true repentance are mentioned. Where theheart is changed, the life and actions will be changed. It wroughtindignation at sin, at themselves, at the tempter and his instruments.It wrought a fear of watchfulness, and a cautious fear of sin. Itwrought desire to be reconciled with God. It wrought zeal for duty, andagainst sin. It wrought revenge against sin and their own folly, byendeavours to make satisfaction for injuries done thereby. Deephumility before God, hatred of all sin, with faith in Christ, a newheart and a new life, make repentance unto salvation. May the Lordbestow it on every one of us.
2Co 7:12-16	<br>The apostle was not disappointed concerning them, which he signified toTitus; and he could with joy declare the confidence he had in them forthe time to come. Here see the duties of a pastor and of his flock; thelatter must lighten the troubles of the pastoral office, by respect andobedience; the former make a due return by his care of them, andcherish the flock by testimonies of satisfaction, joy, and tenderness.
2Co 8:1-6	<br>The grace of God must be owned as the root and fountain of all the goodin us, or done by us, at any time. It is great grace and favour fromGod, if we are made useful to others, and forward to any good work. Hecommends the charity of the Macedonians. So far from needing that Paulshould urge them, they prayed him to receive the gift. Whatever we useor lay out for God, it is only giving him what is his own. All we givefor charitable uses, will not be accepted of God, nor turn to ouradvantage, unless we first give ourselves to the Lord. By ascribing allreally good works to the grace of God, we not only give the glory tohim whose due it is, but also show men where their strength is.Abundant spiritual joy enlarges men's hearts in the work and labour oflove. How different this from the conduct of those who will not join inany good work, unless urged into it!
2Co 8:7-9	<br>Faith is the root; and as without faith it is not possible to pleaseGod, Heb 11:6, so those who abound in faith, will abound in othergraces and good works also; and this will work and show itself by love.Great talkers are not always the best doers; but these Corinthians werediligent to do, as well as to know and talk well. To all these goodthings the apostle desires them to add this grace also, to abound incharity to the poor. The best arguments for Christian duties, are drawnfrom the grace and love of Christ. Though he was rich, as being God,equal in power and glory with the Father, yet he not only became manfor us, but became poor also. At length he emptied himself, as it were,to ransom their souls by his sacrifice on the cross. From what riches,blessed Lord, to what poverty didst thou descend for our sakes! and towhat riches hast thou advanced us through thy poverty! It is ourhappiness to be wholly at thy disposal.
2Co 8:10-15	<br>Good purposes are like buds and blossoms, pleasant to behold, and givehopes of good fruit; but they are lost, and signify nothing withoutgood deeds. Good beginnings are well; but we lose the benefit, unlessthere is perseverance. When men purpose that which is good, andendeavour, according to their ability, to perform also, God will notreject them for what it is not in their power to do. But this scripturewill not justify those who think good meanings are enough, or that goodpurposes, and the mere profession of a willing mind, are enough tosave. Providence gives to some more of the good things of this world,and to some less, that those who have abundance might supply others whoare in want. It is the will of God, that by our mutual supplying oneanother, there should be some sort of equality; not such a levelling aswould destroy property, for in such a case there could be no exerciseof charity. All should think themselves concerned to relieve those inwant. This is shown from the gathering and giving out the manna in thewilderness, Ex 16:18. Those who have most of this world, have no morethan food and raiment; and those who have but little of this world,seldom are quite without them.
2Co 8:16-24	<br>The apostle commends the brethren sent to collect their charity, thatit might be known who they were, and how safely they might be trusted.It is the duty of all Christians to act prudently; to hinder, as far aswe can, all unjust suspicions. It is needful, in the first place, toact uprightly in the sight of God, but things honest in the sight ofmen should also be attended to. A clear character, as well as a pureconscience, is requisite for usefulness. They brought glory to Christas instruments, and had obtained honour from Christ to be countedfaithful, and employed in his service. The good opinion others have ofus, should be an argument with us to do well.
2Co 9:1-5	<br>When we would have others do good, we must act toward them prudentlyand tenderly, and give them time. Christians should consider what isfor the credit of their profession, and endeavour to adorn the doctrineof God their Saviour in all things. The duty of ministering to thesaints is so plain, that there would seem no need to exhort Christiansto it; yet self-love contends so powerfully against the love of Christ,that it is often necessary to stir up their minds by way ofremembrance.
2Co 9:6-15	<br>Money bestowed in charity, may to the carnal mind seem thrown away, butwhen given from proper principles, it is seed sown, from which avaluable increase may be expected. It should be given carefully. Worksof charity, like other good works, should be done with thought anddesign. Due thought, as to our circumstances, and those we are about torelieve, will direct our gifts for charitable uses. Help should begiven freely, be it more or less; not grudgingly, but cheerfully. Whilesome scatter, and yet increase; others withhold more than is meet, andit tends to poverty. If we had more faith and love, we should wasteless on ourselves, and sow more in hope of a plentiful increase. Can aman lose by doing that with which God is pleased? He is able to makeall grace abound towards us, and to abound in us; to give a largeincrease of spiritual and of temporal good things. He can make us tohave enough in all things; and to be content with what we have. Godgives not only enough for ourselves, but that also wherewith we maysupply the wants of others, and this should be as seed to be sown. Wemust show the reality of our subjection to the gospel, by works ofcharity. This will be for the credit of our profession, and to thepraise and glory of God. Let us endeavour to copy the example ofChrist, being unwearied in doing good, and deeming it more blessed togive than to receive. Blessed be God for the unspeakable gift of hisgrace, whereby he enables and inclines some of his people to bestowupon others, and others to be grateful for it; and blessed be hisglorious name to all eternity, for Jesus Christ, that inestimable giftof his love, through whom this and every other good thing, pertainingto life and godliness, are freely given unto us, beyond all expression,measure, or bounds.
2Co 10:1-6	<br>While others thought meanly, and spake scornfully of the apostle, hehad low thoughts, and spake humbly of himself. We should be aware ofour own infirmities, and think humbly of ourselves, even when menreproach us. The work of the ministry is a spiritual warfare withspiritual enemies, and for spiritual purposes. Outward force is not themethod of the gospel, but strong persuasions, by the power of truth andthe meekness of wisdom. Conscience is accountable to God only; andpeople must be persuaded to God and their duty, not driven by force.Thus the weapons of our warfare are very powerful; the evidence oftruth is convincing. What opposition is made against the gospel, by thepowers of sin and Satan in the hearts of men! But observe the conquestthe word of God gains. The appointed means, however feeble they appearto some, will be mighty through God. And the preaching of the cross, bymen of faith and prayer, has always been fatal to idolatry, impiety,and wickedness.
2Co 10:7-11	<br>In outward appearance, Paul was mean and despised in the eyes of some,but this was a false rule to judge by. We must not think that noneoutward appearance, as if the want of such things proved a man not tobe a real Christian, or an able, faithful minister of the lowlySaviour.
2Co 10:12-18	<br>If we would compare ourselves with others who excel us, this would be agood method to keep us humble. The apostle fixes a good rule for hisconduct; namely, not to boast of things without his measure, which wasthe measure God had distributed to him. There is not a more fruitfulsource of error, than to judge of persons and opinions by our ownprejudices. How common is it for persons to judge of their ownreligious character, by the opinions and maxims of the world aroundthem! But how different is the rule of God's word! And of all flattery,self-flattery is the worst. Therefore, instead of praising ourselves,we should strive to approve ourselves to God. In a word, let us gloryin the Lord our salvation, and in all other things only as evidences ofhis love, or means of promoting his glory. Instead of praisingourselves, or seeking the praise of men, let us desire that honourwhich cometh from God only.
2Co 11:1-4	<br>The apostle desired to preserve the Corinthians from being corrupted bythe false apostles. There is but one Jesus, one Spirit, and one gospel,to be preached to them, and received by them; and why should any beprejudiced, by the devices of an adversary, against him who firsttaught them in faith? They should not listen to men, who, withoutcause, would draw them away from those who were the means of theirconversion.
2Co 11:5-15	<br>It is far better to be plain in speech, yet walking openly andconsistently with the gospel, than to be admired by thousands, and belifted up in pride, so as to disgrace the gospel by evil tempers andunholy lives. The apostle would not give room for any to accuse him ofworldly designs in preaching the gospel, that others who opposed him atCorinth, might not in this respect gain advantage against him.Hypocrisy may be looked for, especially when we consider the greatpower which Satan, who rules in the hearts of the children ofdisobedience, has upon the minds of many. And as there are temptationsto evil conduct, so there is equal danger on the other side. It servesSatan's purposes as well, to set up good works against the atonement ofChrist, and salvation by faith and grace. But the end will discoverthose who are deceitful workers; their work will end in ruin. Satanwill allow his ministers to preach either the law or the gospelseparately; but the law as established by faith in Christ'srighteousness and atonement, and the partaking of his Spirit, is thetest of every false system.
2Co 11:16-21	<br>It is the duty and practice of Christians to humble themselves, inobedience to the command and example of the Lord; yet prudence mustdirect in what it is needful to do things which we may do lawfully,even the speaking of what God has wrought for us, and in us, and by us.Doubtless here is reference to facts in which the character of thefalse apostles had been shown. It is astonishing to see how such menbring their followers into bondage, and how they take from them andinsult them.
2Co 11:22-33	<br>The apostle gives an account of his labours and sufferings; not out ofpride or vain-glory, but to the honour of God, who enabled him to doand suffer so much for the cause of Christ; and shows wherein heexcelled the false apostles, who tried to lessen his character andusefulness. It astonishes us to reflect on this account of his dangers,hardships, and sufferings, and to observe his patience, perseverance,diligence, cheerfulness, and usefulness, in the midst of all thesetrials. See what little reason we have to love the pomp and plenty ofthis world, when this blessed apostle felt so much hardship in it. Ourutmost diligence and services appear unworthy of notice when comparedwith his, and our difficulties and trials scarcely can be perceived. Itmay well lead us to inquire whether or not we really are followers ofChrist. Here we may study patience, courage, and firm trust in God.Here we may learn to think less of ourselves; and we should everstrictly keep to truth, as in God's presence; and should refer all tohis glory, as the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who is blessed forevermore.
2Co 12:1-6	<br>There can be no doubt the apostle speaks of himself. Whether heavenlythings were brought down to him, while his body was in a trance, as inthe case of ancient prophets; or whether his soul was dislodged fromthe body for a time, and taken up into heaven, or whether he was takenup, body and soul together, he knew not. We are not capable, nor is itfit we should yet know, the particulars of that glorious place andstate. He did not attempt to publish to the world what he had heardthere, but he set forth the doctrine of Christ. On that foundation thechurch is built, and on that we must build our faith and hope. Andwhile this teaches us to enlarge our expectations of the glory thatshall be revealed, it should render us contented with the usual methodsof learning the truth and will of God.
2Co 12:7-10	<br>The apostle gives an account of the method God took to keep him humble,and to prevent his being lifted up above measure, on account of thevisions and revelations he had. We are not told what this thorn in theflesh was, whether some great trouble, or some great temptation. ButGod often brings this good out of evil, that the reproaches of ourenemies help to hide pride from us. If God loves us, he will keep usfrom being exalted above measure; and spiritual burdens are ordered tocure spiritual pride. This thorn in the flesh is said to be a messengerof Satan which he sent for evil; but God designed it, and overruled itfor good. Prayer is a salve for every sore, a remedy for every malady;and when we are afflicted with thorns in the flesh, we should giveourselves to prayer. If an answer be not given to the first prayer, norto the second, we are to continue praying. Troubles are sent to teachus to pray; and are continued, to teach us to continue instant inprayer. Though God accepts the prayer of faith, yet he does not alwaysgive what is asked for: as he sometimes grants in wrath, so hesometimes denies in love. When God does not take away our troubles andtemptations, yet, if he gives grace enough for us, we have no reason tocomplain. Grace signifies the good-will of God towards us, and that isenough to enlighten and enliven us, sufficient to strengthen andcomfort in all afflictions and distresses. His strength is made perfectin our weakness. Thus his grace is manifested and magnified. When weare weak in ourselves, then we are strong in the grace of our LordJesus Christ; when we feel that we are weak in ourselves, then we go toChrist, receive strength from him, and enjoy most the supplies ofDivine strength and grace.
2Co 12:11-21	<br>We owe it to good men, to stand up in the defence of their reputation;and we are under special obligations to those from whom we havereceived benefit, especially spiritual benefit, to own them asinstruments in God's hand of good to us. Here is an account of theapostle's behaviour and kind intentions; in which see the character ofa faithful minister of the gospel. This was his great aim and design,to do good. Here are noticed several sins commonly found amongprofessors of religion. Falls and misdeeds are humbling to a minister;and God sometimes takes this way to humble those who might be temptedto be lifted up. These vast verses show to what excesses the falseteachers had drawn aside their deluded followers. How grievous it isthat such evils should be found among professors of the gospel! Yetthus it is, and has been too often, and it was so even in the days ofthe apostles.
2Co 13:1-6	<br>Though it is God's gracious method to bear long with sinners, yet hewill not bear always; at length he will come, and will not spare thosewho remain obstinate and impenitent. Christ at his crucifixion,appeared as only a weak and helpless man, but his resurrection and lifeshowed his Divine power. So the apostles, how mean and contemptiblesoever they appeared to the world, yet, as instruments, they manifestedthe power of God. Let them prove their tempers, conduct, andexperience, as gold is assayed or proved by the touchstone. If theycould prove themselves not to be reprobates, not to be rejected ofChrist, he trusted they would know that he was not a reprobate, notdisowned by Christ. They ought to know if Christ Jesus was in them, bythe influences, graces, and indwelling of his Spirit, by his kingdomset up in their hearts. Let us question our own souls; either we aretrue Christians, or we are deceivers. Unless Christ be in us by hisSpirit, and power of his love, our faith is dead, and we are yetdisapproved by our Judge.
2Co 13:7-10	<br>The most desirable thing we can ask of God, for ourselves and ourfriends, is to be kept from sin, that we and they may not do evil. Wehave far more need to pray that we may not do evil, than that we maynot suffer evil. The apostle not only desired that they might be keptfrom sin, but also that they might grow in grace, and increase inholiness. We are earnestly to pray to God for those we caution, thatthey may cease to do evil, and learn to do well; and we should be gladfor others to be strong in the grace of Christ, though it may be themeans of showing our own weakness. let us also pray that we may beenabled to make a proper use of all our talents.
2Co 13:11-14	<br>Here are several good exhortations. God is the Author of peace andLover of concord; he hath loved us, and is willing to be at peace withus. And let it be our constant aim so to walk, that separation from ourfriends may be only for a time, and that we may meet in that happyworld where parting will be unknown. He wishes that they may partakeall the benefits which Christ of his free grace and favour haspurchased; the Father out of his free love has purposed; and the HolyGhost applies and bestows.
Gal 1:1-5	<br>St. Paul was an apostle of Jesus Christ; he was expressly appointed byhim, consequently by God the Father, who is one with him in respect ofhis Divine nature, and who appointed Christ as Mediator. Grace,includes God's good-will towards us, and his good work upon us; andpeace, all that inward comfort, or outward prosperity, which is reallyneedful for us. They come from God the Father, as the Fountain, throughJesus Christ. But observe, first grace, and then peace; there can be notrue peace without grace. Christ gave himself for our sins, to makeatonement for us: this the justice of God required, and to this hefreely submitted. Here is to be observed the infinite greatness of theprice bestowed, and then it will appear plainly, that the power of sinis so great, that it could by no means be put away except the Son ofGod be given for it. He that considers these things well, understandsthat sin is a thing the most horrible that can be expressed; whichought to move us, and make us afraid indeed. Especially mark well thewords, "for our sins." For here our weak nature starts back, and wouldfirst be made worthy by her own works. It would bring him that iswhole, and not him that has need of a physician. Not only to redeem usfrom the wrath of God, and the curse of the law; but also to recover usfrom wicked practices and customs, to which we are naturally enslaved.But it is in vain for those who are not delivered from this presentevil world by the sanctification of the Spirit, to expect that they arefreed from its condemnation by the blood of Jesus.
Gal 1:6-9	<br>Those who would establish any other way to heaven than what the gospelof Christ reveals, will find themselves wretchedly mistaken. Theapostle presses upon the Galatians a due sense of their guilt inforsaking the gospel way of justification; yet he reproves withtenderness, and represents them as drawn into it by the arts of somethat troubled them. In reproving others, we should be faithful, and yetendeavour to restore them in the spirit of meekness. Some would set upthe works of the law in the place of Christ's righteousness, and thusthey corrupted Christianity. The apostle solemnly denounces, asaccursed, every one who attempts to lay so false a foundation. Allother gospels than that of the grace of Christ, whether more flatteringto self-righteous pride, or more favourable to worldly lusts, aredevices of Satan. And while we declare that to reject the moral law asa rule of life, tends to dishonour Christ, and destroy true religion,we must also declare, that all dependence for justification on goodworks, whether real or supposed, is as fatal to those who persist init. While we are zealous for good works, let us be careful not to putthem in the place of Christ's righteousness, and not to advance anything which may betray others into so dreadful a delusion.
Gal 1:10-14	<br>In preaching the gospel, the apostle sought to bring persons to theobedience, not of men, but of God. But Paul would not attempt to alterthe doctrine of Christ, either to gain their favour, or to avoid theirfury. In so important a matter we must not fear the frowns of men, norseek their favour, by using words of men's wisdom. Concerning themanner wherein he received the gospel, he had it by revelation fromHeaven. He was not led to Christianity, as many are, merely byeducation.
Gal 1:15-24	<br>St. Paul was wonderfully brought to the knowledge and faith of Christ.All who are savingly converted, are called by the grace of God; theirconversion is wrought by his power and grace working in them. It willbut little avail us to have Christ revealed to us, if he is not alsorevealed in us. He instantly prepared to obey, without hesitating as tohis worldly interest, credit, ease, or life itself. And what matter ofthanksgiving and joy is it to the churches of Christ, when they hear ofsuch instances to the praise of the glory of his grace, whether theyhave ever seen them or not! They glorify God for his power and mercy insaving such persons, and for all the service to his people and causethat is done, and may be further expected from them.
Gal 2:1-10	<br>Observe the apostle's faithfulness in giving a full account of thedoctrine he had preached among the Gentiles, and was still resolved topreach, that of Christianity, free from all mixture of Judaism. Thisdoctrine would be ungrateful to many, yet he was not afraid to own it.His care was, lest the success of his past labours should be lessened,or his future usefulness be hindered. While we simply depend upon Godfor success to our labours, we should use every proper caution toremove mistakes, and against opposers. There are things which maylawfully be complied with, yet, when they cannot be done withoutbetraying the truth, they ought to be refused. We must not give placeto any conduct, whereby the truth of the gospel would be reflectedupon. Though Paul conversed with the other apostles, yet he did notreceive any addition to his knowledge, or authority, from them.Perceiving the grace given to him, they gave unto him and Barnabas theright hand of fellowship, whereby they acknowledged that he wasdesigned to the honour and office of an apostle as well as themselves.They agreed that these two should go to the heathen, while theycontinued to preach to the Jews; judging it agreeable to the mind ofChrist, so to divide their work. Here we learn that the gospel is notours, but God's; and that men are but the keepers of it; for this weare to praise God. The apostle showed his charitable disposition, andhow ready he was to own the Jewish converts as brethren, though manywould scarcely allow the like favour to the converted Gentiles; butmere difference of opinion was no reason to him why he should not helpthem. Herein is a pattern of Christian charity, which we should extendto all the disciples of Christ.
Gal 2:11-14	<br>Notwithstanding Peter's character, yet, when Paul saw him acting so asto hurt the truth of the gospel and the peace of the church, he was notafraid to reprove him. When he saw that Peter and the others did notlive up to that principle which the gospel taught, and which theyprofessed, namely, That by the death of Christ the partition wallbetween Jew and Gentile was taken down, and the observance of the lawof Moses was no longer in force; as Peter's offence was public, hepublicly reproved him. There is a very great difference between theprudence of St. Paul, who bore with, and used for a time, theceremonies of the law as not sinful, and the timid conduct of St.Peter, who, by withdrawing from the Gentiles, led others to think thatthese ceremonies were necessary.
Gal 2:15-19	<br>Paul, having thus shown he was not inferior to any apostle, not toPeter himself, speaks of the great foundation doctrine of the gospel.For what did we believe in Christ? Was it not that we might bejustified by the faith of Christ? If so, is it not foolish to go backto the law, and to expect to be justified by the merit of moral works,or sacrifices, or ceremonies? The occasion of this declarationdoubtless arose from the ceremonial law; but the argument is quite asstrong against all dependence upon the works of the moral law, asrespects justification. To give the greater weight to this, it isadded, But if, while we seek to be justified by Christ, we ourselvesalso are found sinners, is Christ the minister of sin? This would bevery dishonourable to Christ, and also very hurtful to them. Byconsidering the law itself, he saw that justification was not to beexpected by the works of it, and that there was now no further need ofthe sacrifices and cleansings of it, since they were done away inChrist, by his offering up himself a sacrifice for us. He did not hopeor fear any thing from it; any more than a dead man from enemies. Butthe effect was not a careless, lawless life. It was necessary, that hemight live to God, and be devoted to him through the motives and graceof the gospel. It is no new prejudice, though a most unjust one, thatthe doctrine of justification by faith alone, tends to encourage peoplein sin. Not so, for to take occasion from free grace, or the doctrineof it, to live in sin, is to try to make Christ the minister of sin, atany thought of which all Christian hearts would shudder.
Gal 2:20,21	<br>Here, in his own person, the apostle describes the spiritual or hiddenlife of a believer. The old man is crucified, Ro 6:6, but the new manis living; sin is mortified, and grace is quickened. He has thecomforts and the triumphs of grace; yet that grace is not from himself,but from another. Believers see themselves living in a state ofdependence on Christ. Hence it is, that though he lives in the flesh,yet he does not live after the flesh. Those who have true faith, liveby that faith; and faith fastens upon Christ's giving himself for us.He loved me, and gave himself for me. As if the apostle said, The Lordsaw me fleeing from him more and more. Such wickedness, error, andignorance were in my will and understanding, that it was not possiblefor me to be ransomed by any other means than by such a price. Considerwell this price. Here notice the false faith of many. And theirprofession is accordingly; they have the form of godliness without thepower of it. They think they believe the articles of faith aright, butthey are deceived. For to believe in Christ crucified, is not only tobelieve that he was crucified, but also to believe that I am crucifiedwith him. And this is to know Christ crucified. Hence we learn what isthe nature of grace. God's grace cannot stand with man's merit. Graceis no grace unless it is freely given every way. The more simply thebeliever relies on Christ for every thing, the more devotedly does hewalk before Him in all his ordinances and commandments. Christ livesand reigns in him, and he lives here on earth by faith in the Son ofGod, which works by love, causes obedience, and changes into his holyimage. Thus he neither abuses the grace of God, nor makes it in vain.
Gal 3:1-5	<br>Several things made the folly of the Galatian Christians worse. Theyhad the doctrine of the cross preached, and the Lord's supperadministered among them, in both which Christ crucified, and the natureof his sufferings, had been fully and clearly set forth. Had they beenmade partakers of the Holy Spirit, by the ministration of the law, oron account of any works done by them in obedience thereto? Was it notby their hearing and embracing the doctrine of faith in Christ alonefor justification? Which of these had God owned with tokens of hisfavour and acceptance? It was not by the first, but the last. And thosemust be very unwise, who suffer themselves to be turned away from theministry and doctrine which have been blessed to their spiritualadvantage. Alas, that men should turn from the all-important doctrineof Christ crucified, to listen to useless distinctions, mere moralpreaching, or wild fancies! The god of this world, by various men andmeans, has blinded men's eyes, lest they should learn to trust in acrucified Saviour. We may boldly demand where the fruits of the HolySpirit are most evidently brought forth? whether among those who preachjustification by the works of the law, or those who preach the doctrineof faith? Assuredly among the latter.
Gal 3:6-14	<br>The apostle proves the doctrine he had blamed the Galatians forrejecting; namely, that of justification by faith without the works ofthe law. This he does from the example of Abraham, whose faith fastenedupon the word and promise of God, and upon his believing he was ownedand accepted of God as a righteous man. The Scripture is said toforesee, because the Holy Spirit that indited the Scripture didforesee. Through faith in the promise of God he was blessed; and it isonly in the same way that others obtain this privilege. Let us thenstudy the object, nature, and effects of Abraham's faith; for who canin any other way escape the curse of the holy law? The curse is againstall sinners, therefore against all men; for all have sinned, and arebecome guilty before God: and if, as transgressors of the law, we areunder its curse, it must be vain to look for justification by it. Thoseonly are just or righteous who are freed from death and wrath, andrestored into a state of life in the favour of God; and it is onlythrough faith that persons become righteous. Thus we see thatjustification by faith is no new doctrine, but was taught in the churchof God, long before the times of the gospel. It is, in truth, the onlyway wherein any sinners ever were, or can be justified. Thoughdeliverance is not to be expected from the law, there is a way open toescape the curse, and regain the favour of God, namely, through faithin Christ. Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law; being madesin, or a sin-offering, for us, he was made a curse for us; notseparated from God, but laid for a time under the Divine punishment.The heavy sufferings of the Son of God, more loudly warn sinners toflee from the wrath to come, than all the curses of the law; for howcan God spare any man who remains under sin, seeing that he spared nothis own Son, when our sins were charged upon him? Yet at the same time,Christ, as from the cross, freely invites sinners to take refuge inhim.
Gal 3:15-18	<br>The covenant God made with Abraham, was not done away by the giving thelaw to Moses. The covenant was made with Abraham and his Seed. It isstill in force; Christ abideth for ever in his person, and hisspiritual seed, who are his by faith. By this we learn the differencebetween the promises of the law and those of the gospel. The promisesof the law are made to the person of every man; the promises of thegospel are first made to Christ, then by him to those who are by faithingrafted into Christ. Rightly to divide the word of truth, a greatdifference must be put between the promise and the law, as to theinward affections, and the whole practice of life. When the promise ismingled with the law, it is made nothing but the law. Let Christ bealways before our eyes, as a sure argument for the defence of faith,against dependence on human righteousness.
Gal 3:19-22	<br>If that promise was enough for salvation, wherefore then serveth thelaw? The Israelites, though chosen to be God's peculiar people, weresinners as well as others. The law was not intended to discover a wayof justification, different from that made known by the promise, but tolead men to see their need of the promise, by showing the sinfulness ofsin, and to point to Christ, through whom alone they could be pardonedand justified. The promise was given by God himself; the law was givenby the ministry of angels, and the hand of a mediator, even Moses.Hence the law could not be designed to set aside the promise. Amediator, as the very term signifies, is a friend that comes betweentwo parties, and is not to act merely with and for one of them. Thegreat design of the law was, that the promise by faith of Jesus Christ,might be given to those that believe; that, being convinced of theirguilt, and the insufficiency of the law to effect a righteousness forthem, they might be persuaded to believe on Christ, and so obtain thebenefit of the promise. And it is not possible that the holy, just, andgood law of God, the standard of duty to all, should be contrary to thegospel of Christ. It tends every way to promote it.
Gal 3:23-25	<br>The law did not teach a living, saving knowledge; but, by its rites andceremonies, especially by its sacrifices, it pointed to Christ, thatthey might be justified by faith. And thus it was, as the word properlysignifies, a servant, to lead to Christ, as children are led to schoolby servants who have the care of them, that they might be more fullytaught by Him the true way of justification and salvation, which isonly by faith in Christ. And the vastly greater advantage of the gospelstate is shown, under which we enjoy a clearer discovery of Divinegrace and mercy than the Jews of old. Most men continue shut up as in adark dungeon, in love with their sins, being blinded and lulled asleepby Satan, through wordly pleasures, interests, and pursuits. But theawakened sinner discovers his dreadful condition. Then he feels thatthe mercy and grace of God form his only hope. And the terrors of thelaw are often used by the convincing Spirit, to show the sinner hisneed of Christ, to bring him to rely on his sufferings and merits, thathe may be justified by faith. Then the law, by the teaching of the HolySpirit, becomes his loved rule of duty, and his standard for dailyself-examination. In this use of it he learns to depend more simply onthe Saviour.
Gal 3:26-29	<br>Real Christians enjoy great privileges under the gospel; and are nolonger accounted servants, but sons; not now kept at such a distance,and under such restraints as the Jews were. Having accepted ChristJesus as their Lord and Saviour, and relying on him alone forjustification and salvation, they become the sons of God. But nooutward forms or profession can secure these blessings; for if any manhave not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his. In baptism we put onChrist; therein we profess to be his disciples. Being baptized intoChrist, we are baptized into his death, that as he died and rose again,so we should die unto sin, and walk in newness and holiness of life.The putting on of Christ according to the gospel, consists not inoutward imitation, but in a new birth, an entire change. He who makesbelievers to be heirs, will provide for them. Therefore our care mustbe to do the duties that belong to us, and all other cares we must castupon God. And our special care must be for heaven; the things of thislife are but trifles. The city of God in heaven, is the portion orchild's part. Seek to be sure of that above all things.
Gal 4:1-7	<br>The apostle deals plainly with those who urged the law of Mosestogether with the gospel of Christ, and endeavoured to bring believersunder its bondage. They could not fully understand the meaning of thelaw as given by Moses. And as that was a dispensation of darkness, soof bondage; they were tied to many burdensome rites and observances, bywhich they were taught and kept subject like a child under tutors andgovernors. We learn the happier state of Christians under the gospeldispensation. From these verses see the wonders of Divine love andmercy; particularly of God the Father, in sending his Son into theworld to redeem and save us; of the Son of God, in submitting so low,and suffering so much for us; and of the Holy Spirit, in condescendingto dwell in the hearts of believers, for such gracious purposes. Also,the advantages Christians enjoy under the gospel. Although by naturechildren of wrath and disobedience, they become by grace children oflove, and partake of the nature of the children of God; for he willhave all his children resemble him. Among men the eldest son is heir;but all God's children shall have the inheritance of eldest sons. Maythe temper and conduct of sons ever show our adoption; and may the HolySpirit witness with our spirits that we are children and heirs of God.
Gal 4:8-11	<br>The happy change whereby the Galatians were turned from idols to theliving God, and through Christ had received the adoption of sons, wasthe effect of his free and rich grace; they were laid under the greaterobligation to keep to the liberty wherewith he had made them free. Allour knowledge of God begins on his part; we know him because we areknown of him. Though our religion forbids idolatry, yet many practisespiritual idolatry in their hearts. For what a man loves most, andcares most for, that is his god: some have their riches for their god,some their pleasures, and some their lusts. And many ignorantly worshipa god of their own making; a god made all of mercy and no justice. Forthey persuade themselves that there is mercy for them with God, thoughthey repent not, but go on in their sins. It is possible for those whohave made great professions of religion, to be afterwards drawn asidefrom purity and simplicity. And the more mercy God has shown, inbringing any to know the gospel, and the liberties and privileges ofit, the greater their sin and folly in suffering themselves to bedeprived of them. Hence all who are members of the outward churchshould learn to fear and to suspect themselves. We must not be contentbecause we have some good things in ourselves. Paul fears lest hislabour is in vain, yet he still labours; and thus to do, whateverfollows, is true wisdom and the fear of God. This every man mustremember in his place and calling.
Gal 4:12-18	<br>The apostle desires that they would be of one mind with him respectingthe law of Moses, as well as united with him in love. In reprovingothers, we should take care to convince them that our reproofs are fromsincere regard to the honour of God and religion and their welfare. Theapostle reminds the Galatians of the difficulty under which he labouredwhen he first came among them. But he notices, that he was a welcomemessenger to them. Yet how very uncertain are the favour and respect ofmen! Let us labour to be accepted of God. You once thought yourselveshappy in receiving the gospel; have you now reason to think otherwise?Christians must not forbear speaking the truth, for fear of offendingothers. The false teachers who drew the Galatians from the truth of thegospel were designing men. They pretended affection, but they were notsincere and upright. An excellent rule is given. It is good to bezealous always in a good thing; not for a time only, or now and then,but always. Happy would it be for the church of Christ, if this zealwas better maintained.
Gal 4:19,20	<br>The Galatians were ready to account the apostle their enemy, but heassures them he was their friend; he had the feelings of a parenttoward them. He was in doubt as to their state, and was anxious to knowthe result of their present delusions. Nothing is so sure a proof thata sinner has passed into a state of justification, as Christ beingformed in him by the renewal of the Holy Spirit; but this cannot behoped for, while men depend on the law for acceptance with God.
Gal 4:21-27	<br>The difference between believers who rested in Christ only, and thosewho trusted in the law, is explained by the histories of Isaac andIshmael. These things are an allegory, wherein, beside the literal andhistorical sense of the words, the Spirit of God points out somethingfurther. Hagar and Sarah were apt emblems of the two differentdispensations of the covenant. The heavenly Jerusalem, the true churchfrom above, represented by Sarah, is in a state of freedom, and is themother of all believers, who are born of the Holy Spirit. They were byregeneration and true faith, made a part of the true seed of Abraham,according to the promise made to him.
Gal 4:28-31	<br>The history thus explained is applied. So then, brethren, we are notchildren of the bond-woman, but of the free. If the privileges of allbelievers were so great, according to the new covenant, how absurd forthe Gentile converts to be under that law, which could not deliver theunbelieving Jews from bondage or condemnation! We should not have foundout this allegory in the history of Sarah and Hagar, if it had not beenshown to us, yet we cannot doubt it was intended by the Holy Spirit. Itis an explanation of the subject, not an argument in proof of it. Thetwo covenants of works and grace, and legal and evangelical professors,are shadowed forth. Works and fruits brought forth in a man's ownstrength, are legal. But if arising from faith in Christ, they areevangelical. The first covenant spirit is of bondage unto sin anddeath. The second covenant spirit is of liberty and freedom; notliberty to sin, but in and unto duty. The first is a spirit ofpersecution; the second is a spirit of love. Let those professors lookto it, who have a violent, harsh, imposing spirit, towards the peopleof God. Yet as Abraham turned aside to Hagar, so it is possible abeliever may turn aside in some things to the covenant of works, whenthrough unbelief and neglect of the promise he acts according to thelaw, in his own strength; or in a way of violence, not of love, towardsthe brethren. Yet it is not his way, not his spirit to do so; hence heis never at rest, till he returns to his dependence on Christ again.Let us rest our souls on the Scriptures, and by a gospel hope andcheerful obedience, show that our conversation and treasure are indeedin heaven.
Gal 5:1-6	<br>Christ will not be the Saviour of any who will not own and rely uponhim as their only Saviour. Let us take heed to the warnings andpersuasions of the apostle to stedfastness in the doctrine and libertyof the gospel. All true Christians, being taught by the Holy Spirit,wait for eternal life, the reward of righteousness, and the object oftheir hope, as the gift of God by faith in Christ; and not for the sakeof their own works. The Jewish convert might observe the ceremonies orassert his liberty, the Gentile might disregard them or might attend tothem, provided he did not depend upon them. No outward privileges orprofession will avail to acceptance with God, without sincere faith inour Lord Jesus. True faith is a working grace; it works by love to God,and to our brethren. May we be of the number of those who, through theSpirit, wait for the hope of righteousness by faith. The danger of oldwas not in things of no consequence in themselves, as many forms andobservances now are. But without faith working by love, all else isworthless, and compared with it other things are of small value.
Gal 5:7-12	<br>The life of a Christian is a race, wherein he must run, and hold on, ifhe would obtain the prize. It is not enough that we professChristianity, but we must run well, by living up to that profession.Many who set out fairly in religion, are hindered in their progress, orturn out of the way. It concerns those who begin to turn out of theway, or to tire in it, seriously to inquire what hinders them. Theopinion or persuasion, 
Gal 5:8), was, no doubt, that of mixing theworks of the law with faith in Christ in justification. The apostleleaves them to judge whence it must arise, but sufficiently shows thatit could be owing to none but Satan. It is dangerous for Christianchurches to encourage those who follow, but especially who spread,destructive errors. And in reproving sin and error, we should alwaysdistinguish between the leaders and the led. The Jews were offended,because Christ was preached as the only salvation for sinners. If Pauland others would have admitted that the observance of the law of Moseswas to be joined with faith in Christ, as necessary to salvation, thenbelievers might have avoided many of the sufferings they underwent. Thefirst beginnings of such leaven should be opposed. And assuredly thosewho persist in disturbing the church of Christ must bear theirjudgment.	
Gal 5:13-15	<br>The gospel is a doctrine according to godliness, 1Ti 6:3, and is so farfrom giving the least countenance to sin, that it lays us under thestrongest obligation to avoid and subdue it. The apostle urges that allthe law is fulfilled in one word, even in this, Thou shalt love thyneighbour as thyself. If Christians, who should help one another, andrejoice one another, quarrel, what can be expected but that the God oflove should deny his grace, that the Spirit of love should depart, andthe evil spirit, who seeks their destruction, should prevail? Happywould it be, if Christians, instead of biting and devouring one anotheron account of different opinions, would set themselves against sin inthemselves, and in the places where they live.
Gal 5:16-26	<br>If it be our care to act under the guidance and power of the blessedSpirit, though we may not be freed from the stirrings and oppositionsof the corrupt nature which remains in us, it shall not have dominionover us. Believers are engaged in a conflict, in which they earnestlydesire that grace may obtain full and speedy victory. And those whodesire thus to give themselves up to be led by the Holy Spirit, are notunder the law as a covenant of works, nor exposed to its awful curse.Their hatred of sin, and desires after holiness, show that they have apart in the salvation of the gospel. The works of the flesh are manyand manifest. And these sins will shut men out of heaven. Yet whatnumbers, calling themselves Christians, live in these, and say theyhope for heaven! The fruits of the Spirit, or of the renewed nature,which we are to do, are named. And as the apostle had chiefly namedworks of the flesh, not only hurtful to men themselves, but tending tomake them so to one another, so here he chiefly notices the fruits ofthe Spirit, which tend to make Christians agreeable one to another, aswell as to make them happy. The fruits of the Spirit plainly show, thatsuch are led by the Spirit. By describing the works of the flesh andfruits of the Spirit, we are told what to avoid and oppose, and what weare to cherish and cultivate; and this is the sincere care andendeavour of all real Christians. Sin does not now reign in theirmortal bodies, so that they obey it, Ro 6:12, for they seek to destroyit. Christ never will own those who yield themselves up to be theservants of sin. And it is not enough that we cease to do evil, but wemust learn to do well. Our conversation will always be answerable tothe principle which guides and governs us, Ro 8:5. We must setourselves in earnest to mortify the deeds of the body, and to walk innewness of life. Not being desirous of vain-glory, or unduly wishingfor the esteem and applause of men, not provoking or envying oneanother, but seeking to bring forth more abundantly those good fruits,which are, through Jesus Christ, to the praise and glory of God.
Gal 6:1-5	<br>We are to bear one another's burdens. So we shall fulfil the law ofChrist. This obliges to mutual forbearance and compassion towards eachother, agreeably to his example. It becomes us to bear one another'sburdens, as fellow-travellers. It is very common for a man to look uponhimself as wiser and better than other men, and as fit to dictate tothem. Such a one deceives himself; by pretending to what he has not, heputs a cheat upon himself, and sooner or later will find the sadeffects. This will never gain esteem, either with God or men. Every oneis advised to prove his own work. The better we know our own hearts andways, the less shall we despise others, and the more be disposed tohelp them under infirmities and afflictions. How light soever men'ssins seem to them when committed, yet they will be found a heavyburden, when they come to reckon with God about them. No man can pay aransom for his brother; and sin is a burden to the soul. It is aspiritual burden; and the less a man feels it to be such, the morecause has he to suspect himself. Most men are dead in their sins, andtherefore have no sight or sense of the spiritual burden of sin.Feeling the weight and burden of our sins, we must seek to be easedthereof by the Saviour, and be warned against every sin.
Gal 6:6-11	<br>Many excuse themselves from the work of religion, though they may makea show, and profess it. They may impose upon others, yet they deceivethemselves if they think to impose upon God, who knows their hearts aswell as actions; and as he cannot be deceived, so he will not bemocked. Our present time is seed time; in the other world we shall reapas we sow now. As there are two sorts of sowing, one to the flesh, andthe other to the Spirit, so will the reckoning be hereafter. Those wholive a carnal, sensual life, must expect no other fruit from such acourse than misery and ruin. But those who, under the guidance andinfluences of the Holy Spirit, live a life of faith in Christ, andabound in Christian graces, shall of the Spirit reap life everlasting.We are all very apt to tire in duty, particularly in doing good. Thiswe should carefully watch and guard against. Only to perseverance inwell-doing is the reward promised. Here is an exhortation to all to dogood in their places. We should take care to do good in our life-time,and make this the business of our lives. Especially when freshoccasions offer, and as far as our power reaches.
Gal 6:12-15	<br>Proud, vain, and carnal hearts, are content with just so much religionas will help to keep up a fair show. But the apostle professes his ownfaith, hope, and joy; and that his principal glory was in the cross ofChrist. By which is here meant, his sufferings and death on the cross,the doctrine of salvation by a crucified Redeemer. By Christ, or by thecross of Christ, the world is crucified to the believer, and he to theworld. The more we consider the sufferings of the Redeemer from theworld, the less likely shall we be to love the world. The apostle wasas little affected by its charms, as a beholder would be by any thingwhich had been graceful in the face of a crucified person, when hebeholds it blackened in the agonies of death. He was no more affectedby the objects around him, than one who is expiring would be struckwith any of the prospects his dying eyes might view from the cross onwhich he hung. And as to those who have truly believed in Christ Jesus,all things are counted as utterly worthless compared with him. There isa new creation; old things are passed away, and new views anddispositions are brought in under the regenerating influences of Godthe Holy Spirit. Believers are brought into a new world, and beingcreated in Christ Jesus unto good works, are formed to a life ofholiness. It is a change of mind and heart, whereby we are enabled tobelieve in the Lord Jesus, and to live to God; and where this inward,practical religion is wanting, outward professions, or names, willnever stand in any stead.
Gal 6:16-18	<br>A new creation to the image of Christ, as showing faith in him, is thegreatest distinction between one man and another, and a blessing isdeclared on all who walk according to this rule. The blessings are,peace and mercy. Peace with God and our conscience, and all thecomforts of this life, as far as they are needful. And mercy, aninterest in the free love and favour of God in Christ, the spring andfountain of all other blessings. The written word of God is the rule weare to go by, both in its doctrines and precepts. May his grace ever bewith our spirit, to sanctify, quicken, and cheer us, and may we alwaysbe ready to maintain the honour of that which is indeed our life. Theapostle had in his body the marks of the Lord Jesus, the scars ofwounds from persecuting enemies, for his cleaving to Christ, and thedoctrine of the gospel. The apostle calls the Galatians his brethren,therein he shows his humility and his tender affection for them; and hetakes his leave with a very serious prayer, that they might enjoy thefavour of Christ Jesus, both in its effects and in its evidences. Weneed desire no more to make us happy than the grace of our Lord JesusChrist. The apostle does not pray that the law of Moses, or therighteousness of works, but that the grace of Christ, might be withthem; that it might be in their hearts and with their spirits,quickening, comforting, and strengthening them: to all which he setshis Amen; signifying his desire that so it might be, and his faith thatso it would be.
Eph 1:1,2	<br>All Christians must be saints; if they come not under that character onearth, they will never be saints in glory. Those are not saints, whoare not faithful, believing in Christ, and true to the profession theymake of relation to their Lord. By grace, understand the free andundeserved love and favour of God, and those graces of the Spirit whichcome from it; by peace, all other blessings, spiritual and temporal,the fruits of the former. No peace without grace. No peace, nor grace,but from God the Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ; and the bestsaints need fresh supplies of the graces of the Spirit, and desire togrow.
Eph 1:3-8	<br>Spiritual and heavenly blessings are the best blessings; with which wecannot be miserable, and without which we cannot but be so. This wasfrom the choice of them in Christ, before the foundation of the world,that they should be made holy by separation from sin, being set apartto God, and sanctified by the Holy Spirit, in consequence of theirelection in Christ. All who are chosen to happiness as the end, arechosen to holiness as the means. In love they were predestinated, orfore-ordained, to be adopted as children of God by faith in ChristJesus, and to be openly admitted to the privileges of that highrelation to himself. The reconciled and adopted believer, the pardonedsinner, gives all the praise of his salvation to his gracious Father.His love appointed this method of redemption, spared not his own Son,and brought believers to hear and embrace this salvation. It was richgrace to provide such a surety as his own Son, and freely to deliverhim up. This method of grace gives no encouragement to evil, but showssin in all its hatefulness, and how it deserves vengeance. Thebeliever's actions, as well as his words, declare the praises of Divinemercy.
Eph 1:9-14	<br>Blessings were made known to believers, by the Lord's showing to themthe mystery of his sovereign will, and the method of redemption andsalvation. But these must have been for ever hidden from us, if God hadnot made them known by his written word, preached gospel, and Spirit oftruth. Christ united the two differing parties, God and man, in his ownperson, and satisfied for that wrong which caused the separation. Hewrought, by his Spirit, those graces of faith and love, whereby we aremade one with God, and among ourselves. He dispenses all his blessings,according to his good pleasure. His Divine teaching led whom he pleasedto see the glory of those truths, which others were left to blaspheme.What a gracious promise that is, which secures the gift of the HolyGhost to those who ask him! The sanctifying and comforting influencesof the Holy Spirit seal believers as the children of God, and heirs ofheaven. These are the first-fruits of holy happiness. For this we weremade, and for this we were redeemed; this is the great design of God inall that he has done for us; let all be ascribed unto the praise of hisglory.
Eph 1:15-23	<br>God has laid up spiritual blessings for us in his Son the Lord Jesus;but requires us to draw them out and fetch them in by prayer. Even thebest Christians need to be prayed for: and while we hear of the welfareof Christian friends, we should pray for them. Even true believersgreatly want heavenly wisdom. Are not the best of us unwilling to comeunder God's yoke, though there is no other way to find rest for thesoul? Do we not for a little pleasure often part with our peace? And ifwe dispute less, and prayed more with and for each other, we shoulddaily see more and more what is the hope of our calling, and the richesof the Divine glory in this inheritance. It is desirable to feel themighty power of Divine grace, beginning and carrying on the work offaith in our souls. But it is difficult to bring a soul to believefully in Christ, and to venture its all, and the hope of eternal life,upon his righteousness. Nothing less than Almighty power will work thisin us. Here is signified that it is Christ the Saviour, who suppliesall the necessities of those who trust in him, and gives them allblessings in the richest abundance. And by being partakers of Christhimself, we come to be filled with the fulness of grace and glory inhim. How then do those forget themselves who seek for righteousness outof him! This teaches us to come to Christ. And did we know what we arecalled to, and what we might find in him, surely we should come and besuitors to him. When feeling our weakness and the power of our enemies,we most perceive the greatness of that mighty power which effects theconversion of the believer, and is engaged to perfect his salvation.Surely this will constrain us by love to live to our Redeemer's glory.
Eph 2:1-10	<br>Sin is the death of the soul. A man dead in trespasses and sins has nodesire for spiritual pleasures. When we look upon a corpse, it gives anawful feeling. A never-dying spirit is now fled, and has left nothingbut the ruins of a man. But if we viewed things aright, we should befar more affected by the thought of a dead soul, a lost, fallen spirit.A state of sin is a state of conformity to this world. Wicked men areslaves to Satan. Satan is the author of that proud, carnal dispositionwhich there is in ungodly men; he rules in the hearts of men. FromScripture it is clear, that whether men have been most prone to sensualor to spiritual wickedness, all men, being naturally children ofdisobedience, are also by nature children of wrath. What reason havesinners, then, to seek earnestly for that grace which will make them,of children of wrath, children of God and heirs of glory! God's eternallove or good-will toward his creatures, is the fountain whence all hismercies flow to us; and that love of God is great love, and that mercyis rich mercy. And every converted sinner is a saved sinner; deliveredfrom sin and wrath. The grace that saves is the free, undeservedgoodness and favour of God; and he saves, not by the works of the law,but through faith in Christ Jesus. Grace in the soul is a new life inthe soul. A regenerated sinner becomes a living soul; he lives a lifeof holiness, being born of God: he lives, being delivered from theguilt of sin, by pardoning and justifying grace. Sinners rollthemselves in the dust; sanctified souls sit in heavenly places, areraised above this world, by Christ's grace. The goodness of God inconverting and saving sinners heretofore, encourages others inafter-time, to hope in his grace and mercy. Our faith, our conversion,and our eternal salvation, are not of works, lest any man should boast.These things are not brought to pass by any thing done by us, thereforeall boasting is shut out. All is the free gift of God, and the effectof being quickened by his power. It was his purpose, to which heprepared us, by blessing us with the knowledge of his will, and hisHoly Spirit producing such a change in us, that we should glorify Godby our good conversation, and perseverance in holiness. None can fromScripture abuse this doctrine, or accuse it of any tendency to evil.All who do so, are without excuse.
Eph 2:11-13	<br>Christ and his covenant are the foundation of all the Christian'shopes. A sad and terrible description is here; but who is able toremove himself out of it? Would that this were not a true descriptionof many baptized in the name of Christ. Who can, without trembling,reflect upon the misery of a person, separated for ever from the peopleof God, cut off from the body of Christ, fallen from the covenant ofpromise, having no hope, no Saviour, and without any God but a God ofvengeance, to all eternity? To have no part in Christ! What trueChristian can hear this without horror? Salvation is far from thewicked; but God is a help at hand to his people; and this is by thesufferings and death of Christ.
Eph 2:14-18	<br>Jesus Christ made peace by the sacrifice of himself; in every senseChrist was their Peace, the author, centre, and substance of theirbeing at peace with God, and of their union with the Jewish believersin one church. Through the person, sacrifice, and mediation of Christ,sinners are allowed to draw near to God as a Father, and are broughtwith acceptance into his presence, with their worship and services,under the teaching of the Holy Spirit, as one with the Father and theSon. Christ purchased leave for us to come to God; and the Spirit givesa heart to come, and strength to come, and then grace to serve Godacceptably.
Eph 2:19-22	<br>The church is compared to a city, and every converted sinner is free ofit. It is also compared to a house, and every converted sinner is oneof the family; a servant, and a child in God's house. The church isalso compared to a building, founded on the doctrine of Christ;delivered by the prophets of the Old Testament, and the apostles of theNew. God dwells in all believers now; they become the temple of Godthrough the working of the blessed Spirit. Let us then ask if our hopesare fixed on Christ, according to the doctrine of his word? Have wedevoted ourselves as holy temples to God through him? Are wehabitations of God by the Spirit, are we spiritually-minded, and do webring forth the fruits of the Spirit? Let us take heed not to grievethe holy Comforter. Let us desire his gracious presence, and hisinfluences upon our hearts. Let us seek to discharge the dutiesallotted to us, to the glory of God.
Eph 3:1-7	<br>For having preached the doctrine of truth, the apostle was a prisoner,but a prisoner of Jesus Christ; the object of special protection andcare, while thus suffering for him. All the gracious offers of thegospel, and the joyful tidings it contains, come from the rich grace ofGod; it is the great means by which the Spirit works grace in the soulsof men. The mystery, is that secret, hidden purpose of salvationthrough Christ. This was not so fully and clearly shown in the agesbefore Christ, as unto the prophets of the New Testament. This was thegreat truth made known to the apostle, that God would call the Gentilesto salvation by faith in Christ. An effectual working of Divine powerattends the gifts of Divine grace. As God appointed Paul to the office,so he qualified him for it.
Eph 3:8-12	<br>Those whom God advances to honourable employments, he makes low intheir own eyes; and where God gives grace to be humble, there he givesall other needful grace. How highly he speaks of Jesus Christ; theunsearchable riches of Christ! Though many are not enriched with theseriches; yet how great a favour to have them preached among us, and tohave an offer of them! And if we are not enriched with them it is ourown fault. The first creation, when God made all things out of nothing,and the new creation, whereby sinners are made new creatures byconverting grace, are of God by Jesus Christ. His riches are asunsearchable and as sure as ever, yet while angels adore the wisdom ofGod in the redemption of his church, the ignorance of self-wise andcarnal men deems the whole to be foolishness.
Eph 3:13-19	<br>The apostle seems to be more anxious lest the believers should bediscouraged and faint upon his tribulations, than for what he himselfhad to bear. He asks for spiritual blessings, which are the bestblessings. Strength from the Spirit of God in the inner man; strengthin the soul; the strength of faith, to serve God, and to do our duty.If the law of Christ is written in our hearts, and the love of Christis shed abroad there, then Christ dwells there. Where his Spiritdwells, there he dwells. We should desire that good affections may befixed in us. And how desirable to have a fixed sense of the love of Godin Christ to our souls! How powerfully the apostle speaks of the loveof Christ! The breadth shows its extent to all nations and ranks; thelength, that it continues from everlasting to everlasting; the depth,its saving those who are sunk into the depths of sin and misery; theheight, its raising them up to heavenly happiness and glory. Those whoreceive grace for grace from Christ's fulness, may be said to be filledwith the fulness of God. Should not this satisfy man? Must he needsfill himself with a thousand trifles, fancying thereby to complete hishappiness?
Eph 3:20,21	<br>It is proper always to end prayers with praises. Let us expect more,and ask for more, encouraged by what Christ has already done for oursouls, being assured that the conversion of sinners, and the comfort ofbelievers, will be to his glory, for ever and ever.
Eph 4:1-6	<br>Nothing is pressed more earnestly in the Scriptures, than to walk asbecomes those called to Christ's kingdom and glory. By lowliness,understand humility, which is opposed to pride. By meekness, thatexcellent disposition of soul, which makes men unwilling to provoke,and not easily to be provoked or offended. We find much in ourselvesfor which we can hardly forgive ourselves; therefore we must not besurprised if we find in others that which we think it hard to forgive.There is one Christ in whom all believers hope, and one heaven they areall hoping for; therefore they should be of one heart. They had all onefaith, as to its object, Author, nature, and power. They all believedthe same as to the great truths of religion; they had all been admittedinto the church by one baptism, with water, in the name of the Father,and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, as the sign of regeneration. Inall believers God the Father dwells, as in his holy temple, by hisSpirit and special grace.
Eph 4:7-16	<br>Unto every believer is given some gift of grace, for their mutual help.All is given as seems best to Christ to bestow upon every one. Hereceived for them, that he might give to them, a large measure of giftsand graces; particularly the gift of the Holy Ghost. Not a mere headknowledge, or bare acknowledging Christ to be the Son of God, but suchas brings trust and obedience. There is a fulness in Christ, and ameasure of that fulness given in the counsel of God to every believer;but we never come to the perfect measure till we come to heaven. God'schildren are growing, as long as they are in this world; and theChristian's growth tends to the glory of Christ. The more a man findshimself drawn out to improve in his station, and according to hismeasure, all that he has received, to the spiritual good of others, hemay the more certainly believe that he has the grace of sincere loveand charity rooted in his heart. (Eph 4:17-24)
Eph 4:17-24	<br>The apostle charged the Ephesians in the name and by the authority ofthe Lord Jesus, that having professed the gospel, they should not be asthe unconverted Gentiles, who walked in vain fancies and carnalaffections. Do not men, on every side, walk in the vanity of theirminds? Must not we then urge the distinction between real and nominalChristians? They were void of all saving knowledge; they sat indarkness, and loved it rather than light. They had a dislike and hatredto a life of holiness, which is not only the way of life God requiresand approves, and by which we live to him, but which has some likenessto God himself in his purity, righteousness, truth, and goodness. Thetruth of Christ appears in its beauty and power, when it appears as inJesus. The corrupt nature is called a man; like the human body, it isof divers parts, supporting and strengthening one another. Sinfuldesires are deceitful lusts; they promise men happiness, but renderthem more miserable; and bring them to destruction, if not subdued andmortified. These therefore must be put off, as an old garment, a filthygarment; they must be subdued and mortified. But it is not enough toshake off corrupt principles; we must have gracious ones. By the newman, is meant the new nature, the new creature, directed by a newprinciple, even regenerating grace, enabling a man to lead a new lifeof righteousness and holiness. This is created, or brought forth byGod's almighty power.
Eph 4:25-28	<br>Notice the particulars wherewith we should adorn our Christianprofession. Take heed of every thing contrary to truth. No longerflatter or deceive others. God's people are children who will not lie,who dare not lie, who hate and abhor lying. Take heed of anger andungoverned passions. If there is just occasion to express displeasureat what is wrong, and to reprove, see that it be without sin. We giveplace to the devil, when the first motions of sin are not grievous toour souls; when we consent to them; and when we repeat an evil deed.This teaches that as sin, if yielded unto, lets in the devil upon us,we are to resist it, keeping from all appearance of evil. Idlenessmakes thieves. Those who will not work, expose themselves totemptations to steal. Men ought to be industrious, that they may dosome good, and that they may be kept from temptation. They must labour,not only that they may live honestly, but that they may have to give tothe wants of others. What then must we think of those calledChristians, who grow rich by fraud, oppression, and deceitfulpractices! Alms, to be accepted of God, must not be gained byunrighteousness and robbery, but by honesty and industry. God hatesrobbery for burnt-offerings.
Eph 4:29-32	<br>Filthy words proceed from corruption in the speaker, and they corruptthe minds and manners of those who hear them: Christians should bewareof all such discourse. It is the duty of Christians to seek, by theblessing of God, to bring persons to think seriously, and to encourageand warn believers by their conversation. Be ye kind one to another.This sets forth the principle of love in the heart, and the outwardexpression of it, in a humble, courteous behaviour. Mark how God'sforgiveness causes us to forgive. God forgives us, though we had nocause to sin against him. We must forgive, as he has forgiven us. Alllying, and corrupt communications, that stir up evil desires and lusts,grieve the Spirit of God. Corrupt passions of bitterness, wrath, anger,clamour, evil-speaking, and malice, grieve the Holy Spirit. Provoke notthe holy, blessed Spirit of God to withdraw his presence and hisgracious influences. The body will be redeemed from the power of thegrave at the resurrection day. Wherever that blessed Spirit dwells as aSanctifier, he is the earnest of all the joys and glories of thatredemption day; and we should be undone, should God take away his HolySpirit from us.
Eph 5:1,2	<br>Because God, for Christ's sake, has forgiven you, therefore be yefollowers of God, imitators of God. Resemble him especially in his loveand pardoning goodness, as becomes those beloved by their heavenlyFather. In Christ's sacrifice his love triumphs, and we are to considerit fully.
Eph 5:3-14	<br>Filthy lusts must be rooted out. These sins must be dreaded anddetested. Here are not only cautions against gross acts of sin, butagainst what some may make light of. But these things are so far frombeing profitable. that they pollute and poison the hearers. Ourcheerfulness should show itself as becomes Christians, in what may tendto God's glory. A covetous man makes a god of his money; places thathope, confidence, and delight, in worldly good, which should be in Godonly. Those who allow themselves, either in the lusts of the flesh orthe love of the world, belong not to the kingdom of grace, nor shallthey come to the kingdom of glory. When the vilest transgressors repentand believe the gospel, they become children of obedience, from whomGod's wrath is turned away. Dare we make light of that which bringsdown the wrath of God? Sinners, like men in the dark, are going theyknow not whither, and doing they know not what. But the grace of Godwrought a mighty change in the souls of many. Walk as children oflight, as having knowledge and holiness. These works of darkness areunfruitful, whatever profit they may boast; for they end in thedestruction of the impenitent sinner. There are many ways of abetting,or taking part in the sins of others; by commendation, counsel,consent, or concealment. And if we share with others in their sins, wemust expect to share in their plagues. If we do not reprove the sins ofothers, we have fellowship with them. A good man will be ashamed tospeak of what many wicked men are not ashamed to do. We must have notonly a sight and a knowledge that sin is sin, and in some measureshameful, but see it as a breach of God's holy law. After the exampleof prophets and apostles, we should call on those asleep and dead insin, to awake and arise, that Christ may give them light.
Eph 5:15-21	<br>Another remedy against sin, is care, or caution, it being impossibleelse to maintain purity of heart and life. Time is a talent given us byGod, and it is misspent and lost when not employed according to hisdesign. If we have lost our time heretofore, we must double ourdiligence for the future. Of that time which thousands on a dying bedwould gladly redeem at the price of the whole world, how little do menthink, and to what trifles they daily sacrifice it! People are very aptto complain of bad times; it were well if that stirred them more toredeem time. Be not unwise. Ignorance of our duty, and neglect of oursouls, show the greatest folly. Drunkenness is a sin that never goesalone, but carries men into other evils; it is a sin very provoking toGod. The drunkard holds out to his family and to the world the sadspectacle of a sinner hardened beyond what is common, and hastening toperdition. When afflicted or weary, let us not seek to raise ourspirits by strong drink, which is hateful and hurtful, and only ends inmaking sorrows more felt. But by fervent prayer let us seek to befilled with the Spirit, and to avoid whatever may grieve our graciousComforter. All God's people have reason to sing for joy. Though we arenot always singing, we should be always giving thanks; we should neverwant disposition for this duty, as we never want matter for it, throughthe whole course of our lives. Always, even in trials and afflictions,and for all things; being satisfied of their loving intent, and goodtendency. God keeps believers from sinning against him, and engagesthem to submit one to another in all he has commanded, to promote hisglory, and to fulfil their duties to each other.
Eph 5:22-33	<br>The duty of wives is, submission to their husbands in the Lord, whichincludes honouring and obeying them, from a principle of love to them.The duty of husbands is to love their wives. The love of Christ to thechurch is an example, which is sincere, pure, and constant,notwithstanding her failures. Christ gave himself for the church, thathe might sanctify it in this world, and glorify it in the next, that hemight bestow on all his members a principle of holiness, and deliverthem from the guilt, the pollution, and the dominion of sin, by thoseinfluences of the Holy Spirit, of which baptismal water was the outwardsign. The church and believers will not be without spot or wrinkle tillthey come to glory. But those only who are sanctified now, shall beglorified hereafter. The words of Adam, mentioned by the apostle, arespoken literally of marriage; but they have also a hidden sense inthem, relating to the union between Christ and his church. It was akind of type, as having resemblance. There will be failures and defectson both sides, in the present state of human nature, yet this does notalter the relation. All the duties of marriage are included in unityand love. And while we adore and rejoice in the condescending love ofChrist, let husbands and wives learn hence their duties to each other.Thus the worst evils would be prevented, and many painful effects wouldbe avoided.
Eph 6:1-4	<br>The great duty of children is, to obey their parents. That obedienceincludes inward reverence, as well as outward acts, and in every ageprosperity has attended those distinguished for obedience to parents.The duty of parents. Be not impatient; use no unreasonable severities.Deal prudently and wisely with children; convince their judgements andwork upon their reason. Bring them up well; under proper andcompassionate correction; and in the knowledge of the duty Godrequires. Often is this duty neglected, even among professors of thegospel. Many set their children against religion; but this does notexcuse the children's disobedience, though it may be awfully occasionit. God alone can change the heart, yet he gives his blessing to thegood lessons and examples of parents, and answers their prayers. Butthose, whose chief anxiety is that their children should be rich andaccomplished, whatever becomes of their souls, must not look for theblessing of God.
Eph 6:5-9	<br>The duty of servants is summed up in one word, obedience. The servantsof old were generally slaves. The apostles were to teach servants andmasters their duties, in doing which evils would be lessened, tillslavery should be rooted out by the influence of Christianity. Servantsare to reverence those over them. They are to be sincere; notpretending obedience when they mean to disobey, but serving faithfully.And they must serve their masters not only when their master's eye isupon them; but must be strict in the discharge of their duty, when heis absent and out of the way. Steady regard to the Lord Jesus Christwill make men faithful and sincere in every station, not grudgingly orby constraint, but from a principle of love to the masters and theirconcerns. This makes service easy to them, pleasing to their masters,and acceptable to the Lord Christ. God will reward even the meanestdrudgery done from a sense of duty, and with a view to glorify him.Here is the duty of masters. Act after the same manner. Be just toservants, as you expect they should be to you; show the like good-willand concern for them, and be careful herein to approve yourselves toGod. Be not tyrannical and overbearing. You have a Master to obey, andyou and they are but fellow-servants in respect to Christ Jesus. Ifmasters and servants would consider their duties to God, and theaccount they must shortly give to him, they would be more mindful oftheir duty to each other, and thus families would be more orderly andhappy.
Eph 6:10-18	<br>Spiritual strength and courage are needed for our spiritual warfare andsuffering. Those who would prove themselves to have true grace, mustaim at all grace; and put on the whole armour of God, which he preparesand bestows. The Christian armour is made to be worn; and there is noputting off our armour till we have done our warfare, and finished ourcourse. The combat is not against human enemies, nor against our owncorrupt nature only; we have to do with an enemy who has a thousandways of beguiling unstable souls. The devils assault us in the thingsthat belong to our souls, and labour to deface the heavenly image inour hearts. We must resolve by God's grace, not to yield to Satan.Resist him, and he will flee. If we give way, he will get ground. If wedistrust either our cause, or our Leader, or our armour, we give himadvantage. The different parts of the armour of heavy-armed soldiers,who had to sustain the fiercest assaults of the enemy, are heredescribed. There is none for the back; nothing to defend those who turnback in the Christian warfare. Truth, or sincerity, is the girdle. Thisgirds on all the other pieces of our armour, and is first mentioned.There can be no religion without sincerity. The righteousness ofChrist, imputed to us, is a breastplate against the arrows of Divinewrath. The righteousness of Christ implanted in us, fortifies the heartagainst the attacks of Satan. Resolution must be as greaves, or armourto our legs; and to stand their ground or to march forward in ruggedpaths, the feet must be shod with the preparation of the gospel ofpeace. Motives to obedience, amidst trials, must be drawn from a clearknowledge of the gospel. Faith is all in all in an hour of temptation.Faith, as relying on unseen objects, receiving Christ and the benefitsof redemption, and so deriving grace from him, is like a shield, adefence every way. The devil is the wicked one. Violent temptations, bywhich the soul is set on fire of hell, are darts Satan shoots at us.Also, hard thoughts of God, and as to ourselves. Faith applying theword of God and the grace of Christ, quenches the darts of temptation.Salvation must be our helmet. A good hope of salvation, a Scripturalexpectation of victory, will purify the soul, and keep it from beingdefiled by Satan. To the Christian armed for defense in battle, theapostle recommends only one weapon of attack; but it is enough, thesword of the Spirit, which is the word of God. It subdues and mortifiesevil desires and blasphemous thoughts as they rise within; and answersunbelief and error as they assault from without. A single text, wellunderstood, and rightly applied, at once destroys a temptation or anobjection, and subdues the most formidable adversary. Prayer mustfasten all the other parts of our Christian armour. There are otherduties of religion, and of our stations in the world, but we must keepup times of prayer. Though set and solemn prayer may not be seasonablewhen other duties are to be done, yet short pious prayers darted out,always are so. We must use holy thoughts in our ordinary course. A vainheart will be vain in prayer. We must pray with all kinds of prayer,public, private, and secret; social and solitary; solemn and sudden:with all the parts of prayer; confession of sin, petition for mercy,and thanksgiving for favours received. And we must do it by the graceof God the Holy Spirit, in dependence on, and according to, histeaching. We must preserve in particular requests, notwithstandingdiscouragements. We must pray, not for ourselves only, but for allsaints. Our enemies are mighty, and we are without strength, but ourRedeemer is almighty, and in the power of his mighty we may overcome.Wherefore we must stir up ourselves. Have not we, when God has called,often neglected to answer? Let us think upon these things, and continueour prayers with patience. (Eph 6:19-24)
Eph 6:19-24	<br>The gospel was a mystery till made known by Divine revelation; and itis the work of Christ's ministers to declare it. The best and mosteminent ministers need the prayers of believers. Those particularlyshould be prayed for, who are exposed to great hardships and perils intheir work. Peace be to the brethren, and love with faith. By peace,understand all manner of peace; peace with God, peace of conscience,peace among themselves. And the grace of the Spirit, producing faithand love, and every grace. These he desires for those in whom they werealready begun. And all grace and blessings come to the saints from God,through Jesus Christ our Lord. Grace, that is, the favour of God; andall good, spiritual and temporal, which is from it, is and shall bewith all those who thus love our Lord Jesus Christ in sincerity, andwith them only.
Phi 1:1-7	<br>The highest honour of the most eminent ministers is, to be servants ofChrist. And those who are not really saints on earth, never will besaints in heaven. Out of Christ, the best saints are sinners, andunable to stand before God. There is no peace without grace. Inwardpeace springs from a sense of Divine favour. And there is no grace andpeace but from God our Father, the fountain and origin of allblessings. At Philippi the apostle was evil entreated, and saw littlefruit of his labour; yet he remembers Philippi with joy. We must thankour God for the graces and comforts, gifts and usefulness of others, aswe receive the benefit, and God receives the glory. The work of gracewill never be perfected till the day of Jesus Christ, the day of hisappearance. But we may always be confident God will perform his goodwork, in every soul wherein he has really begun it by regeneration;though we must not trust in outward appearances, nor in any thing but anew creation to holiness. People are dear to their ministers, when theyreceive benefit by their ministry. Fellow-sufferers in the cause of Godshould be dear one to another.
Phi 1:8-11	<br>Shall not we pity and love those souls whom Christ loves and pities?Those who abound in any grace, need to abound more. Try things whichdiffer; that we may approve the things which are excellent. The truthsand laws of Christ are excellent; and they recommend themselves as suchto any attentive mind. Sincerity is that in which we should have ourconversation in the world, and it is the glory of all our graces.Christians should not be apt to take offence, and should be verycareful not to offend God or the brethren. The things which most honourGod will most benefit us. Let us not leave it doubtful whether any goodfruit is found in us or not. A small measure of Christian love,knowledge, and fruitfulness should not satisfy any.
Phi 1:12-20	<br>The apostle was a prisoner at Rome; and to take off the offence of thecross, he shows the wisdom and goodness of God in his sufferings. Thesethings made him known, where he would never have otherwise been known;and led some to inquire after the gospel. He suffered from falsefriends, as well as from enemies. How wretched the temper of those whopreached Christ out of envy and contention, and to add affliction tothe bonds that oppressed this best of men! The apostle was easy in themidst of all. Since our troubles may tend to the good of many, we oughtto rejoice. Whatever turns to our salvation, is by the Spirit ofChrist; and prayer is the appointed means of seeking for it. Ourearnest expectation and hope should not be to be honoured of men, or toescape the cross, but to be upheld amidst temptation, contempt, andaffliction. Let us leave it to Christ, which way he will make usserviceable to his glory, whether by labour or suffering, by diligenceor patience, by living to his honour in working for him, or dying tohis honour in suffering for him.
Phi 1:21-26	<br>Death is a great loss to a carnal, worldly man, for he loses all hisearthly comforts and all his hopes; but to a true believer it is gain,for it is the end of all his weakness and misery. It delivers him fromall the evils of life, and brings him to possess the chief good. Theapostle's difficulty was not between living in this world and living inheaven; between these two there is no comparison; but between servingChrist in this world and enjoying him in another. Not between two evilthings, but between two good things; living to Christ and being withhim. See the power of faith and of Divine grace; it can make us willingto die. In this world we are compassed with sin; but when with Christ,we shall escape sin and temptation, sorrow and death, for ever. Butthose who have most reason to desire to depart, should be willing toremain in the world as long as God has any work for them to do. And themore unexpected mercies are before they come, the more of God will beseen in them.
Phi 1:27-30	<br>Those who profess the gospel of Christ, should live as becomes thosewho believe gospel truths, submit to gospel laws, and depend upongospel promises. The original word "conversation" denotes the conductof citizens who seek the credit, safety, peace, and prosperity of theircity. There is that in the faith of the gospel, which is worth strivingfor; there is much opposition, and there is need of striving. A man maysleep and go to hell; but he who would go to heaven, must look abouthim and be diligent. There may be oneness of heart and affection amongChristians, where there is diversity of judgment about many things.Faith is God's gift on the behalf of Christ; the ability anddisposition to believe are from God. And if we suffer reproach and lossfor Christ, we are to reckon them a gift, and prize them accordingly.Yet salvation must not be ascribed to bodily afflictions, as thoughafflictions and worldly persecutions deserved it; but from God only issalvation: faith and patience are his gifts.
Phi 2:1-4	<br>Here are further exhortations to Christian duties; to like-mindednessand lowly-mindedness, according to the example of the Lord Jesus.Kindness is the law of Christ's kingdom, the lesson of his school, thelivery of his family. Several motives to brotherly love are mentioned.If you expect or experience the benefit of God's compassions toyourselves, be compassionate one to another. It is the joy of ministersto see people like-minded. Christ came to humble us, let there not beamong us a spirit of pride. We must be severe upon our own faults, andquick in observing our own defects, but ready to make favourableallowances for others. We must kindly care for others, but not bebusy-bodies in other men's matters. Neither inward nor outward peacecan be enjoyed, without lowliness of mind.
Phi 2:5-11	<br>The example of our Lord Jesus Christ is set before us. We must resemblehim in his life, if we would have the benefit of his death. Notice thetwo natures of Christ; his Divine nature, and human nature. Who beingin the form of God, partaking the Divine nature, as the eternal andonly-begotten Son of God, Joh 1:1, had not thought it a robbery to beequal with God, and to receive Divine worship from men. His humannature; herein he became like us in all things except sin. Thus low, ofhis own will, he stooped from the glory he had with the Father beforethe world was. Christ's two states, of humiliation and exaltation, arenoticed. Christ not only took upon him the likeness and fashion, orform of a man, but of one in a low state; not appearing in splendour.His whole life was a life of poverty and suffering. But the lowest stepwas his dying the death of the cross, the death of a malefactor and aslave; exposed to public hatred and scorn. The exaltation was ofChrist's human nature, in union with the Divine. At the name of Jesus,not the mere sound of the word, but the authority of Jesus, all shouldpay solemn homage. It is to the glory of God the Father, to confessthat Jesus Christ is Lord; for it is his will, that all men shouldhonour the Son as they honour the Father, Joh 5:23. Here we see suchmotives to self-denying love as nothing else can supply. Do we thuslove and obey the Son of God?
Phi 2:12-18	<br>We must be diligent in the use of all the means which lead to oursalvation, persevering therein to the end. With great care, lest, withall our advantages, we should come short. Work out your salvation, forit is God who worketh in you. This encourages us to do our utmost,because our labour shall not be in vain: we must still depend on thegrace of God. The working of God's grace in us, is to quicken andengage our endeavours. God's good-will to us, is the cause of his goodwork in us. Do your duty without murmurings. Do it, and do not findfault with it. Mind your work, and do not quarrel with it. Bypeaceableness; give no just occasion of offence. The children of Godshould differ from the sons of men. The more perverse others are, themore careful we should be to keep ourselves blameless and harmless. Thedoctrine and example of consistent believers will enlighten others, anddirect their way to Christ and holiness, even as the light-house warnsmariners to avoid rocks, and directs their course into the harbour. Letus try thus to shine. The gospel is the word of life, it makes known tous eternal life through Jesus Christ. Running, denotes earnestness andvigour, continual pressing forward; labouring, denotes constancy, andclose application. It is the will of God that believers should be muchin rejoicing; and those who are so happy as to have good ministers,have great reason to rejoice with them. (Php 2:19-30)
Phi 2:19-30	<br>It is best with us, when our duty becomes natural to us. Naturally,that is, sincerely, and not in pretence only; with a willing heart andupright views. We are apt to prefer our own credit, ease, and safety,before truth, holiness, and duty; but Timothy did not so. Paul desiredliberty, not that he might take pleasure, but that he might do good.Epaphroditus was willing to go to the Philippians, that he might becomforted with those who had sorrowed for him when he was sick. Itseems, his illness was caused by the work of God. The apostle urgesthem to love him the more on that account. It is doubly pleasant tohave our mercies restored by God, after great danger of their removal;and this should make them more valued. What is given in answer toprayer, should be received with great thankfulness and joy.
Phi 3:1-11	<br>Sincere Christians rejoice in Christ Jesus. The prophet calls the falseprophets dumb dogs, Isa 56:10; to which the apostle seems to refer.Dogs, for their malice against faithful professors of the gospel ofChrist, barking at them and biting them. They urged human works inopposition to the faith of Christ; but Paul calls them evil-workers. Hecalls them the concision; as they rent the church of Christ, and cut itto pieces. The work of religion is to no purpose, unless the heart isin it, and we must worship God in the strength and grace of the DivineSpirit. They rejoice in Christ Jesus, not in mere outward enjoymentsand performances. Nor can we too earnestly guard against those whooppose or abuse the doctrine of free salvation. If the apostle wouldhave gloried and trusted in the flesh, he had as much cause as any man.But the things which he counted gain while a Pharisee, and had reckonedup, those he counted loss for Christ. The apostle did not persuade themto do any thing but what he himself did; or to venture on any thing butthat on which he himself ventured his never-dying soul. He deemed allthese things to be but loss, compared with the knowledge of Christ, byfaith in his person and salvation. He speaks of all worldly enjoymentsand outward privileges which sought a place with Christ in his heart,or could pretend to any merit and desert, and counted them but loss;but it might be said, It is easy to say so; but what would he do whenhe came to the trial? He had suffered the loss of all for theprivileges of a Christian. Nay, he not only counted them loss, but thevilest refuse, offals thrown to dogs; not only less valuable thanChrist, but in the highest degree contemptible, when set up as againsthim. True knowledge of Christ alters and changes men, their judgmentsand manners, and makes them as if made again anew. The believer prefersChrist, knowing that it is better for us to be without all worldlyriches, than without Christ and his word. Let us see what the apostleresolved to cleave to, and that was Christ and heaven. We are undone,without righteousness wherein to appear before God, for we are guilty.There is a righteousness provided for us in Jesus Christ, and it is acomplete and perfect righteousness. None can have benefit by it, whotrust in themselves. Faith is the appointed means of applying thesaving benefit. It is by faith in Christ's blood. We are madeconformable to Christ's death, when we die to sin, as he died for sin;and the world is crucified to us, and we to the world, by the cross ofChrist. The apostle was willing to do or to suffer any thing, to attainthe glorious resurrection of saints. This hope and prospect carried himthrough all difficulties in his work. He did not hope to attain itthrough his own merit and righteousness, but through the merit andrighteousness of Jesus Christ. (Php 3:12-21)
Phi 3:12-21	<br>This simple dependence and earnestness of soul, were not mentioned asif the apostle had gained the prize, or were already made perfect inthe Saviour's likeness. He forgot the things which were behind, so asnot to be content with past labours or present measures of grace. Hereached forth, stretched himself forward towards his point; expressionsshowing great concern to become more and more like unto Christ. He whoruns a race, must never stop short of the end, but press forward asfast as he can; so those who have heaven in their view, must stillpress forward to it, in holy desires and hopes, and constantendeavours. Eternal life is the gift of God, but it is in Christ Jesus;through his hand it must come to us, as it is procured for us by him.There is no getting to heaven as our home, but by Christ as our Way.True believers, in seeking this assurance, as well as to glorify him,will seek more nearly to resemble his sufferings and death, by dying tosin, and by crucifying the flesh with its affections and lusts. Inthese things there is a great difference among real Christians, but allknow something of them. Believers make Christ all in all, and set theirhearts upon another world. If they differ from one another, and are notof the same judgment in lesser matters, yet they must not judge oneanother; while they all meet now in Christ, and hope to meet shortly inheaven. Let them join in all the great things in which they are agreed,and wait for further light as to lesser things wherein they differ. Theenemies of the cross of Christ mind nothing but their sensualappetites. Sin is the sinner's shame, especially when gloried in. Theway of those who mind earthly things, may seem pleasant, but death andhell are at the end of it. If we choose their way, we shall share theirend. The life of a Christian is in heaven, where his Head and his homeare, and where he hopes to be shortly; he sets his affections uponthings above; and where his heart is, there will his conversation be.There is glory kept for the bodies of the saints, in which they willappear at the resurrection. Then the body will be made glorious; notonly raised again to life, but raised to great advantage. Observe thepower by which this change will be wrought. May we be always preparedfor the coming of our Judge; looking to have our vile bodies changed byhis Almighty power, and applying to him daily to new-create our soulsunto holiness; to deliver us from our enemies, and to employ our bodiesand souls as instruments of righteousness in his service.
Phi 4:2-9	<br>Let believers be of one mind, and ready to help each other. As theapostle had found the benefit of their assistance, he knew howcomfortable it would be to his fellow-labourers to have the help ofothers. Let us seek to give assurance that our names are written in thebook of life. Joy in God is of great consequence in the Christian life;and Christians need to be again and again called to it. It more thanoutweighs all causes for sorrow. Let their enemies perceive howmoderate they were as to outward things, and how composedly theysuffered loss and hardships. The day of judgment will soon arrive, withfull redemption to believers, and destruction to ungodly men. There isa care of diligence which is our duty, and agrees with a wise forecastand due concern; but there is a care of fear and distrust, which is sinand folly, and only perplexes and distracts the mind. As a remedyagainst perplexing care, constant prayer is recommended. Not onlystated times for prayer, but in every thing by prayer. We must jointhanksgivings with prayers and supplications; not only seek supplies ofgood, but own the mercies we have received. God needs not to be toldour wants or desires; he knows them better than we do; but he will haveus show that we value the mercy, and feel our dependence on him. Thepeace of God, the comfortable sense of being reconciled to God, andhaving a part in his favour, and the hope of the heavenly blessedness,are a greater good than can be fully expressed. This peace will keepour hearts and minds through Christ Jesus; it will keep us from sinningunder troubles, and from sinking under them; keep us calm and withinward satisfaction. Believers are to get and to keep a good name; aname for good things with God and good men. We should walk in all theways of virtue, and abide therein; then, whether our praise is of menor not, it will be of God. The apostle is for an example. His doctrineand life agreed together. The way to have the God of peace with us, isto keep close to our duty. All our privileges and salvation arise inthe free mercy of God; yet the enjoyment of them depends on our sincereand holy conduct. These are works of God, pertaining to God, and to himonly are they to be ascribed, and to no other, neither men, words, nordeeds.
Phi 4:10-19	<br>It is a good work to succour and help a good minister in trouble. Thenature of true Christian sympathy, is not only to feel concern for ourfriends in their troubles, but to do what we can to help them. Theapostle was often in bonds, imprisonments, and necessities; but in all,he learned to be content, to bring his mind to his condition, and makethe best of it. Pride, unbelief, vain hankering after something we havenot got, and fickle disrelish of present things, make men discontentedeven under favourable circumstances. Let us pray for patient submissionand hope when we are abased; for humility and a heavenly mind whenexalted. It is a special grace to have an equal temper of mind always.And in a low state not to lose our comfort in God, nor distrust hisprovidence, nor take any wrong course for our own supply. In aprosperous condition not to be proud, or secure, or worldly. This is aharder lesson than the other; for the temptations of fulness andprosperity are more than those of affliction and want. The apostle hadno design to urge them to give more, but to encourage such kindness aswill meet a glorious reward hereafter. Through Christ we have grace todo what is good, and through him we must expect the reward; and as wehave all things by him, let us do all things for him, and to his glory.
Phi 4:20-23	<br>The apostle ends with praises to God. We should look upon God, underall our weakness and fears, not as an enemy, but as a Father, disposedto pity us and help us. We must give glory to God as a Father. God'sgrace and favour, which reconciled souls enjoy, with the whole of thegraces in us, which flow from it, are all purchased for us by Christ'smerit, and applied by his pleading for us; and therefore are justlycalled the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ.
Col 1:1-8	<br>All true Christians are brethren one to another. Faithfulness runsthrough every character and relation of the Christian life. Faith,hope, and love, are the three principal graces in the Christian life,and proper matter for prayer and thanksgiving. The more we fix ourhopes on the reward in the other world, the more free shall we be indoing good with our earthly treasure. It was treasured up for them, noenemy could deprive them of it. The gospel is the word of truth, and wemay safely venture our souls upon it. And all who hear the word of thegospel, ought to bring forth the fruit of the gospel, obey it, and havetheir principles and lives formed according to it. Worldly love arises,either from views of interest or from likeness in manners; carnal love,from the appetite for pleasure. To these, something corrupt, selfish,and base always cleaves. But Christian love arises from the HolySpirit, and is full of holiness. (Col 1:9-14)
Col 1:9-14	<br>The apostle was constant in prayer, that the believers might be filledwith the knowledge of God's will, in all wisdom. Good words will not dowithout good works. He who undertakes to give strength to his people,is a God of power, and of glorious power. The blessed Spirit is theauthor of this. In praying for spiritual strength, we are notstraitened, or confined in the promises, and should not be so in ourhopes and desires. The grace of God in the hearts of believers is thepower of God; and there is glory in this power. The special use of thisstrength was for sufferings. There is work to be done, even when we aresuffering. Amidst all their trials they gave thanks to the Father ofour Lord Jesus, whose special grace fitted them to partake of theinheritance provided for the saints. To bring about this change, thosewere made willing subjects of Christ, who were slaves of Satan. All whoare designed for heaven hereafter, are prepared for heaven now. Thosewho have the inheritance of sons, have the education of sons, and thedisposition of sons. By faith in Christ they enjoyed this redemption,as the purchase of his atoning blood, whereby forgiveness of sins, andall other spiritual blessings were bestowed. Surely then we shall deemit a favour to be delivered from Satan's kingdom and brought into thatof Christ, knowing that all trials will soon end, and that everybeliever will be found among those who come out of great tribulation.
Col 1:15-23	<br>Christ in his human nature, is the visible discovery of the invisibleGod, and he that hath seen Him hath seen the Father. Let us adore thesemysteries in humble faith, and behold the glory of the Lord in ChristJesus. He was born or begotten before all the creation, before anycreature was made; which is the Scripture way of representing eternity,and by which the eternity of God is represented to us. All things beingcreated by Him, were created for him; being made by his power, theywere made according to his pleasure, and for his praise and glory. Henot only created them all at first, but it is by the word of his powerthat they are upheld. Christ as Mediator is the Head of the body, thechurch; all grace and strength are from him; and the church is hisbody. All fulness dwells in him; a fulness of merit and righteousness,of strength and grace for us. God showed his justice in requiring fullsatisfaction. This mode of redeeming mankind by the death of Christ wasmost suitable. Here is presented to our view the method of beingreconciled. And that, notwithstanding the hatred of sin on God's part,it pleased God to reconcile fallen man to himself. If convinced that wewere enemies in our minds by wicked works, and that we are nowreconciled to God by the sacrifice and death of Christ in our nature,we shall not attempt to explain away, nor yet think fully to comprehendthese mysteries; but we shall see the glory of this plan of redemption,and rejoice in the hope set before us. If this be so, that God's loveis so great to us, what shall we do now for God? Be frequent in prayer,and abound in holy duties; and live no more to yourselves, but toChrist. Christ died for us. But wherefore? That we should still live insin? No; but that we should die to sin, and live henceforth not toourselves, but to Him.
Col 1:24-29	<br>Both the sufferings of the Head and of the members are called thesufferings of Christ, and make up, as it were, one body of sufferings.But He suffered for the redemption of the church; we suffer on otheraccounts; for we do but slightly taste that cup of afflictions of whichChrist first drank deeply. A Christian may be said to fill up thatwhich remains of the sufferings of Christ, when he takes up his cross,and after the pattern of Christ, bears patiently the afflictions Godallots to him. Let us be thankful that God has made known to usmysteries hidden from ages and generations, and has showed the richesof his glory among us. As Christ is preached among us, let us seriouslyinquire, whether he dwells and reigns in us; for this alone can warrantour assured hope of his glory. We must be faithful to death, throughall trials, that we may receive the crown of life, and obtain the endof our faith, the salvation of our souls.
Col 2:1-7	<br>The soul prospers when we have clear knowledge of the truth as it is inJesus. When we not only believe with the heart, but are ready, whencalled, to make confession with the mouth. Knowledge and faith make asoul rich. The stronger our faith, and the warmer our love, the morewill our comfort be. The treasures of wisdom are hid, not from us, butfor us, in Christ. These were hid from proud unbelievers, but displayedin the person and redemption of Christ. See the danger of enticingwords; how many are ruined by the false disguises and fair appearancesof evil principles and wicked practices! Be aware and afraid of thosewho would entice to any evil; for they aim to spoil you. All Christianshave, in profession at least, received Jesus Christ the Lord, consentedto him, and taken him for theirs. We cannot be built up in Christ, orgrow in him, unless we are first rooted in him, or founded upon him.Being established in the faith, we must abound therein, and improve init more and more. God justly withdraws this benefit from those who donot receive it with thanksgiving; and gratitude for his mercies isjustly required by God.
Col 2:8-17	<br>There is a philosophy which rightly exercises our reasonable faculties;a study of the works of God, which leads us to the knowledge of God,and confirms our faith in him. But there is a philosophy which is vainand deceitful; and while it pleases men's fancies, hinders their faith:such are curious speculations about things above us, or no concern tous. Those who walk in the way of the world, are turned from followingChrist. We have in Him the substance of all the shadows of theceremonial law. All the defects of it are made up in the gospel ofChrist, by his complete sacrifice for sin, and by the revelation of thewill of God. To be complete, is to be furnished with all thingsnecessary for salvation. By this one word "complete," is shown that wehave in Christ whatever is required. "In him," not when we look toChrist, as though he were distant from us, but we are in him, when, bythe power of the Spirit, we have faith wrought in our hearts by theSpirit, and we are united to our Head. The circumcision of the heart,the crucifixion of the flesh, the death and burial to sin and to theworld, and the resurrection to newness of life, set forth in baptism,and by faith wrought in our hearts, prove that our sins are forgiven,and that we are fully delivered from the curse of the law. ThroughChrist, we, who were dead in sins, are quickened. Christ's death wasthe death of our sins; Christ's resurrection is the quickening of oursouls. The law of ordinances, which was a yoke to the Jews, and apartition-wall to the Gentiles, the Lord Jesus took out of the way.When the substance was come, the shadows fled. Since every mortal manis, through the hand-writing of the law, guilty of death, how verydreadful is the condition of the ungodly and unholy, who trample underfoot that blood of the Son of God, whereby alone this deadlyhand-writing can be blotted out! Let not any be troubled about bigotedjudgments which related to meats, or the Jewish solemnities. Thesetting apart a portion of our time for the worship and service of God,is a moral and unchangeable duty, but had no necessary dependence uponthe seventh day of the week, the sabbath of the Jews. The first day ofthe week, or the Lord's day, is the time kept holy by Christians, inremembrance of Christ's resurrection. All the Jewish rites were shadowsof gospel blessings.
Col 2:18-23	<br>It looked like humility to apply to angels, as if men were conscious oftheir unworthiness to speak directly to God. But it is not warrantable;it is taking that honour which is due to Christ only, and giving it toa creature. There really was pride in this seeming humility. Those whoworship angels, disclaim Christ, who is the only Mediator between Godand man. It is an insult to Christ, who is the Head of the church, touse any intercessors but him. When men let go their hold of Christ,they catch at what will stand them in no stead. The body of Christ is agrowing body. And true believers cannot live in the fashions of theworld. True wisdom is, to keep close to the appointments of the gospel;in entire subjection to Christ, who is the only Head of his church.Self-imposed sufferings and fastings, might have a show of uncommonspirituality and willingness for suffering, but this was not "in anyhonour" to God. The whole tended, in a wrong manner, to satisfy thecarnal mind, by gratifying self-will, self-wisdom, self-righteousness,and contempt of others. The things being such as carry not with them somuch as the show of wisdom; or so faint a show that they do the soul nogood, and provide not for the satisfying of the flesh. What the Lordhas left indifferent, let us regard as such, and leave others to thelike freedom; and remembering the passing nature of earthly things, letus seek to glorify God in the use of them.
Col 3:1-4	<br>As Christians are freed from the ceremonial law, they must walk themore closely with God in gospel obedience. As heaven and earth arecontrary one to the other, both cannot be followed together; andaffection to the one will weaken and abate affection to the other.Those that are born again are dead to sin, because its dominion isbroken, its power gradually subdued by the operation of grace, and itshall at length be extinguished by the perfection of glory. To be dead,then, means this, that those who have the Holy Spirit, mortifyingwithin them the lusts of the flesh, are able to despise earthly things,and to desire those that are heavenly. Christ is, at present, one whomwe have not seen; but our comfort is, that our life is safe with him.The streams of this living water flow into the soul by the influencesof the Holy Spirit, through faith. Christ lives in the believer by hisSpirit, and the believer lives to him in all he does. At the secondcoming of Christ, there will be a general assembling of all theredeemed; and those whose life is now hid with Christ, shall thenappear with him in his glory. Do we look for such happiness, and shouldwe not set our affections upon that world, and live above this?
Col 3:5-11	<br>It is our duty to mortify our members which incline to the things ofthe world. Mortify them, kill them, suppress them, as weeds or verminwhich spread and destroy all about them. Continual opposition must bemade to all corrupt workings, and no provision made for carnalindulgences. Occasions of sin must be avoided: the lusts of the flesh,and the love of the world; and covetousness, which is idolatry; love ofpresent good, and of outward enjoyments. It is necessary to mortifysins, because if we do not kill them, they will kill us. The gospelchanges the higher as well as the lower powers of the soul, andsupports the rule of right reason and conscience, over appetite andpassion. There is now no difference from country, or conditions andcircumstances of life. It is the duty of every one to be holy, becauseChrist is a Christian's All, his only Lord and Saviour, and all hishope and happiness.
Col 3:12-17	<br>We must not only do no hurt to any, but do what good we can to all.Those who are the elect of God, holy and beloved, ought to be lowly andcompassionate towards all. While in this world, where there is so muchcorruption in our hearts, quarrels will sometimes arise. But it is ourduty to forgive one another, imitating the forgiveness through which weare saved. Let the peace of God rule in your hearts; it is of hisworking in all who are his. Thanksgiving to God, helps to make usagreeable to all men. The gospel is the word of Christ. Many have theword, but it dwells in them poorly; it has no power over them. The soulprospers, when we are full of the Scriptures and of the grace ofChrist. But when we sing psalms, we must be affected with what we sing.Whatever we are employed about, let us do every thing in the name ofthe Lord Jesus, and in believing dependence on him. Those who do all inChrist's name, will never want matter of thanksgiving to God, even theFather.
Col 3:18-25	<br>The epistles most taken up in displaying the glory of the Divine grace,and magnifying the Lord Jesus, are the most particular in pressing theduties of the Christian life. We must never separate the privileges andduties of the gospel. Submission is the duty of wives. But it issubmission, not to a severe lord or stern tyrant, but to her ownhusband, who is engaged to affectionate duty. And husbands must lovetheir wives with tender and faithful affection. Dutiful children arethe most likely to prosper. And parents must be tender, as well aschildren obedient. Servants are to do their duty, and obey theirmasters' commands, in all things consistent with duty to God theirheavenly Master. They must be both just and diligent; without selfishdesigns, or hypocrisy and disguise. Those who fear God, will be justand faithful when from under their master's eye, because they know theyare under the eye of God. And do all with diligence, not idly andslothfully; cheerfully, not discontented at the providence of God whichput them in that relation. And for servants' encouragement, let themknow, that in serving their masters according to the command of Christ,they serve Christ, and he will give them a glorious reward at last.But, on the other hand, he who doeth wrong, shall receive for the wrongwhich he hath done. God will punish the unjust, as well as reward thefaithful servant; and the same if masters wrong their servants. For therighteous Judge of the earth will deal justly between master andservant. Both will stand upon a level at his tribunal. How happy wouldtrue religion make the world, if it every where prevailed, influencedevery state of things, and every relation of life! But the professionof those persons who are regardless of duties, and give just cause forcomplaint to those they are connected with, deceives themselves, aswell as brings reproach on the gospel.
Col 4:2-6	<br>No duties can be done aright, unless we persevere in fervent prayer,and watch therein with thanksgiving. The people are to prayparticularly for their ministers. Believers are exhorted to rightconduct towards unbelievers. Be careful in all converse with them, todo them good, and recommend religion by all fit means. Diligence inredeeming time, commends religion to the good opinion of others. Evenwhat is only carelessness may cause a lasting prejudice against thetruth. Let all discourse be discreet and seasonable, as becomesChristians. Though it be not always of grace, it must always be withgrace. Though our discourse be of that which is common, yet it must bein a Christian manner. Grace is the salt which seasons our discourse,and keeps it from corrupting. It is not enough to answer what is asked,unless we answer aright also.
Col 4:7-9	<br>Ministers are servants to Christ, and fellow-servants to one another.They have one Lord, though they have different stations and powers forservice. It is a great comfort under the troubles and difficulties oflife, to have fellow Christians caring for us. Circumstances of lifemake no difference in the spiritual relation among sincere Christians;they partake of the same privileges, and are entitled to the sameregards. What amazing changes Divine grace makes! Faithless servantsbecome faithful and beloved brethren, and some who had done wrong,become fellow-workers of good.
Col 4:10-18	<br>Paul had differed with Barnabas, on the account of this Mark, yet he isnot only reconciled, but recommends him to the churches; an example ofa truly Christian and forgiving spirit. If men have been guilty of afault, it must not always be remembered against them. We must forget aswell as forgive. The apostle had comfort in the communion of saints andministers. One is his fellow-servant, another his fellow-prisoner, andall his fellow-workers, working out their own salvation, andendeavouring to promote the salvation of others. The effectual, ferventprayer is the prevailing prayer, and availeth much. The smiles,flatteries, or frowns of the world, the spirit of error, or the workingof self-love, leads many to a way of preaching and living which comesfar short of fulfilling their ministry. But those who preach the samedoctrine as Paul, and follow his example, may expect the Divine favourand blessing.
1Th 1:1-5	<br>As all good comes from God, so no good can be hoped for by sinners, butfrom God in Christ. And the best good may be expected from God, as ourFather, for the sake of Christ. We should pray, not only for ourselves,but for others also; remembering them without ceasing. Wherever thereis a true faith, it will work; it will affect both the heart and life.Faith works by love; it shows itself in love to God, and love to ourneighbour. And wherever there is a well-grounded hope of eternal life,this will appear by the exercise of patience; and it is a sign ofsincerity, when in all we do, we seek to approve ourselves to God. Bythis we may know our election, if we not only speak of the things ofGod with out lips, but feel their power in our hearts, mortifying ourlusts, weaning us from the world, and raising us up to heavenly things.Unless the Spirit of God comes with the word of God, it will be to us adead letter. Thus they entertained it by the power of the Holy Ghost.They were fully convinced of the truth of it, so as not to be shaken inmind by objections and doubts; and they were willing to leave all forChrist, and to venture their souls and everlasting condition upon thetruth of the gospel revelation.
1Th 1:6-10	<br>When careless, ignorant, and immoral persons are turned from theircarnal pursuits and connexions, to believe in and obey the Lord Jesus,to live soberly, righteously, and godly, the matter speaks for itself.The believers under the Old Testament waited for the coming of theMessiah, and believers now wait for his second coming. He is yet tocome. And God had raised him from the dead, which is a full assuranceunto all men that he will come to judgment. He came to purchasesalvation, and will, when he comes again, bring salvation with him,full and final deliverance from that wrath which is yet to come. Letall, without delay, flee from the wrath to come, and seek refuge inChrist and his salvation.
1Th 2:1-6	<br>The apostle had no wordly design in his preaching. Suffering in a goodcause should sharpen holy resolution. The gospel of Christ at first metwith much opposition; and it was preached with contention, withstriving in preaching, and against opposition. And as the matter of theapostle's exhortation was true and pure, the manner of his speaking waswithout guile. The gospel of Christ is designed for mortifying corruptaffections, and that men may be brought under the power of faith. Thisis the great motive to sincerity, to consider that God not only seesall we do, but knows our thoughts afar off, and searches the heart. Andit is from this God who trieth our hearts, that we must receive ourreward. The evidences of the apostle's sincerity were, that he avoidedflattery and covetousness. He avoided ambition and vain-glory.
1Th 2:7-12	<br>Mildness and tenderness greatly recommend religion, and are mostconformable to God's gracious dealing with sinners, in and by thegospel. This is the way to win people. We should not only be faithfulto our calling as Christians, but in our particular callings andrelations. Our great gospel privilege is, that God has called us to hiskingdom and glory. The great gospel duty is, that we walk worthy ofGod. We should live as becomes those called with such a high and holycalling. Our great business is to honour, serve, and please God, and toseek to be worthy of him.
1Th 2:13-16	<br>We should receive the word of God with affections suitable to itsholiness, wisdom, truth, and goodness. The words of men are frail andperishing, like themselves, and sometimes false, foolish, and fickle;but God's word is holy, wise, just, and faithful. Let us receive andregard it accordingly. The word wrought in them, to make them examplesto others in faith and good works, and in patience under sufferings,and in trials for the sake of the gospel. Murder and persecution arehateful to God, and no zeal for any thing in religion can excuse it.Nothing tends more to any person or people's filling up the measure oftheir sins, than opposing the gospel, and hindering the salvation ofsouls. The pure gospel of Christ is abhorred by many, and the faithfulpreaching of it is hindered in many ways. But those who forbid thepreaching it to sinners, to men dead in sin, do not by this please God.Those have cruel hearts, and are enemies to the glory of God, and tothe salvation of his people, who deny them the Bible.
1Th 2:17-20	<br>This world is not a place where we are to be always, or long together.In heaven holy souls shall meet, and never part more. And though theapostle could not come to them yet, and thought he might never be ableto come, yet our Lord Jesus Christ will come; nothing shall hinderthat. May God give faithful ministers to all who serve him with theirspirit in the gospel of his Son, and send them to all who are indarkness
1Th 3:1-5	<br>The more we find pleasure in the ways of God, the more we shall desireto persevere therein. The apostle's design was to establish and comfortthe Thessalonians as to the object of their faith, that Jesus Christwas the Saviour of the world; and as to the recompence of faith, whichwas more than enough to make up all their losses, and to reward alltheir labours. But he feared his labours would be in vain. If the devilcannot hinder ministers from labouring in the word and doctrine, hewill, if possible, hinder the success of their labours. No one wouldwillingly labour in vain. It is the will and purpose of God, that weenter into his kingdom through many afflictions. And the apostles, farfrom flattering people with the expectation of worldly prosperity inreligion, told them plainly they must count upon trouble in the flesh.Herein they followed the example of their great Master, the Author ofour faith. Christians were in danger, and they should be forewarned;they will thus be kept from being improved by any devices of thetempter.
1Th 3:6-10	<br>Thankfulness to God is very imperfect in the present state; but onegreat end of the ministry of the word is to help faith forward. Thatwhich was the instrument to obtain faith, is also the means ofincreasing and confirming it, namely, the ordinances of God; and asfaith cometh by hearing, so it is confirmed by hearing also.
1Th 3:11-13	<br>Prayer is religious worship, and all religious worship is due unto Godonly. Prayer is to be offered to God as our Father. Prayer is not onlyto be offered in the name of Christ, but offered up to Christ himself,as our Lord and our Saviour. Let us acknowledge God in all our ways,and he will direct our paths. Mutual love is required of allChristians. And love is of God, and is fulfilling the gospel as well asthe law. We need the Spirit's influences in order to our growth ingrace; and the way to obtain them, is prayer. Holiness is required ofall who would go to heaven; and we must act so that we do notcontradict the profession we make of holiness. The Lord Jesus willcertainly come in his glory; his saints will come with him. Then theexcellence as well as the necessity of holiness will appear; andwithout this no hearts shall be established at that day, nor shall anyavoid condemnation.
1Th 4:1-8	<br>To abide in the faith of the gospel is not enough, we must abound inthe work of faith. The rule according to which all ought to walk andact, is the commandments given by the Lord Jesus Christ.Sanctification, in the renewal of their souls under the influences ofthe Holy Spirit, and attention to appointed duties, constituted thewill of God respecting them. In aspiring after this renewal of the soulunto holiness, strict restraint must be put upon the appetites andsenses of the body, and on the thoughts and inclinations of the will,which lead to wrong uses of them. The Lord calls none into his familyto live unholy lives, but that they may be taught and enabled to walkbefore him in holiness. Some make light of the precepts of holiness,because they hear them from men; but they are God's commands, and tobreak them is to despise God.
1Th 4:9-12	<br>We should notice in others what is good, to their praise, that we mayengage them to abound therein more and more. All who are savinglytaught of God, are taught to love one another. The teaching of theSpirit exceeds the teachings of men; and men's teaching is vain anduseless, unless God teach. Those remarkable for this or any othergrace, need to increase therein, as well as to persevere to the end. Itis very desirable to have a calm and quiet temper, and to be of apeaceable and quiet behaviour. Satan is busy to trouble us; and we havein our hearts what disposes us to be unquiet; therefore let us study tobe quiet. Those who are busy-bodies, meddling in other men's matters,have little quiet in their own minds, and cause great disturbancesamong their neighbours. They seldom mind the other exhortation, to bediligent in their own calling, to work with their own hands.Christianity does not take us from the work and duty of our particularcallings, but teaches us to be diligent therein. People often byslothfulness reduce themselves to great straits, and are liable to manywants; while such as are diligent in their own business, earn their ownbread, and have great pleasure in so doing.
1Th 4:13-18	<br>Here is comfort for the relations and friends of those who die in theLord. Grief for the death of friends is lawful; we may weep for our ownloss, though it may be their gain. Christianity does not forbid, andgrace does not do away, our natural affections. Yet we must not beexcessive in our sorrows; this is too much like those who have no hopeof a better life. Death is an unknown thing, and we know little aboutthe state after death; yet the doctrines of the resurrection and thesecond coming of Christ, are a remedy against the fear of death, andundue sorrow for the death of our Christian friends; and of thesedoctrines we have full assurance. It will be some happiness that allthe saints shall meet, and remain together for ever; but the principalhappiness of heaven is to be with the Lord, to see him, live with him,and enjoy him for ever. We should support one another in times sorrow;not deaden one another's spirits, or weaken one another's hands. Andthis may be done by the many lessons to be learned from theresurrection of the dead, and the second coming of Christ. What!comfort a man by telling him he is going to appear before thejudgment-seat of God! Who can feel comfort from those words? That manalone with whose spirit the Spirit of God bears witness that his sinsare blotted out, and the thoughts of whose heart are purified by theHoly Spirit, so that he can love God, and worthily magnify his name. Weare not in a safe state unless it is thus with us, or we are desiringto be so.
1Th 5:1-5	<br>It is needless or useless to ask about the particular time of Christ'scoming. Christ did not reveal this to the apostles. There are times andseasons for us to work in, and these are our duty and interest to knowand observe; but as to the time when we must give up our account, weknow it not, nor is it needful that we should. The coming of Christwill be a great surprise to men. Our Lord himself said so. As the hourof death is the same to each person that the judgment will be tomankind in general, so the same remarks answer for both. Christ'scoming will be terrible to the ungodly. Their destruction will overtakethem while they dream of happiness, and please themselves with vainamusements. There will be no means to escape the terror or thepunishment of that day. This day will be a happy day to the righteous.They are not in darkness; they are the children of the light. It is thehappy condition of all true Christians. But how many are speaking peaceand safety to themselves, over whose heads utter destruction ishovering! Let us endeavour to awaken ourselves and each other, andguard against our spiritual enemies.
1Th 5:6-11	<br>Most of mankind do not consider the things of another world at all,because they are asleep; or they do not consider them aright, becausethey sleep and dream. Our moderation as to all earthly things should beknown to all men. Shall Christians, who have the light of the blessedgospel shining in their faces, be careless about their souls, andunmindful of another world? We need the spiritual armour, or the threeChristian graces, faith, love, and hope. Faith; if we believe that theeye of God is always upon us, that there is another world to preparefor, we shall see reason to watch and be sober. True and fervent loveto God, and the things of God, will keep us watchful and sober. If wehave hope of salvation, let us take heed of any thing that would shakeour trust in the Lord. We have ground on which to build unshaken hope,when we consider, that salvation is by our Lord Jesus Christ, who diedfor us, to atone for our sins and to ransom our souls. We should joinin prayer and praise one with another. We should set a good example onebefore another, and this is the best means to answer the end ofsociety. Thus we shall learn how to live to Him, with whom we hope tolive for ever.
1Th 5:12-15	<br>The ministers of the gospel are described by the work of their office,which is to serve and honour the Lord. It is their duty not only togive good counsel, but also to warn the flock of dangers, and reprovefor whatever may be amiss. The people should honour and love theirministers, because their business is the welfare of men's souls. Andthe people should be at peace among themselves, doing all they can toguard against any differences. But love of peace must not make us winkat sin. The fearful and sorrowful spirits, should be encouraged, and akind word may do much good. We must bear and forbear. We must belong-suffering, and keep down anger, and this to all men. Whatever mando to us, we must do good to others.
1Th 5:16-22	<br>We are to rejoice in creature-comforts, as if we rejoiced not, and mustnot expect to live many years, and rejoice in them all; but if we dorejoice in God, we may do that evermore. A truly religious life is alife of constant joy. And we should rejoice more, if we prayed more.Prayer will help forward all lawful business, and every good work. Ifwe pray without ceasing, we shall not want matter for thanksgiving inevery thing. We shall see cause to give thanks for sparing andpreventing, for common and uncommon, past and present, temporal andspiritual mercies. Not only for prosperous and pleasing, but also forafflicting providences, for chastisements and corrections; for Goddesigns all for our good, though we at present see not how they tend toit. Quench not the Spirit. Christians are said to be baptized with theHoly Ghost and with fire. He worketh as fire, by enlightening,enlivening, and purifying the souls of men. As fire is put out bytaking away fuel, and as it is quenched by pouring water, or putting agreat deal of earth upon it; so we must be careful not to quench theHoly Spirit, by indulging carnal lusts and affections, minding onlyearthly things. Believers often hinder their growth in grace, by notgiving themselves up to the spiritual affections raised in their heartsby the Holy Spirit. By prophesyings, here understand the preaching ofthe word, the interpreting and applying the Scriptures. We must notdespise preaching, though it is plain, and we are told no more thanwhat we knew before. We must search the Scriptures. And proving allthings must be to hold fast that which is good. We should abstain fromsin, and whatever looks like sin, leads to it, and borders upon it. Hewho is not shy of the appearances of sin, who shuns not the occasionsof it, and who avoids not the temptations and approaches to it, willnot long keep from doing sin.
1Th 5:23-28	<br>The apostle prays that they might be sanctified more perfectly, for thebest are sanctified but in part while in this world; therefore weshould pray for, and press toward, complete holiness. And as we mustfall, if God did not carry on his good work in the soul, we should prayto God to perfect his work, till we are presented faultless before thethrone of his glory. We should pray for one another; and brethrenshould thus express brotherly love. This epistle was to be read to allthe brethren. Not only are the common people allowed to read theScriptures, but it is their duty, and what they should be persuaded todo. The word of God should not be kept in an unknown tongue, buttransplanted, that as all men are concerned to know the Scriptures, sothey all may be able to read them. The Scriptures should be read in allpublic congregations, for the benefit of the unlearned especially. Weneed no more to make us happy, than to know the grace of our Lord JesusChrist. He is an ever-flowing and an over-flowing fountain of grace tosupply all our wants.
2Th 1:1-4	<br>Where there is the truth of grace, there will be an increase of it. Thepath of the just is as the shining light, which shines more and moreunto the perfect day. And where there is the increase of grace, Godmust have all the glory. Where faith grows, love will abound, for faithworks by love. It shows faith and patience, such as may be proposed asa pattern for others, when trials from God, and persecutions from men,quicken the exercise of those graces; for the patience and faith ofwhich the apostle gloried, bore them up, and enabled them to endure alltheir tribulations.
2Th 1:5-10	<br>Religion, if worth anything, is worth every thing; and those have noreligion, or none worth having, or know not how to value it, cannotfind their hearts to suffer for it. We cannot by all our sufferings,any more than by our services, merit heaven; but by our patience undersufferings, we are prepared for the promised joy. Nothing more stronglymarks a man for eternal ruin, than a spirit of persecution and enmityto the name and people of God. God will trouble those that trouble hispeople. And there is a rest for the people of God; a rest from sin andsorrow. The certainty of future recompence is proved by therighteousness of God. The thoughts of this should be terrible to wickedmen, and support the righteous. Faith, looking to the great day, isenabled partly to understand the book of providence, which appearsconfused to unbelievers. The Lord Jesus will in that day appear fromheaven. He will come in the glory and power of the upper world. Hislight will be piercing, and his power consuming, to all who in that dayshall be found as chaff. This appearance will be terrible to those thatknow not God, especially to those who rebel against revelation, andobey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ. This is the great crimeof multitudes, the gospel is revealed, and they will not believe it; orif they pretend to believe, they will not obey it. Believing the truthsof the gospel, is in order to our obeying the precepts of the gospel.Though sinners may be long spared, they will be punished at last. Theydid sin's work, and must receive sin's wages. Here God punishes sinnersby creatures as instruments; but then, it will be destruction from theAlmighty; and who knows the power of his anger? It will be a joyful dayto some, to the saints, to those who believe and obey the gospel. Inthat bright and blessed day, Christ Jesus will be glorified and admiredby his saints. And Christ will be glorified and admired in them. Hisgrace and power will be shown, when it shall appear what he haspurchased for, and wrought in, and bestowed upon those who believe inhim. Lord, if the glory put upon thy saints shall be thus admired, howmuch more shalt thou be admired, as the Bestower of that glory! Theglory of thy justice in the damnation of the wicked will be admired,but not as the glory of thy mercy in the salvation of believers. Howwill this strike the adoring angels with holy admiration, and transportthy admiring saints with eternal rapture! The meanest believer shallenjoy more than the most enlarged heart can imagine while we are here;Christ will be admired in all those that believe, the meanest believernot excepted.
2Th 1:11,12	<br>Believing thoughts and expectations of the second coming of Christshould lead us to pray to God more, for ourselves and others. If thereis any good in us, it is owing to the good pleasure of his goodness,and therefore it is called grace. There are many purposes of grace andgood-will in God toward his people, and the apostle prays that Godwould complete in them the work of faith with power. This is to theirdoing every other good work. The power of God not only begins, butcarries on the work of faith. And this is the great end and design ofthe grace of our God and Lord Jesus Christ, which is made known to us,and wrought in us.
2Th 2:1-4	<br>If errors arise among Christians, we should set them right; and goodmen will be careful to suppress errors which rise from mistaking theirwords and actions. We have a cunning adversary, who watches to domischief, and will promote errors, even by the words of Scripture.Whatever uncertainty we are in, or whatever mistakes may arise aboutthe time of Christ's coming, that coming itself is certain. This hasbeen the faith and hope of all Christians, in all ages of the church;it was the faith and hope of the Old Testament saints. All believersshall be gathered together to Christ, to be with him, and to be happyin his presence for ever. We should firmly believe the second coming ofChrist; but there was danger lest the Thessalonians, being mistaken asto the time, should question the truth or certainty of the thingitself. False doctrines are like the winds that toss the water to andfro; and they unsettle the minds of men, which are as unstable aswater. It is enough for us to know that our Lord will come, and willgather all his saints unto him. A reason why they should not expect thecoming of Christ, as at hand, is given. There would be a generalfalling away first, such as would occasion the rise of antichrist, thatman of sin. There have been great disputes who or what is intended bythis man of sin and son of perdition. The man of sin not only practiseswickedness, but also promotes and commands sin and wickedness inothers; and is the son of perdition, because he is devoted to certaindestruction, and is the instrument to destroy many others, both in souland body. As God was in the temple of old, and worshipped there, and isin and with his church now; so the antichrist here mentioned, is ausurper of God's authority in the Christian church, who claims Divinehonours.
2Th 2:5-12	<br>Something hindered or withheld the man of sin. It is supposed to be thepower of the Roman empire, which the apostle did not mention moreplainly at that time. Corruption of doctrine and worship came in bydegrees, and the usurping of power was gradual; thus the mystery ofiniquity prevailed. Superstition and idolatry were advanced bypretended devotion, and bigotry and persecution were promoted bypretended zeal for God and his glory. This mystery of iniquity was eventhen begun; while the apostles were yet living, persons pretended zealfor Christ, but really opposed him. The fall or ruin of theantichristian state is declared. The pure word of God, with the Spiritof God, will discover this mystery of iniquity, and in due time itshall be destroyed by the brightness of Christ's coming. Signs andwonders, visions and miracles, are pretended; but they are false signsto support false doctrines; and lying wonders, or only pretendedmiracles, to cheat the people; and the diabolical deceits with whichthe antichristian state has been supported, are notorious. The personsare described, who are his willing subjects. Their sin is this; Theydid not love the truth, and therefore did not believe it; and they werepleased with false notions. God leaves them to themselves, then sinwill follow of course, and spiritual judgments here, and eternalpunishments hereafter. These prophecies have, in a great measure, cometo pass, and confirm the truth of the Scriptures. This passage exactlyagrees with the system of popery, as it prevails in the Romish church,and under the Romish popes. But though the son of perdition has beenrevealed, though he has opposed and exalted himself above all that iscalled God, or that is worshipped; and has spoken and acted as if hewere a god upon earth, and has proclaimed his insolent pride, andsupported his delusions, by lying miracles and all kinds of frauds;still the Lord has not yet fully destroyed him with the brightness ofhis coming; that and other prophecies remain to be fulfilled before theend shall come.
2Th 2:13-15	<br>When we hear of the apostacy of many, it is a great comfort and joy,that there is a remnant according to the election of grace, which doesand shall persevere; especially we should rejoice, if we have reason tohope that we are of that number. The preservation of the saints, isbecause God loved them with an everlasting love, from the beginning ofthe world. The end and the means must not be separated. Faith andholiness must be joined together as well as holiness and happiness. Theoutward call of God is by the gospel; and this is rendered effectual bythe inward working of the Spirit. The belief of the truth brings thesinner to rely on Christ, and so to love and obey him; it is sealed bythe Holy Spirit upon his heart. We have no certain proof of any thinghaving been delivered by the apostles, more than what we find containedin the Holy Scriptures. Let us then stand fast in the doctrines taughtby the apostles, and reject all additions, and vain traditions.
2Th 2:16,17	<br>We may and should direct our prayers, not only to God the Father,through our Lord Jesus Christ, but also to our Lord Jesus Christhimself. And we should pray in his name unto God, not only as hisFather, but as our Father in and through him. The love of God in ChristJesus, is the spring and fountain of all the good we have or hope for.There is good reason for strong consolations, because the saints havegood hope through grace. The free grace and mercy of God are what theyhope for, and what their hopes are founded on, and not any worth ormerit of their own. The more pleasure we take in the word, and works,and ways of God, the more likely we shall be to persevere therein. But,if we are wavering in faith, and of a doubtful mind, halting andfaltering in our duty, no wonder that we are strangers to the joys ofreligion.
2Th 3:1-5	<br>Those who are far apart still may meet together at the throne of grace;and those not able to do or receive any other kindness, may in this waydo and receive real and very great kindness. Enemies to the preachingof the gospel, and persecutors of its faithful preachers, areunreasonable and wicked men. Many do not believe the gospel; and nowonder if such are restless and show malice in their endeavours tooppose it. The evil of sin is the greatest evil, but there are otherevils we need to be preserved from, and we have encouragement to dependupon the grace of God. When once the promise is made, the performanceis sure and certain. The apostle had confidence in them, but that wasfounded upon his confidence in God; for there is otherwise noconfidence in man. He prays for them for spiritual blessings. It is oursin and our misery, that we place our affections upon wrong objects.There is not true love of God, without faith in Jesus Christ. If, bythe special grace of God, we have that faith which multitudes have not,we should earnestly pray that we may be enabled, without reserve, toobey his commands, and that we may be enabled, without reserve, to thelove of God, and the patience of Christ.
2Th 3:6-15	<br>Those who have received the gospel, are to live according to thegospel. Such as could work, and would not, were not to be maintained inidleness. Christianity is not to countenance slothfulness, which wouldconsume what is meant to encourage the industrious, and to support thesick and afflicted. Industry in our callings as men, is a duty requiredby our calling as Christians. But some expected to be maintained inidleness, and indulged a curious and conceited temper. They meddledwith the concerns of others, and did much harm. It is a great error andabuse of religion, to make it a cloak for idleness or any other sin.The servant who waits for the coming of his Lord aright, must beworking as his Lord has commanded. If we are idle, the devil and acorrupt heart will soon find us somewhat to do. The mind of man is abusy thing; if it is not employed in doing good, it will be doing evil.It is an excellent, but rare union, to be active in our own business,yet quiet as to other people's. If any refused to labour withquietness, they were to note him with censure, and to separate from hiscompany, yet they were to seek his good by loving admonitions. TheLords is with you while you are with him. Hold on your way, and hold onto the end. We must never give over, or tire in our work. It will betime enough to rest when we come to heaven.
2Th 3:16-18	<br>The apostle prays for the Thessalonians. And let us desire the sameblessings for ourselves and our friends. Peace with God. This peace isdesired for them always, or in every thing. Peace by all means; inevery way; that, as they enjoyed the means of grace, they might use allmethods to secure peace. We need nothing more to make us safe andhappy, nor can we desire any thing better for ourselves and ourfriends, than to have God's gracious presence with us and them. Nomatter where we are, if God be with us; nor who is absent, if God bepresent. It is through the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that we hopeto have peace with God, and to enjoy the presence of God. This grace isall in all to make us happy; though we wish ever so much to others,there remains enough for ourselves.
1Ti 1:1-4	<br>Jesus Christ is a Christian's hope; all our hopes of eternal life arebuilt upon him; and Christ is in us the hope of glory. The apostleseems to have been the means of Timothy's conversion; who served withhim in his ministry, as a dutiful son with a loving father. That whichraises questions, is not for edifying; that which gives occasion fordoubtful disputes, pulls down the church rather than builds it up.Godliness of heart and life can only be kept up and increased, by theexercise of faith in the truths and promises of God, through JesusChrist.
1Ti 1:5-11	<br>Whatever tends to weaken love to God, or love to the brethren, tends todefeat the end of the commandment. The design of the gospel isanswered, when sinners, through repentance towards God and faith inJesus Christ, are brought to exercise Christian love. And as believerswere righteous persons in God's appointed way, the law was not againstthem. But unless we are made righteous by faith in Christ, reallyrepenting and forsaking sin, we are yet under the curse of the law,even according to the gospel of the blessed God, and are unfit to sharethe holy happiness of heaven.
1Ti 1:12-17	<br>The apostle knew that he would justly have perished, if the Lord hadbeen extreme to mark what was amiss; and also if his grace and mercyhad not been abundant to him when dead in sin, working faith and loveto Christ in his heart. This is a faithful saying; these are true andfaithful words, which may be depended on, That the Son of God came intothe world, willingly and purposely to save sinners. No man, with Paul'sexample before him, can question the love and power of Christ to savehim, if he really desires to trust in him as the Son of God, who oncedied on the cross, and now reigns upon the throne of glory, to save allthat come to God through him. Let us then admire and praise the graceof God our Saviour; and ascribe to the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost,three Persons in the unity of the Godhead, the glory of all done in,by, and for us.
1Ti 1:18-20	<br>The ministry is a warfare against sin and Satan; carried on under theLord Jesus, who is the Captain of our salvation. The good hopes othershave had of us, should stir us up to duty. And let us be upright in ourconduct in all things. The design of the highest censures in theprimitive church, was, to prevent further sin, and to reclaim thesinner. May all who are tempted to put away a good conscience, and toabuse the gospel, remember that this is the way to make shipwreck offaith also.
1Ti 2:1-7	<br>The disciples of Christ must be praying people; all, withoutdistinction of nation, sect, rank, or party. Our duty as Christians, issummed up in two words; godliness, that is, the right worshipping ofGod; and honesty, that is, good conduct toward all men. These must gotogether: we are not truly honest, if we are not godly, and do notrender to God his due; and we are not truly godly, if not honest. Whatis acceptable in the sight of God our Saviour, we should abound in.There is one Mediator, and that Mediator gave himself a ransom for all.And this appointment has been made for the benefit of the Jews and theGentiles of every nation; that all who are willing may come in thisway, to the mercy-seat of a pardoning God, to seek reconciliation withhim. Sin had made a quarrel between us and God; Jesus Christ is theMediator who makes peace. He is a ransom that was to be known in duetime. In the Old Testament times, his sufferings, and the glory thatshould follow, were spoken of as things to be revealed in the lasttimes. Those who are saved must come to the knowledge of the truth, forthat is God's appointed way to save sinners: if we do not know thetruth, we cannot be ruled by it.
1Ti 2:8-15	<br>Under the gospel, prayer is not to be confined to any one particularhouse of prayer, but men must pray every where. We must pray in ourclosets, pray in our families, pray at our meals, pray when we are onjourneys, and pray in the solemn assemblies, whether more public orprivate. We must pray in charity; without wrath, or malice, or anger atany person. We must pray in faith, without doubting, and withoutdisputing. Women who profess the Christian religion, must be modest inapparel, not affecting gaudiness, gaiety, or costliness. Good works arethe best ornament; these are, in the sight of God, of great price.Modesty and neatness are more to be consulted in garments than eleganceand fashion. And it would be well if the professors of seriousgodliness were wholly free from vanity in dress. They should spend moretime and money in relieving the sick and distressed, than in decoratingthemselves and their children. To do this in a manner unsuitable totheir rank in life, and their profession of godliness, is sinful. Theseare not trifles, but Divine commands. The best ornaments for professorsof godliness, are good works. According to St. Paul, women are notallowed to be public teachers in the church; for teaching is an officeof authority. But good women may and ought to teach their children athome the principles of true religion. Also, women must not thinkthemselves excused from learning what is necessary to salvation, thoughthey must not usurp authority. As woman was last in the creation, whichis one reason for her subjection, so she was first in thetransgression. But there is a word of comfort; that those who continuein sobriety, shall be saved in child-bearing, or with child-bearing, bythe Messiah, who was born of a woman. And the especial sorrow to whichthe female sex is subject, should cause men to exercise their authoritywith much gentleness, tenderness, and affection.
1Ti 3:1-7	<br>If a man desired the pastoral office, and from love to Christ, and thesouls of men, was ready to deny himself, and undergo hardships bydevoting himself to that service, he sought to be employed in a goodwork, and his desire should be approved, provided he was qualified forthe office. A minister must give as little occasion for blame as canbe, lest he bring reproach upon his office. He must be sober,temperate, moderate in all his actions, and in the use of allcreature-comforts. Sobriety and watchfulness are put together inScripture, they assist one the other. The families of ministers oughtto be examples of good to all other families. We should take heed ofpride; it is a sin that turned angels into devils. He must be of goodrepute among his neighbours, and under no reproach from his formerlife. To encourage all faithful ministers, we have Christ's graciousword of promise, Lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of theworld, Mt 28:20. And he will fit his ministers for their work, andcarry them through difficulties with comfort, and reward theirfaithfulness.
1Ti 3:8-13	<br>The deacons were at first appointed to distribute the charity of thechurch, and to manage its concerns, yet pastors and evangelists wereamong them. The deacons had a great trust reposed in them. They must begrave, serious, prudent men. It is not fit that public trusts should belodged in the hands of any, till they are found fit for the businesswith which they are to be trusted. All who are related to ministers,must take great care to walk as becomes the gospel of Christ.
1Ti 3:14-16	<br>The church is the house of God; he dwells there. The church holds forththe Scripture and the doctrine of Christ, as a pillar holds forth aproclamation. When a church ceases to be the pillar and ground oftruth, we may and ought to forsake her; for our regard to truth shouldbe first and greatest. The mystery of godliness is Christ. He is God,who was made flesh, and was manifest in the flesh. God was pleased tomanifest himself to man, by his own Son taking the nature of man.Though reproached as a sinner, and put to death as a malefactor, Christwas raised again by the Spirit, and so was justified from all the falsecharges with which he was loaded. Angels ministered to him, for he isthe Lord of angels. The Gentiles welcomed the gospel which the Jewsrejected. Let us remember that God was manifest in the flesh, to takeaway our sins, to redeem us from all iniquity, and to purify untohimself a peculiar people, zealous of good works. These doctrines mustbe shown forth by the fruits of the Spirit in our lives.
1Ti 4:1-5	<br>The Holy Spirit, both in the Old and the New Testament, spoke of ageneral turning from the faith of Christ, and the pure worship of God.This should come during the Christian dispensation, for those arecalled the latter days. False teachers forbid as evil what God hasallowed, and command as a duty what he has left indifferent. We findexercise for watchfulness and self-denial, in attending to therequirements of God's law, without being tasked to imaginary duties,which reject what he has allowed. But nothing justifies an intemperateor improper use of things; and nothing will be good to us, unless weseek by prayer for the Lord's blessing upon it.
1Ti 4:6-10	<br>Outward acts of self-denial profit little. What will it avail us tomortify the body, if we do not mortify sin? No diligence in mereoutward things could be of much use. The gain of godliness lies much inthe promise; and the promises to godly people relate partly to the lifethat now is, but especially to the life which is to come: though welose for Christ, we shall not lose by him. If Christ be thus theSaviour of all men, then much more will he be the Rewarder of those whoseek and serve him; he will provide well for those whom he has made newcreatures.
1Ti 4:11-16	<br>Men's youth will not be despised, if they keep from vanities andfollies. Those who teach by their doctrine, must teach by their life.Their discourse must be edifying; their conversation must be holy; theymust be examples of love to God and all good men, examples ofspiritual-mindedness. Ministers must mind these things as theirprincipal work and business. By this means their profiting will appearin all things, as well as to all persons; this is the way to profit inknowledge and grace, and also to profit others. The doctrine of aminister of Christ must be scriptural, clear, evangelical, andpractical; well stated, explained, defended, and applied. But theseduties leave no leisure for wordly pleasures, trifling visits, or idleconversation, and but little for what is mere amusement, and onlyornamental. May every believer be enabled to let his profiting appearunto all men; seeking to experience the power of the gospel in his ownsoul, and to bring forth its fruits in his life.
1Ti 5:1,2	<br>Respect must be paid to the dignity of years and place. The younger, iffaulty, must be rebuked, not as desirous to find fault with them, butas willing to make the best of them. There is need of much meekness andcare in reproving those who deserve reproof.
1Ti 5:3-8	<br>Honour widows that are widows indeed, relieve them, and maintain them.It is the duty of children, if their parents are in need, and they areable to relieve them, to do it to the utmost of their power. Widowhoodis a desolate state; but let widows trust in the Lord, and continue inprayer. All who live in pleasure, are dead while they live, spirituallydead, dead in trespasses and sins. Alas, what numbers there are of thisdescription among nominal Christians, even to the latest period oflife! If any men or women do not maintain their poor relations, they ineffect deny the faith. If they spend upon their lusts and pleasures,what should maintain their families, they have denied the faith, andare worse than infidels. If professors of the gospel give way to anycorrupt principle or conduct, they are worse than those who do notprofess to believe the doctrines of grace.
1Ti 5:9-16	<br>Every one brought into any office in the church, should be free fromjust censure; and many are proper objects of charity, yet ought not tobe employed in public services. Those who would find mercy when theyare in distress, must show mercy when they are in prosperity; and thosewho show most readiness for every good work, are most likely to befaithful in whatever is trusted to them. Those who are idle, veryseldom are only idle, they make mischief among neighbours, and sowdiscord among brethren. All believers are required to relieve thosebelonging to their families who are destitute, that the church may notbe prevented from relieving such as are entirely destitute andfriendless.
1Ti 5:17-25	<br>Care must be taken that ministers are maintained. And those who arelaborious in this work are worthy of double honour and esteem. It istheir just due, as much as the reward of the labourer. The apostlecharges Timothy solemnly to guard against partiality. We have greatneed to watch at all times, that we do not partake of other men's sins.Keep thyself pure, not only from doing the like thyself, but fromcountenancing it, or any way helping to it in others. The apostle alsocharges Timothy to take care of his health. As we are not to make ourbodies masters, so neither slaves; but to use them so that they may bemost helpful to us in the service of God. There are secret, and thereare open sins: some men's sins are open before-hand, and going beforeunto judgment; some they follow after. God will bring to light thehidden things of darkness, and make known the counsels of all hearts.Looking forward to the judgment-day, let us all attend to our properoffices, whether in higher or lower stations, studying that the nameand doctrine of God may never be blasphemed on our account.
1Ti 6:1-5	<br>Christians were not to suppose that religious knowledge, or Christianprivileges, gave them any right to despise heathen masters, or todisobey lawful commands, or to expose their faults to others. And suchas enjoyed the privilege of living with believing masters, were not towithhold due respect and reverence, because they were equal in respectto religious privileges, but were to serve with double diligence andcheerfulness, because of their faith in Christ, and as partakers of hisfree salvation. We are not to consent to any words as wholesome, exceptthe words of our Lord Jesus Christ; to these we must give unfeignedconsent. Commonly those are most proud who know least; for they do notknow themselves. Hence come envy, strife, railings, evil-surmisings,disputes that are all subtlety, and of no solidity, between men ofcorrupt and carnal minds, ignorant of the truth and its sanctifyingpower, and seeking their worldly advantage. (1Ti 6:6-10)
1Ti 6:6-10	<br>Those that make a trade of Christianity to serve their turn for thisworld, will be disappointed; but those who mind it as their calling,will find it has the promise of the life that now is, as well as ofthat which is to come. He that is godly, is sure to be happy in anotherworld; and if contented with his condition in this world, he hasenough; and all truly godly people are content. When brought into thegreatest straits, we cannot be poorer than when we came into thisworld; a shroud, a coffin, and a grave, are all that the richest man inthe world can have from all his wealth. If nature should be contentwith a little, grace should be content with less. The necessaries oflife bound a true Christian's desires, and with these he will endeavourto be content. We see here the evil of covetousness. It is not said,they that are rich, but they will be rich; who place their happiness inwealth, and are eager and determined in the pursuit. Those that aresuch, give to Satan the opportunity of tempting them, leading them touse dishonest means, and other bad practices, to add to their gains.Also, leading into so many employments, and such a hurry of business,as leave no time or inclination for spiritual religion; leading toconnexions that draw into sin and folly. What sins will not men bedrawn into by the love of money! People may have money, and yet notlove it; but if they love it, this will push them on to all evil. Everysort of wickedness and vice, in one way or another, grows from the loveof money. We cannot look around without perceiving many proofs of this,especially in a day of outward prosperity, great expenses, and looseprofession.
1Ti 6:11-16	<br>It ill becomes any men, but especially men of God, to set their heartsupon the things of this world; men of God should be taken up with thethings of God. There must be a conflict with corruption, andtemptations, and the powers of darkness. Eternal life is the crownproposed for our encouragement. We are called to lay hold thereon. Tothe rich must especially be pointed out their dangers and duties, as tothe proper use of wealth. But who can give such a charge, that is nothimself above the love of things that wealth can buy? The appearing ofChrist is certain, but it is not for us to know the time. Mortal eyescannot bear the brightness of the Divine glory. None can approach himexcept as he is made known unto sinners in and by Christ. The Godheadis here adored without distinction of Persons, as all these things areproperly spoken, whether of the Father, the Son, or the Holy Ghost. Godis revealed to us, only in and through the human nature of Christ, asthe only begotten Son of the Father.
1Ti 6:17-21	<br>Being rich in this world is wholly different from being rich towardsGod. Nothing is more uncertain than worldly wealth. Those who are rich,must see that God gives them their riches; and he only can give toenjoy them richly; for many have riches, but enjoy them poorly, nothaving a heart to use them. What is the best estate worth, more than asit gives opportunity of doing the more good? Showing faith in Christ byfruits of love, let us lay hold on eternal life, when theself-indulgent, covetous, and ungodly around, lift up their eyes intorment. That learning which opposes the truth of the gospel, is nottrue science, or real knowledge, or it would approve the gospel, andconsent to it. Those who advance reason above faith, are in danger ofleaving faith. Grace includes all that is good, and grace is anearnest, a beginning of glory; wherever God gives grace, he will giveglory.
2Ti 1:1-5	<br>The promise of eternal life to believers in Christ Jesus, is theleading subject of ministers who are employed according to the will ofGod. The blessings here named, are the best we can ask for our belovedfriends, that they may have peace with God the Father and Christ Jesusour Lord. Whatever good we do, God must have the glory. True believershave in every age the same religion as to substance. Their faith isunfeigned; it will stand the trial, and it dwells in them as a livingprinciple. Thus pious women may take encouragement from the success ofLois and Eunice with Timothy, who proved so excellent and useful aminister. Some of the most worthy and valuable ministers the church ofChrist has been favoured with, have had to bless God for earlyreligious impressions made upon their minds by the teaching of theirmothers or other female relatives.
2Ti 1:6-14	<br>God has not given us the spirit of fear, but the spirit of power, ofcourage and resolution, to meet difficulties and dangers; the spirit oflove to him, which will carry us through opposition. And the spirit ofa sound mind, quietness of mind. The Holy Spirit is not the author of atimid or cowardly disposition, or of slavish fears. We are likely tobear afflictions well, when we have strength and power from God toenable us to bear them. As is usual with Paul, when he mentions Christand his redemption, he enlarges upon them; so full was he of that whichis all our salvation, and ought to be all our desire. The call of thegospel is a holy call, making holy. Salvation is of free grace. This issaid to be given us before the world began, that is, in the purpose ofGod from all eternity; in Christ Jesus, for all the gifts that comefrom God to sinful man, come in and through Christ Jesus alone. And asthere is so clear a prospect of eternal happiness by faith in Him, whois the Resurrection and the Life, let us give more diligence in makinghis salvation sure to our souls. Those who cleave to the gospel, neednot be ashamed, the cause will bear them out; but those who oppose it,shall be ashamed. The apostle had trusted his life, his soul, andeternal interests, to the Lord Jesus. No one else could deliver andsecure his soul through the trials of life and death. There is a daycoming, when our souls will be inquired after. Thou hadst a soulcommitted to thee; how was it employed? in the service of sin, or inthe service of Christ? The hope of the lowest real Christian rests onthe same foundation as that of the great apostle. He also has learnedthe value and the danger of his soul; he also has believed in Christ;and the change wrought in his soul, convinces the believer that theLord Jesus will keep him to his heavenly kingdom. Paul exhorts Timothyto hold fast the Holy Scriptures, the substance of solid gospel truthin them. It is not enough to assent to the sound words, but we mustlove them. The Christian doctrine is a trust committed to us; it is ofunspeakable value in itself, and will be of unspeakable advantage tous. It is committed to us, to be preserved pure and entire, yet we mustnot think to keep it by our own strength, but by the power of the HolySpirit dwelling in us; and it will not be gained by those who trust intheir own hearts, and lean to their own understandings. (2Ti 1:15-18)
2Ti 1:15-18	<br>The apostle mentions the constancy of Onesiphorus; he oft refreshed himwith his letters, and counsels, and comforts, and was not ashamed ofhim. A good man will seek to do good. The day of death and judgment isan awful day. And if we would have mercy then, we must seek for it nowof the Lord. The best we can ask, for ourselves or our friends, is,that the Lord will grant that we and they may find mercy of the Lord,when called to pass out of time into eternity, and to appear before thejudgment seat of Christ.
2Ti 2:1-7	<br>As our trials increase, we need to grow stronger in that which is good;our faith stronger, our resolution stronger, our love to God and Christstronger. This is opposed to our being strong in our own strength. AllChristians, but especially ministers, must be faithful to theirCaptain, and resolute in his cause. The great care of a Christian mustbe to please Christ. We are to strive to get the mastery of our lustsand corruptions, but we cannot expect the prize unless we observe thelaws. We must take care that we do good in a right manner, that ourgood may not be spoken evil of. Some who are active, spend their zealabout outward forms and doubtful disputations. But those who strivelawfully shall be crowned at last. If we would partake the fruits, wemust labour; if we would gain the prize, we must run the race. We mustdo the will of God, before we receive the promises, for which reason wehave need of patience. Together with our prayers for others, that theLord would give them understanding in all things, we must exhort andstir them up to consider what they hear or read.
2Ti 2:8-13	<br>Let suffering saints remember, and look to Jesus, the Author andFinisher of their faith, who for the joy that was set before him,endured the cross, despised the shame, and is now set down at the righthand of the throne of God. We must not think it strange if the best menmeet with the worst treatment; but this is cheering, that the word ofGod is not bound. Here we see the real and true cause of the apostle'ssuffering trouble in, or for, the sake of the gospel. If we are dead tothis world, its pleasures, profits, and honours, we shall be for everwith Christ in a better world. He is faithful to his threatenings, andfaithful to his promises. This truth makes sure the unbeliever'scondemnation, and the believer's salvation.
2Ti 2:14-21	<br>Those disposed to strive, commonly strive about matters of smallmoment. But strifes of words destroy the things of God. The apostlementions some who erred. They did not deny the resurrection, but theycorrupted that true doctrine. Yet nothing can be so foolish orerroneous, but it will overturn the temporary faith of some professors.This foundation has two writings on it. One speaks our comfort. Nonecan overthrow the faith of any whom God hath chosen. The other speaksour duty. Those who would have the comfort of the privilege, must makeconscience of the duty Christ gave himself for us, that he might redeemus from all iniquity, Tit 2:14. The church of Christ is like adwelling: some furniture is of great value; some of smaller value, andput to meaner uses. Some professors of religion are like vessels ofwood and earth. When the vessels of dishonour are cast out to bedestroyed, the others will be filled with all the fulness of God. Wemust see to it that we are holy vessels. Every one in the church whomGod approves, will be devoted to his Master's service, and thus fittedfor his use.
2Ti 2:22-26	<br>The more we follow that which is good, the faster and the further weshall flee from that which is evil. The keeping up the communion ofsaints, will take us from fellowship with unfruitful works of darkness.See how often the apostle cautions against disputes in religion; whichsurely shows that religion consists more in believing and practisingwhat God requires, than in subtle disputes. Those are unapt to teach,who are apt to strive, and are fierce and froward. Teaching, notpersecution, is the Scripture method of dealing with those in error.The same God who gives the discovery of the truth, by his grace bringsus to acknowledge it, otherwise our hearts would continue to rebelagainst it. There is no "peradventure," in respect of God's pardoningthose who do repent; but we cannot tell that he will give repentance tothose who oppose his will. Sinners are taken in a snare, and in theworst snare, because it is the devil's; they are slaves to him. And ifany long for deliverance, let them remember they never can escape,except by repentance, which is the gift of God; and we must ask it ofhim by earnest, persevering prayer.
2Ti 3:1-9	<br>Even in gospel times there would be perilous times; on account ofpersecution from without, still more on account of corruptions within.Men love to gratify their own lusts, more than to please God and dotheir duty. When every man is eager for what he can get, and anxious tokeep what he has, this makes men dangerous to one another. When men donot fear God, they will not regard man. When children are disobedientto their parents, that makes the times perilous. Men are unholy andwithout the fear of God, because unthankful for the mercies of God. Weabuse God's gifts, if we make them the food and fuel of our lusts.Times are perilous also, when parents are without natural affection tochildren. And when men have no rule over their own spirits, but despisethat which is good and to be honoured. God is to be loved above all;but a carnal mind, full of enmity against him, prefers any thing beforehim, especially carnal pleasure. A form of godliness is very differentfrom the power; from such as are found to be hypocrites, realChristians must withdraw. Such persons have been found within theoutward church, in every place, and at all times. There ever have beenartful men, who, by pretences and flatteries, creep into the favour andconfidence of those who are too easy of belief, ignorant, and fanciful.All must be ever learning to know the Lord; but these follow every newnotion, yet never seek the truth as it is in Jesus. Like the Egyptianmagicians, these were men of corrupt minds, prejudiced against thetruth, and found to be quite without faith. Yet though the spirit oferror may be let loose for a time, Satan can deceive the nations andthe churches no further, and no longer, than God will permit.
2Ti 3:10-13	<br>The more fully we know the doctrine of Christ, as taught by theapostles, the more closely we shall cleave to it. When we know theafflictions of believers only in part, they tempt us to decline thecause for which they suffer. A form of godliness, a profession ofChristian faith without a godly life, often is allowed to pass, whileopen profession of the truth as it is in Jesus, and resolute attentionto the duties of godliness, stir up the scorn and enmity of the world.As good men, by the grace of God, grow better, so bad men, through thecraft of Satan, and the power of their own corruptions, grow worse. Theway of sin is down-hill; such go on from bad to worse, deceiving andbeing deceived. Those who deceive others, deceive themselves, as theywill find at last, to their cost. The history of the outward church,awfully shows that the apostle spake this as he was moved by the HolyGhost.
2Ti 3:14-17	<br>Those who would learn the things of God, and be assured of them, mustknow the Holy Scriptures, for they are the Divine revelation. The ageof children is the age to learn; and those who would get true learning,must get it out of the Scriptures. They must not lie by us neglected,seldom or never looked into. The Bible is a sure guide to eternal life.The prophets and apostles did not speak from themselves, but deliveredwhat they received of God, 2Pe 1:21. It is profitable for all purposesof the Christian life. It is of use to all, for all need to be taught,corrected, and reproved. There is something in the Scriptures suitablefor every case. Oh that we may love our Bibles more, and keep closer tothem! then shall we find benefit, and at last gain the happinesstherein promised by faith in our Lord Jesus Christ, who is the mainsubject of both Testaments. We best oppose error by promoting a solidknowledge of the word of truth; and the greatest kindness we can do tochildren, is to make them early to know the Bible.
2Ti 4:1-5	<br>People will turn away from the truth, they will grow weary of the plaingospel of Christ, they will be greedy of fables, and take pleasure inthem. People do so when they will not endure that preaching which issearching, plain, and to the purpose. Those who love souls must be everwatchful, must venture and bear all the painful effects of theirfaithfulness, and take all opportunities of making known the puregospel.
2Ti 4:6-8	<br>The blood of the martyrs, though not a sacrifice of atonement, yet wasa sacrifice of acknowledgment to the grace of God and his truth. Deathto a good man, is his release from the imprisonment of this world, andhis departure to the enjoyments of another world. As a Christian, and aminister, Paul had kept the faith, kept the doctrines of the gospel.What comfort will it afford, to be able to speak in this manner towardthe end of our days! The crown of believers is a crown ofrighteousness, purchased by the righteousness of Christ. Believers haveit not at present, yet it is sure, for it is laid up for them. Thebeliever, amidst poverty, pain, sickness, and the agonies of death, mayrejoice; but if the duties of a man's place and station are neglected,his evidence of interest in Christ will be darkened, and uncertaintyand distress may be expected to cloud and harass his last hours.
2Ti 4:9-13	<br>The love of this world, is often the cause of turning back from thetruths and ways of Jesus Christ. Paul was guided by Divine inspiration,yet he would have his books. As long as we live, we must still learn.The apostles did not neglect human means, in seeking the necessaries oflife, or their own instruction. Let us thank the Divine goodness inhaving given us so many writings of wise and pious men in all ages; andlet us seek that by reading them our profiting may appear to all.
2Ti 4:14-18	<br>There is as much danger from false brethren, as from open enemies. Itis dangerous having to do with those who would be enemies to such a manas Paul. The Christians at Rome were forward to meet him, Ac 28, butwhen there seemed to be a danger of suffering with him, then allforsook him. God might justly be angry with them, but he prays God toforgive them. The apostle was delivered out of the mouth of the lion,that is, of Nero, or some of his judges. If the Lord stands by us, hewill strengthen us in difficulties and dangers, and his presence willmore than supply every one's absence.
2Ti 4:19-22	<br>We need no more to make us happy, than to have the Lord Jesus Christwith our spirits; for in him all spiritual blessings are summed up. Itis the best prayer we can offer for our friends, that the Lord JesusChrist may be with their spirits, to sanctify and save them, and atlast to receive them to himself. Many who believed as Paul, are nowbefore the throne, giving glory to their Lord: may we be followers ofthem.
Tit 1:1-4	<br>All are the servants of God who are not slaves of sin and Satan. Allgospel truth is according to godliness, teaching the fear of God. Theintent of the gospel is to raise up hope as well as faith; to take offthe mind and heart from the world, and to raise them to heaven and thethings above. How excellent then is the gospel, which was the matter ofDivine promise so early, and what thanks are due for our privileges!Faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of God; and whoso isappointed and called, must preach the word. Grace is the free favour ofGod, and acceptance with him. Mercy, the fruits of the favour, in thepardon of sin, and freedom from all miseries both here and hereafter.And peace is the effect and fruit of mercy. Peace with God throughChrist who is our Peace, and with the creatures and ourselves. Grace isthe fountain of all blessings. Mercy, and peace, and all good, springout of this.
Tit 1:5-9	<br>The character and qualification of pastors, here called elders andbishops, agree with what the apostle wrote to Timothy. Being suchbishops and overseers of the flock, to be examples to them, and God'sstewards to take care of the affairs of his household, there is greatreason that they should be blameless. What they are not to be, isplainly shown, as well as what they are to be, as servants of Christ,and able ministers of the letter and practice of the gospel. And hereare described the spirit and practice becoming such as should beexamples of good works.
Tit 1:10-16	<br>False teachers are described. Faithful ministers must oppose such ingood time, that their folly being made manifest, they may go no furtherThey had a base end in what they did; serving a worldly interest underpretence of religion: for the love of money is the root of all evil.Such should be resisted, and put to shame, by sound doctrine from theScriptures. Shameful actions, the reproach of heathens, should be farfrom Christians; falsehood and lying, envious craft and cruelty, brutaland sensual practices, and idleness and sloth, are sins condemned evenby the light of nature. But Christian meekness is as far from cowardlypassing over sin and error, as from anger and impatience. And thoughthere may be national differences of character, yet the heart of man inevery age and place is deceitful and desperately wicked. But thesharpest reproofs must aim at the good of the reproved; and soundnessin the faith is most desirable and necessary. To those who are defiledand unbelieving, nothing is pure; they abuse, and turn things lawfuland good into sin. Many profess to know God, yet in their lives denyand reject him. See the miserable state of hypocrites, such as have aform of godliness, but are without the power; yet let us not be soready to fix this charge on others, as careful that it does not applyto ourselves.
Tit 2:1-8	<br>Old disciples of Christ must behave in every thing agreeably to theChristian doctrine. That the aged men be sober; not thinking that thedecays of nature will justify any excess; but seeking comfort fromnearer communion with God, not from any undue indulgence. Faith worksby, and must be seen in love, of God for himself, and of men for God'ssake. Aged persons are apt to be peevish and fretful; therefore need tobe on their guard. Though there is not express Scripture for everyword, or look, yet there are general rules, according to which all mustbe ordered. Young women must be sober and discreet; for many exposethemselves to fatal temptations by what at first might be only want ofdiscretion. The reason is added, that the word of God may not beblasphemed. Failures in duties greatly reproach Christianity. Young menare apt to be eager and thoughtless, therefore must be earnestly calledupon to be sober-minded: there are more young people ruined by pridethan by any other sin. Every godly man's endeavour must be to stop themouths of adversaries. Let thine own conscience answer for thineuprightness. What a glory is it for a Christian, when that mouth whichwould fain open itself against him, cannot find any evil in him tospeak of!
Tit 2:9,10	<br>Servants must know and do their duty to their earthly masters, with areference to their heavenly one. In serving an earthly master accordingto Christ's will, He is served; such shall be rewarded by him. Notgiving disrespectful or provoking language; but to take a check orreproof with silence, not making confident or bold replies. Whenconscious of a fault, to excuse or justify it, doubles it. Neverputting to their own use that which is their master's, nor wasting thegoods they are trusted with. Showing all good fidelity to improve amaster's goods, and promote his thriving. If ye have not been faithfulin that which is another man's, who shall give you that which is yourown? Lu 16:12. True religion is an honour to the professors of it; andthey should adorn it in all things.
Tit 2:11-15	<br>The doctrine of grace and salvation by the gospel, is for all ranks andconditions of men. It teaches to forsake sin; to have no more to dowith it. An earthly, sensual conversation suits not a heavenly calling.It teaches to make conscience of that which is good. We must look toGod in Christ, as the object of our hope and worship. A gospelconversation must be a godly conversation. See our duty in a very fewwords; denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, living soberly,righteously, and godly, notwithstanding all snares, temptations,corrupt examples, ill usage, and what remains of sin in the believer'sheart, with all their hinderances. It teaches to look for the gloriesof another world. At, and in, the glorious appearing of Christ, theblessed hope of Christians will be complete: To bring us to holinessand happiness was the end of Christ's death. Jesus Christ, that greatGod and our Saviour, who saves not only as God, much less as Man alone;but as God-man, two natures in one person. He loved us, and gavehimself for us; and what can we do less than love and give up ourselvesto him! Redemption from sin and sanctification of the nature gotogether, and make a peculiar people unto God, free from guilt andcondemnation, and purified by the Holy Spirit. All Scripture isprofitable. Here is what will furnish for all parts of duty, and theright discharge of them. Let us inquire whether our whole dependence isplaced upon that grace which saves the lost, pardons the guilty, andsanctifies the unclean. And the further we are removed from boasting offancied good works, or trusting in them, so that we glory in Christalone, the more zealous shall we be to abound in real good works.
Tit 3:1-7	<br>Spiritual privileges do not make void or weaken, but confirm civilduties. Mere good words and good meanings are not enough without goodworks. They were not to be quarrelsome, but to show meekness on alloccasions, not toward friends only, but to all men, though with wisdom,Jas 3:13. And let this text teach us how wrong it is for a Christian tobe churlish to the worst, weakest, and most abject. The servants of sinhave many masters, their lusts hurry them different ways; pridecommands one thing, covetousness another. Thus they are hateful,deserving to be hated. It is the misery of sinners, that they hate oneanother; and it is the duty and happiness of saints to love oneanother. And we are delivered out of our miserable condition, only bythe mercy and free grace of God, the merit and sufferings of Christ,and the working of his Spirit. God the Father is God our Saviour. He isthe fountain from which the Holy Spirit flows, to teach, regenerate,and save his fallen creatures; and this blessing comes to mankindthrough Christ. The spring and rise of it, is the kindness and love ofGod to man. Love and grace have, through the Spirit, great power tochange and turn the heart to God. Works must be in the saved, but arenot among the causes of their salvation. A new principle of grace andholiness is wrought, which sways, and governs, and makes the man a newcreature. Most pretend they would have heaven at last, yet they carenot for holiness now; they would have the end without the beginning.Here is the outward sign and seal thereof in baptism, called thereforethe washing of regeneration. The work is inward and spiritual; this isoutwardly signified and sealed in this ordinance. Slight not thisoutward sign and seal; yet rest not in the outward washing, but look tothe answer of a good conscience, without which the outward washing willavail nothing. The worker therein is the Spirit of God; it is therenewing of the Holy Ghost. Through him we mortify sin, perform duty,walk in God's ways; all the working of the Divine life in us, and thefruits of righteousness without, are through this blessed and holySpirit. The Spirit and his saving gifts and graces, come throughChrist, as a Saviour, whose undertaking and work are to bring to graceand glory. Justification, in the gospel sense, is the free forgivenessof a sinner; accepting him as righteous through the righteousness ofChrist received by faith. God, in justifying a sinner in the way of thegospel, is gracious to him, yet just to himself and his law. Asforgiveness is through a perfect righteousness, and satisfaction ismade to justice by Christ, it cannot be merited by the sinner himself.Eternal life is set before us in the promise; the Spirit works faith inus, and hope of that life; faith and hope bring it near, and fill withjoy in expectation of it.
Tit 3:8-11	<br>When the grace of God towards mankind has been declared, the necessityof good works is pressed. Those who believe in God, must make it theircare to maintain good works, to seek opportunities for doing them,being influenced by love and gratitude. Trifling, foolish questionsmust be avoided, and subtle distinctions and vain inquiries; nor shouldpeople be eager after novelties, but love sound doctrine which tendsmost to edifying. Though we may now think some sins light and little,if the Lord awaken the conscience, we shall feel even the smallest sinheavy upon our souls.
Tit 3:12-15	<br>Christianity is not a fruitless profession; and its professors must befilled with the fruits of righteousness, which are by Jesus Christ, tothe glory and praise of God. They must be doing good, as well askeeping away from evil. Let "ours" follow some honest labour andemployment, to provide for themselves and their families. Christianityobliges all to seek some honest work and calling, and therein to abidewith God. The apostle concludes with expressions of kind regard andfervent prayer. Grace be with you all; the love and favour of God, withthe fruits and effects thereof, according to need; and the increase andfeeling of them more and more in your souls. This is the apostle's wishand prayer, showing his affection to them, and desire for their good,and would be a means of obtaining for them, and bringing down on them,the thing requested. Grace is the chief thing to be wished and prayedfor, with respect to ourselves or others; it is "all good."
Phm 1:1-7	<br>Faith in Christ, and love to him, should unite saints more closely thanany outward relation can unite the people of the world. Paul in hisprivate prayers was particular in remembering his friends. We mustremember Christian friends much and often, as their cases may need,bearing them in our thoughts, and upon our hearts, before our God.Different sentiments and ways in what is not essential, must not makedifference of affection, as to the truth. He inquired concerning hisfriends, as to the truth, growth, and fruitfulness of their graces,their faith in Christ, and love to him, and to all the saints. The goodwhich Philemon did, was matter of joy and comfort to him and others,who therefore desired that he would continue and abound in good fruits,more and more, to God's honour.
Phm 1:8-14	<br>It does not lower any one to condescend, and sometimes even to beseech,where, in strictness of right, we might command: the apostle arguesfrom love, rather than authority, in behalf of one converted throughhis means; and this was Onesimus. In allusion to that name, whichsignifies "profitable," the apostle allows that in time past he hadbeen unprofitable to Philemon, but hastens to mention the change bywhich he had become profitable. Unholy persons are unprofitable; theyanswer not the great end of their being. But what happy changesconversion makes! of evil, good; of unprofitable, useful. Religiousservants are treasures in a family. Such will make conscience of theirtime and trusts, and manage all they can for the best. No prospect ofusefulness should lead any to neglect their obligations, or to fail inobedience to superiors. One great evidence of true repentance consistsin returning to practise the duties which have been neglected. In hisunconverted state, Onesimus had withdrawn, to his master's injury; butnow he had seen his sin and repented, he was willing and desirous toreturn to his duty. Little do men know for what purposes the Lordleaves some to change their situations, or engage in undertakings,perhaps from evil motives. Had not the Lord overruled some of ourungodly projects, we may reflect upon cases, in which our destructionmust have been sure.
Phm 1:15-22	<br>When we speak of the nature of any sin or offence against God, the evilof it is not to be lessened; but in a penitent sinner, as God coversit, so must we. Such changed characters often become a blessing to allamong whom they reside. Christianity does not do away our duties toothers, but directs to the right doing of them. True penitents will beopen in owning their faults, as doubtless Onesimus had been to Paul,upon his being awakened and brought to repentance; especially in casesof injury done to others. The communion of saints does not destroydistinction of property. This passage is an instance of that beingimputed to one, which is contracted by another; and of one becominganswerable for another, by a voluntary engagement, that he might befreed from the punishment due to his crimes, according to the doctrinethat Christ of his own will bore the punishment of our sins, that wemight receive the reward of his righteousness. Philemon was Paul's sonin the faith, yet he entreated him as a brother. Onesimus was a poorslave, yet Paul besought for him as if seeking some great thing forhimself. Christians should do what may give joy to the hearts of oneanother. From the world they expect trouble; they should find comfortand joy in one another. When any of our mercies are taken away, ourtrust and hope must be in God. We must diligently use the means, and ifno other should be at hand, abound in prayer. Yet, though prayerprevails, it does not merit the things obtained. And if Christians donot meet on earth, still the grace of the Lord Jesus will be with theirspirits, and they will soon meet before the throne to join for ever inadmiring the riches of redeeming love. The example of Onesimus mayencourage the vilest sinners to return to God, but it is shamefullyprevented, if any are made bold thereby to persist in evil courses. Arenot many taken away in their sins, while others become more hardened?Resist not present convictions, lest they return no more.
Phm 1:23-25	<br>Never have believers found more enjoyment of God, than when sufferingtogether for him. Grace is the best wish for ourselves and others; withthis the apostle begins and ends. All grace is from Christ; hepurchased, and he bestows it. What need we more to make us happy, thanto have the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ with our spirit? Let us dothat now, which we should do at the last breath. Then men are ready torenounce the world, and to prefer the least portion of grace and faithbefore a kingdom.
Heb 1:1-3	<br>God spake to his ancient people at sundry times, through successivegenerations, and in divers manners, as he thought proper; sometimes bypersonal directions, sometimes by dreams, sometimes by visions,sometimes by Divine influences on the minds of the prophets. The gospelrevelation is excellent above the former; in that it is a revelationwhich God has made by his Son. In beholding the power, wisdom, andgoodness of the Lord Jesus Christ, we behold the power, wisdom, andgoodness of the Father, Joh 14:7; the fulness of the Godhead dwells,not typically, or in a figure, but really, in him. When, on the fall ofman, the world was breaking to pieces under the wrath and curse of God,the Son of God, undertaking the work of redemption, sustained it by hisalmighty power and goodness. From the glory of the person and office ofChrist, we proceed to the glory of his grace. The glory of His personand nature, gave to his sufferings such merit as was a fullsatisfaction to the honour of God, who suffered an infinite injury andaffront by the sins of men. We never can be thankful enough that Godhas in so many ways, and with such increasing clearness, spoken to usfallen sinners concerning salvation. That he should by himself cleanseus from our sins is a wonder of love beyond our utmost powers ofadmiration, gratitude, and praise.
Heb 1:4-14	<br>Many Jews had a superstitious or idolatrous respect for angels, becausethey had received the law and other tidings of the Divine will by theirministry. They looked upon them as mediators between God and men, andsome went so far as to pay them a kind of religious homage or worship.Thus it was necessary that the apostle should insist, not only onChrist's being the Creator of all things, and therefore of angelsthemselves, but as being the risen and exalted Messiah in human nature,to whom angels, authorities, and powers are made subject. To provethis, several passages are brought from the Old Testament. On comparingwhat God there says of the angels, with what he says to Christ, theinferiority of the angels to Christ plainly appears. Here is the officeof the angels; they are God's ministers or servants, to do hispleasure. But, how much greater things are said of Christ by theFather! And let us own and honour him as God; for if he had not beenGod, he had never done the Mediator's work, and had never worn theMediator's crown. It is declared how Christ was qualified for theoffice of Mediator, and how he was confirmed in it: he has the nameMessiah from his being anointed. Only as Man he has his fellows, and asanointed with the Holy Spirit; but he is above all prophets, priests,and kings, that ever were employed in the service of God on earth.Another passage of Scripture, Ps 102:25-27, is recited, in which theAlmighty power of the Lord Jesus Christ is declared, both in creatingthe world and in changing it. Christ will fold up this world as agarment, not to be abused any longer, not to be used as it has been. Asa sovereign, when his garments of state are folded and put away, is asovereign still, so our Lord, when he has laid aside the earth andheavens like a vesture, shall be still the same. Let us not then setour hearts upon that which is not what we take it to be, and will notbe what it now is. Sin has made a great change in the world for theworse, and Christ will make a great change in it for the better. Letthe thoughts of this make us watchful, diligent, and desirous of thatbetter world. The Saviour has done much to make all men his friends,yet he has enemies. But they shall be made his footstool, by humblesubmission, or by utter destruction. Christ shall go on conquering andto conquer. The most exalted angels are but ministering spirits, mereservants of Christ, to execute his commands. The saints, at present,are heirs, not yet come into possession. The angels minister to them inopposing the malice and power of evil spirits, in protecting andkeeping their bodies, instructing and comforting their souls, underChrist and the Holy Ghost. Angels shall gather all the saints togetherat the last day, when all whose hearts and hopes are set upon perishingtreasures and fading glories, will be driven from Christ's presenceinto everlasting misery.
Heb 2:1-4	<br>Christ being proved to be superior to the angels, this doctrine isapplied. Our minds and memories are like a leaky vessel, they do not,without much care, retain what is poured into them. This proceeds fromthe corruption of our nature, temptations, worldly cares, andpleasures. Sinning against the gospel is neglect of this greatsalvation; it is a contempt of the saving grace of God in Christ,making light of it, not caring for it, not regarding either the worthof gospel grace, or the want of it, and our undone state without it.The Lord's judgments under the gospel dispensation are chieflyspiritual, but are on that account the more to be dreaded. Here is anappeal to the consciences of sinners. Even partial neglects will notescape rebukes; they often bring darkness on the souls they do notfinally ruin. The setting forth the gospel was continued and confirmedby those who heard Christ, by the evangelists and apostles, who werewitnesses of what Jesus Christ began both to do and to teach; and bythe gifts of the Holy Ghost, qualified for the work to which they werecalled. And all this according to God's own will. It was the will ofGod that we should have sure ground for our faith, and a strongfoundation for our hope in receiving the gospel. Let us mind this onething needful, and attend to the Holy Scriptures, written by those whoheard the words of our gracious Lord, and were inspired by his Spirit;then we shall be blessed with the good part that cannot be taken away.
Heb 2:5-9	<br>Neither the state in which the church is at present, nor its morecompletely restored state, when the prince of this world shall be castout, and the kingdoms of the earth become the kingdom of Christ, isleft to the government of the angels: Christ will take to him his greatpower, and will reign. And what is the moving cause of all the kindnessGod shows to men in giving Christ for them and to them? it is the graceof God. As a reward of Christ's humiliation in suffering death, he hasunlimited dominion over all things; thus this ancient scripture wasfulfilled in him. Thus God has done wonderful things for us in creationand providence, but for these we have made the basest returns.
Heb 2:10-13	<br>Whatever the proud, carnal, and unbelieving may imagine or object, thespiritual mind will see peculiar glory in the cross of Christ, and besatisfied that it became Him, who in all things displays his ownperfections in bringing many sons to glory, to make the Author of theirsalvation perfect through sufferings. His way to the crown was by thecross, and so must that of his people be. Christ sanctifies; he haspurchased and sent the sanctifying Spirit: the Spirit sanctifies as theSpirit of Christ. True believers are sanctified, endowed with holyprinciples and powers, set apart to high and holy uses and purposes.Christ and believers are all of one heavenly Father, who is God. Theyare brought into relation with Christ. But the words, his not beingashamed to call them brethren, express the high superiority of Christto the human nature. This is shown from three texts of Scripture. SeePs 22:22; 18:2; Isa 8:18.
Heb 2:14-18	<br>The angels fell, and remained without hope or help. Christ neverdesigned to be the Saviour of the fallen angels, therefore he did nottake their nature; and the nature of angels could not be an atoningsacrifice for the sin of man. Here is a price paid, enough for all, andsuitable to all, for it was in our nature. Here the wonderful love ofGod appeared, that, when Christ knew what he must suffer in our nature,and how he must die in it, yet he readily took it upon him. And thisatonement made way for his people's deliverance from Satan's bondage,and for the pardon of their sins through faith. Let those who dreaddeath, and strive to get the better of their terrors, no longer attemptto outbrave or to stifle them, no longer grow careless or wickedthrough despair. Let them not expect help from the world, or humandevices; but let them seek pardon, peace, grace, and a lively hope ofheaven, by faith in Him who died and rose again, that thus they mayrise above the fear of death. The remembrance of his own sorrows andtemptations, makes Christ mindful of the trials of his people, andready to help them. He is ready and willing to succour those who aretempted, and seek him. He became man, and was tempted, that he might beevery way qualified to succour his people, seeing that he had passedthrough the same temptations himself, but continued perfectly free fromsin. Then let not the afflicted and tempted despond, or give place toSatan, as if temptations made it wrong for them to come to the Lord inprayer. Not soul ever perished under temptation, that cried unto theLord from real alarm at its danger, with faith and expectation ofrelief. This is our duty upon our first being surprised by temptations,and would stop their progress, which is our wisdom.
Heb 3:1-6	<br>Christ is to be considered as the Apostle of our profession, theMessenger sent by God to men, the great Revealer of that faith which weprofess to hold, and of that hope which we profess to have. As Christ,the Messiah, anointed for the office both of Apostle and High Priest.As Jesus, our Saviour, our Healer, the great Physician of souls.Consider him thus. Consider what he is in himself, what he is to us,and what he will be to us hereafter and for ever. Close and seriousthoughts of Christ bring us to know more of him. The Jews had a highopinion of the faithfulness of Moses, yet his faithfulness was but atype of Christ's. Christ was the Master of this house, of his church,his people, as well as their Maker. Moses was a faithful servant;Christ, as the eternal Son of God, is rightful Owner and SovereignRuler of the Church. There must not only be setting out well in theways of Christ, but stedfastness and perseverance therein to the end.Every meditation on his person and his salvation, will suggest morewisdom, new motives to love, confidence, and obedience.
Heb 3:7-13	<br>Days of temptation are often days of provocation. But to provoke God,when he is letting us see that we entirely depend and live upon him, isa provocation indeed. The hardening of the heart is the spring of allother sins. The sins of others, especially of our relations, should bewarnings to us. All sin, especially sin committed by God's professing,privileged people, not only provokes God, but it grieves him. God isloth to destroy any in, or for their sin; he waits long to be graciousto them. But sin, long persisted in, will make God's wrath discoveritself in destroying the impenitent; there is no resting under thewrath of God. "Take heed:" all who would get safe to heaven must lookabout them; if once we allow ourselves to distrust God, we may soondesert him. Let those that think they stand, take heed lest they fall.Since to-morrow is not ours, we must make the best improvement of thisday. And there are none, even the strongest of the flock, who do notneed help of other Christians. Neither are there any so low anddespised, but the care of their standing in the faith, and of theirsafety, belongs to all. Sin has so many ways and colours, that we needmore eyes than ours own. Sin appears fair, but is vile; it appearspleasant, but is destructive; it promises much, but performs nothing.The deceitfulness of sin hardens the soul; one sin allowed makes wayfor another; and every act of sin confirms the habit. Let every onebeware of sin.
Heb 3:14-19	<br>The saints' privilege is, they are made partakers of Christ, that is,of the Spirit, the nature, graces, righteousness, and life of Christ;they are interested in all Christ is, in all he has done, or will do.The same spirit with which Christians set out in the ways of God, theyshould maintain unto the end. Perseverance in faith is the bestevidence of the sincerity of our faith. Hearing the word often is ameans of salvation, yet, if not hearkened to, it will expose more tothe Divine wrath. The happiness of being partakers of Christ and hiscomplete salvation, and the fear of God's wrath and eternal misery,should stir us up to persevere in the life of obedient faith. Let usbeware of trusting to outward privileges or professions, and pray to benumbered with the true believers who enter heaven, when all others failbecause of unbelief. As our obedience follows according to the power ofour faith, so our sins and want of care are according to the prevailingof unbelief in us.
Heb 4:1-10	<br>The privileges we have under the gospel, are greater than any had underthe law of Moses, though the same gospel for substance was preachedunder both Testaments. There have been in all ages many unprofitablehearers; and unbelief is at the root of all unfruitfulness under theword. Faith in the hearer is the life of the word. But it is a painfulconsequence of partial neglect, and of a loose and wavering profession,that they often cause men to seem to come short. Let us then givediligence, that we may have a clear entrance into the kingdom of God.As God finished his work, and then rested from it, so he will causethose who believe, to finish their work, and then to enjoy their rest.It is evident, that there is a more spiritual and excellent sabbathremaining for the people of God, than that of the seventh day, or thatinto which Joshua led the Jews. This rest is, a rest of grace, andcomfort, and holiness, in the gospel state. And a rest in glory, wherethe people of God shall enjoy the end of their faith, and the object ofall their desires. The rest, or sabbatism, which is the subject of theapostle's reasoning, and as to which he concludes that it remains to beenjoyed, is undoubtedly the heavenly rest, which remains to the peopleof God, and is opposed to a state of labour and trouble in this world.It is the rest they shall obtain when the Lord Jesus shall appear fromheaven. But those who do not believe, shall never enter into thisspiritual rest, either of grace here or glory hereafter. God has alwaysdeclared man's rest to be in him, and his love to be the only realhappiness of the soul; and faith in his promises, through his Son, tobe the only way of entering that rest.
Heb 4:11-16	<br>Observe the end proposed: rest spiritual and eternal; the rest of gracehere, and glory hereafter; in Christ on earth, with Christ in heaven.After due and diligent labour, sweet and satisfying rest shall follow;and labour now, will make that rest more pleasant when it comes. Let uslabour, and quicken each other to be diligent in duty. The HolyScriptures are the word of God. When God sets it home by his Spirit, itconvinces powerfully, converts powerfully, and comforts powerfully. Itmakes a soul that has long been proud, to be humble; and a perversespirit, to be meek and obedient. Sinful habits, that are become as itwere natural to the soul, and rooted deeply in it, are separated andcut off by this sword. It will discover to men their thoughts andpurposes, the vileness of many, the bad principles they are moved by,the sinful ends they act to. The word will show the sinner all that isin his heart. Let us hold fast the doctrines of Christian faith in ourheads, its enlivening principles in our hearts, the open profession ofit in our lips, and be subject to it in our lives. Christ executed onepart of his priesthood on earth, in dying for us; the other he executesin heaven, pleading the cause, and presenting the offerings of hispeople. In the sight of Infinite Wisdom, it was needful that theSaviour of men should be one who has the fellow-feeling which no beingbut a fellow-creature could possibly have; and therefore it wasnecessary he should actual experience of all the effects of sin thatcould be separated from its actual guilt. God sent his own Son in thelikeness of sinful flesh, Ro 8:3; but the more holy and pure he was,the more he must have been unwilling in his nature to sin, and musthave had deeper impression of its evil; consequently the more must hebe concerned to deliver his people from its guilt and power. We shouldencourage ourselves by the excellence of our High Priest, to comeboldly to the throne of grace. Mercy and grace are the things we want;mercy to pardon all our sins, and grace to purify our souls. Besidesour daily dependence upon God for present supplies, there are seasonsfor which we should provide in our prayers; times of temptation, eitherby adversity or prosperity, and especially our dying time. We are tocome with reverence and godly fear, yet not as if dragged to the seatof justice, but as kindly invited to the mercy-seat, where gracereigns. We have boldness to enter into the holiest only by the blood ofJesus; he is our Advocate, and has purchased all our souls want or candesire.
Heb 5:1-10	<br>The High Priest must be a man, a partaker of our nature. This showsthat man had sinned. For God would not suffer sinful man to come to himalone. But every one is welcome to God, that comes to him by this HighPriest; and as we value acceptance with God, and pardon, we must applyby faith to this our great High Priest Christ Jesus, who can intercedefor those that are out of the way of truth, duty, and happiness; onewho has tenderness to lead them back from the by-paths of error, sin,and misery. Those only can expect assistance from God, and acceptancewith him, and his presence and blessing on them and their services,that are called of God. This is applied to Christ. In the days of hisflesh, Christ made himself subject to death: he hungered: he was atempted, suffering, dying Jesus. Christ set an example, not only topray, but to be fervent in prayer. How many dry prayers, how few wettedwith tears, do we offer up to God! He was strengthened to support theimmense weight of suffering laid upon him. There is no real deliverancefrom death but to be carried through it. He was raised and exalted, andto him was given the power of saving all sinners to the uttermost, whocome unto God through him. Christ has left us an example that we shouldlearn humble obedience to the will of God, by all our afflictions. Weneed affliction, to teach us submission. His obedience in our natureencourages our attempts to obey, and for us to expect support andcomfort under all the temptations and sufferings to which we areexposed. Being made perfect for this great work, he is become theAuthor of eternal salvation to all that obey him. But are we of thatnumber?
Heb 5:11-14	<br>Dull hearers make the preaching of the gospel difficult, and even thosewho have some faith may be dull hearers, and slow to believe. Much islooked for from those to whom much is given. To be unskilful, denoteswant of experience in the things of the gospel. Christian experience isa spiritual sense, taste, or relish of the goodness, sweetness, andexcellence of the truths of the gospel. And no tongue can express thesatisfaction which the soul receives, from a sense of Divine goodness,grace, and love to it in Christ.
Heb 6:1-8	<br>Every part of the truth and will of God should be set before all whoprofess the gospel, and be urged on their hearts and consciences. Weshould not be always speaking about outward things; these have theirplaces and use, but often take up too much attention and time, whichmight be better employed. The humbled sinner who pleads guilty, andcries for mercy, can have no ground from this passage to bediscouraged, whatever his conscience may accuse him of. Nor does itprove that any one who is made a new creature in Christ, ever becomes afinal apostate from him. The apostle is not speaking of the fallingaway of mere professors, never convinced or influenced by the gospel.Such have nothing to fall away from, but an empty name, or hypocriticalprofession. Neither is he speaking of partial declinings orbackslidings. Nor are such sins meant, as Christians fall into throughthe strength of temptations, or the power of some worldly or fleshlylust. But the falling away here mentioned, is an open and avowedrenouncing of Christ, from enmity of heart against him, his cause, andpeople, by men approving in their minds the deeds of his murderers, andall this after they have received the knowledge of the truth, andtasted some of its comforts. Of these it is said, that it is impossibleto renew them again unto repentance. Not because the blood of Christ isnot sufficient to obtain pardon for this sin; but this sin, in its verynature, is opposite to repentance and every thing that leads to it. Ifthose who through mistaken views of this passage, as well as of theirown case, fear that there is no mercy for them, would attend to theaccount given of the nature of this sin, that it is a total and awilling renouncing of Christ, and his cause, and joining with hisenemies, it would relieve them from wrong fears. We should ourselvesbeware, and caution others, of every approach near to a gulf so awfulas apostacy; yet in doing this we should keep close to the word of God,and be careful not to wound and terrify the weak, or discourage thefallen and penitent. Believers not only taste of the word of God, butthey drink it in. And this fruitful field or garden receives theblessing. But the merely nominal Christian, continuing unfruitful underthe means of grace, or producing nothing but deceit and selfishness,was near the awful state above described; and everlasting misery wasthe end reserved for him. Let us watch with humble caution and prayeras to ourselves.
Heb 6:9,10	<br>There are things that are never separated from salvation; things thatshow the person to be in a state of salvation, and which will end ineternal salvation. And the things that accompany salvation, are betterthings than ever any dissembler or apostate enjoyed. The works of love,done for the glory of Christ, or done to his saints for Christ's sake,from time to time, as God gives occasion, are evident marks of a man'ssalvation; and more sure tokens of saving grace given, than theenlightenings and tastings spoken of before. No love is to be reckonedas love, but working love; and no works are right works, which flow notfrom love to Christ.
Heb 6:11-20	<br>The hope here meant, is a sure looking for good things promised,through those promises, with love, desire, and valuing of them. Hopehas its degrees, as faith also. The promise of blessedness God has madeto believers, is from God's eternal purpose, settled between theeternal Father, Son, and Spirit. These promises of God may safely bedepended upon; for here we have two things which cannot change, thecounsel and the oath of God, in which it is not possible for God tolie; it would be contrary to his nature as well as to his will. And asHe cannot lie; the destruction of the unbeliever, and the salvation ofthe believer, are alike certain. Here observe, those to whom God hasgiven full security of happiness, have a title to the promises byinheritance. The consolations of God are strong enough to support hispeople under their heaviest trials. Here is a refuge for all sinnerswho flee to the mercy of God, through the redemption of Christ,according to the covenant of grace, laying aside all other confidences.We are in this world as a ship at sea, tossed up and down, and indanger of being cast away. We need an anchor to keep us sure andsteady. Gospel hope is our anchor in the storms of this world. It issure and stedfast, or it could not keep us so. The free grace of God,the merits and mediation of Christ, and the powerful influences of hisSpirit, are the grounds of this hope, and so it is a stedfast hope.Christ is the object and ground of the believer's hope. Let ustherefore set our affections on things above, and wait patiently forhis appearance, when we shall certainly appear with him in glory.
Heb 7:1-3	<br>Melchizedec met Abraham when returning from the rescue of Lot. Hisname, "King of Righteousness," doubtless suitable to his character,marked him as a type of the Messiah and his kingdom. The name of hiscity signified "Peace;" and as king of peace he typified Christ, thePrince of Peace, the great Reconciler of God and man. Nothing isrecorded as to the beginning or end of his life; thus he typicallyresembled the Son of God, whose existence is from everlasting toeverlasting, who had no one that was before him, and will have no onecome after him, in his priesthood. Every part of Scripture honours thegreat King of Righteousness and Peace, our glorious High Priest andSaviour; and the more we examine it, the more we shall be convinced,that the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy.
Heb 7:4-10	<br>That High Priest who should afterward appear, of whom Melchizedec was atype, must be much superior to the Levitical priests. Observe Abraham'sgreat dignity and happiness; that he had the promises. That man is richand happy indeed, who has the promises, both of the life that now is,and of that which is to come. This honour have all those who receivethe Lord Jesus. Let us go forth in our spiritual conflicts, trusting inhis word and strength, ascribing our victories to his grace, anddesiring to be met and blessed by him in all our ways.
Heb 7:11-25	<br>The priesthood and law by which perfection could not come, are doneaway; a Priest is risen, and a dispensation now set up, by which truebelievers may be made perfect. That there is such a change is plain.The law which made the Levitical priesthood, showed that the priestswere frail, dying creatures, not able to save their own lives, muchless could they save the souls of those who came to them. But the HighPriest of our profession holds his office by the power of endless lifein himself; not only to keep himself alive, but to give spiritual andeternal life to all who rely upon his sacrifice and intercession. Thebetter covenant, of which Jesus was the Surety, is not here contrastedwith the covenant of works, by which every transgressor is shut upunder the curse. It is distinguished from the Sinai covenant withIsrael, and the legal dispensation under which the church so longremained. The better covenant brought the church and every believerinto clearer light, more perfect liberty, and more abundant privileges.In the order of Aaron there was a multitude of priests, of high priestsone after another; but in the priesthood of Christ there is only oneand the same. This is the believer's safety and happiness, that thiseverlasting High Priest is able to save to the uttermost, in all times,in all cases. Surely then it becomes us to desire a spirituality andholiness, as much beyond those of the Old Testament believers, as ouradvantages exceed theirs.
Heb 7:26-28	<br>Observe the description of the personal holiness of Christ. He is freefrom all habits or principles of sin, not having the least dispositionto it in his nature. No sin dwells in him, not the least sinfulinclination, though such dwells in the best of Christians. He isharmless, free from all actual transgression; he did no violence, norwas there any deceit in his mouth. He is undefiled. It is hard to keepourselves pure, so as not to partake the guilt of other men's sins. Butnone need be dismayed who come to God in the name of his beloved Son.Let them be assured that he will deliver them in the time of trial andsuffering, in the time of prosperity, in the hour of death, and in theday of judgment.
Heb 8:1-6	<br>The substance, or summary, of what had been declared was, thatChristians had such a High Priest as they needed. He took upon himselfhuman nature, appeared on earth, and there gave himself as a sacrificeto God for the sins of his people. We must not dare to approach God, orto present any thing to him, but in and through Christ, depending uponhis merits and mediation; for we are accepted only in the Beloved. Inall obedience and worship, we should keep close to God's word, which isthe only and perfect standard. Christ is the substance and end of thelaw of righteousness. But the covenant here referred to, was that madewith Israel as a nation, securing temporal benefits to them. Thepromises of all spiritual blessings, and of eternal life, revealed inthe gospel, and made sure through Christ, are of infinitely greatervalue. Let us bless God that we have a High Priest that suits ourhelpless condition.
Heb 8:7-13	<br>The superior excellence of the priesthood of Christ, above that ofAaron, is shown from that covenant of grace, of which Christ wasMediator. The law not only made all subject to it, liable to becondemned for the guilt of sin, but also was unable to remove thatguilt, and clear the conscience from the sense and terror of it.Whereas, by the blood of Christ, a full remission of sins was provided,so that God would remember them no more. God once wrote his laws to hispeople, now he will write his laws in them; he will give themunderstanding to know and to believe his laws; he will give themmemories to retain them; he will give them hearts to love them, courageto profess them, and power to put them in practice. This is thefoundation of the covenant; and when this is laid, duty will be donewisely, sincerely, readily, easily, resolutely, constantly, and withcomfort. A plentiful outpouring of the Spirit of God will make theministration of the gospel so effectual, that there shall be a mightyincrease and spreading of Christian knowledge in persons of all sorts.Oh that this promise might be fulfilled in our days, that the hand ofGod may be with his ministers so that great numbers may believe, and beturned to the Lord! The pardon of sin will always be found to accompanythe true knowledge of God. Notice the freeness of this pardon; itsfulness; its fixedness. This pardoning mercy is connected with allother spiritual mercies: unpardoned sin hinders mercy, and pulls downjudgments; but the pardon of sin prevents judgment, and opens a widedoor to all spiritual blessings. Let us search whether we are taught bythe Holy Spirit to know Christ, so as uprightly to love, fear, trust,and obey him. All worldly vanities, outward privileges, or mere notionsof religion, will soon vanish away, and leave those who trust in themmiserable for ever.
Heb 9:1-5	<br>The apostle shows to the Hebrews the typical reference of theirceremonies to Christ. The tabernacle was a movable temple, shadowingforth the unsettled state of the church upon earth, and the humannature of the Lord Jesus Christ, in whom the fulness of the Godheaddwelt bodily. The typical meaning of these things has been shown informer remarks, and the ordinances and articles of the Mosaic covenantpoint out Christ as our Light, and as the Bread of life to our souls;and remind us of his Divine Person, his holy priesthood, perfectrighteousness, and all-prevailing intercession. Thus was the Lord JesusChrist, all and in all, from the beginning. And as interpreted by thegospel, these things are a glorious representation of the wisdom ofGod, and confirm faith in Him who was prefigured by them.
Heb 9:6-10	<br>The apostle goes on to speak of the Old Testament services. Christ,having undertaken to be our High Priest, could not enter into heaventill he had shed his blood for us; and none of us can enter, eitherinto God's gracious presence here, or his glorious presence hereafter,but by the blood of Jesus. Sins are errors, great errors, both injudgment and practice; and who can understand all his errors? Theyleave guilt upon the conscience, not to be washed away but by the bloodof Christ. We must plead this blood on earth, while he is pleading itfor us in heaven. A few believers, under the Divine teaching, sawsomething of the way of access to God, of communion with him, and ofadmission into heaven through the promised Redeemer, but the Israelitesin general looked no further than the outward forms. These could nottake away the defilement or dominion of sin. They could neitherdischarge the debts, nor resolve the doubts, of him who did theservice. Gospel times are, and should be, times of reformation, ofclearer light as to all things needful to be known, and of greaterlove, causing us to bear ill-will to none, but good-will to all. Wehave greater freedom, both of spirit and speech, in the gospel, andgreater obligations to a more holy living.
Heb 9:11-14	<br>All good things past, present, and to come, were and are founded uponthe priestly office of Christ, and come to us from thence. Our HighPriest entered into heaven once for all, and has obtained eternalredemption. The Holy Ghost further signified and showed that the OldTestament sacrifices only freed the outward man from ceremonialuncleanness, and fitted him for some outward privileges. What gave suchpower to the blood of Christ? It was Christ's offering himself withoutany sinful stain in his nature or life. This cleanses the most guiltyconscience from dead, or deadly, works to serve the living God; fromsinful works, such as pollute the soul, as dead bodies did the personsof the Jews who touched them; while the grace that seals pardon,new-creates the polluted soul. Nothing more destroys the faith of thegospel, than by any means to weaken the direct power of the blood ofChrist. The depth of the mystery of the sacrifice of Christ, we cannotdive into, the height we cannot comprehend. We cannot search out thegreatness of it, or the wisdom, the love, the grace that is in it. Butin considering the sacrifice of Christ, faith finds life, food, andrefreshment.
Heb 9:15-22	<br>The solemn transactions between God and man, are sometimes called acovenant, here a testament, which is a willing deed of a person,bestowing legacies on such persons as are described, and it only takeseffect upon his death. Thus Christ died, not only to obtain theblessings of salvation for us, but to give power to the disposal ofthem. All, by sin, were become guilty before God, had forfeited everything that is good; but God, willing to show the greatness of hismercy, proclaimed a covenant of grace. Nothing could be clean to asinner, not even his religious duties; except as his guilt was doneaway by the death of a sacrifice, of value sufficient for that end, andunless he continually depended upon it. May we ascribe all real goodworks to the same all-procuring cause, and offer our spiritualsacrifices as sprinkled with Christ's blood, and so purified from theirdefilement.
Heb 9:23-28	<br>It is evident that the sacrifices of Christ are infinitely better thanthose of the law, which could neither procure pardon for sin, norimpart power against it. Sin would still have been upon us, and havehad dominion over us; but Jesus Christ, by one sacrifice, has destroyedthe works of the devil, that believers may be made righteous, holy, andhappy. As no wisdom, learning, virtue, wealth, or power, can keep oneof the human race from death, so nothing can deliver a sinner frombeing condemned at the day of judgment, except the atoning sacrifice ofChrist; nor will one be saved from eternal punishment who despises orneglects this great salvation. The believer knows that his Redeemerliveth, and that he shall see him. Here is the faith and patience ofthe church, of all sincere believers. Hence is their continual prayeras the fruit and expression of their faith, Even so come, Lord Jesus.
Heb 10:1-10	<br>The apostle having shown that the tabernacle, and ordinances of thecovenant of Sinai, were only emblems and types of the gospel, concludesthat the sacrifices the high priests offered continually, could notmake the worshippers perfect, with respect to pardon, and the purifyingof their consciences. But when "God manifested in the flesh," becamethe sacrifice, and his death upon the accursed tree the ransom, thenthe Sufferer being of infinite worth, his free-will sufferings were ofinfinite value. The atoning sacrifice must be one capable ofconsenting, and must of his own will place himself in the sinner'sstead: Christ did so. The fountain of all that Christ has done for hispeople, is the sovereign will and grace of God. The righteousnessbrought in, and the sacrifice once offered by Christ, are of eternalpower, and his salvation shall never be done away. They are of power tomake all the comers thereunto perfect; they derive from the atoningblood, strength and motives for obedience, and inward comfort.
Heb 10:11-18	<br>Under the new covenant, or gospel dispensation, full and final pardonis to be had. This makes a vast difference between the new covenant andthe old one. Under the old, sacrifices must be often repeated, andafter all, only pardon as to this world was to be obtained by them.Under the new, one Sacrifice is enough to procure for all nations andages, spiritual pardon, or being freed from punishment in the world tocome. Well might this be called a new covenant. Let none suppose thathuman inventions can avail those who put them in the place of thesacrifice of the Son of God. What then remains, but that we seek aninterest in this Sacrifice by faith; and the seal of it to our souls,by the sanctification of the Spirit unto obedience? So that by the lawbeing written in our hearts, we may know that we are justified, andthat God will no more remember our sins.
Heb 10:19-25	<br>The apostle having closed the first part of the epistle, the doctrineis applied to practical purposes. As believers had an open way to thepresence of God, it became them to use this privilege. The way andmeans by which Christians enjoy such privileges, is by the blood ofJesus, by the merit of that blood which he offered up as an atoningsacrifice. The agreement of infinite holiness with pardoning mercy, wasnot clearly understood till the human nature of Christ, the Son of God,was wounded and bruised for our sins. Our way to heaven is by acrucified Saviour; his death is to us the way of life, and to those whobelieve this, he will be precious. They must draw near to God; it wouldbe contempt of Christ, still to keep at a distance. Their bodies wereto be washed with pure water, alluding to the cleansings directed underthe law: thus the use of water in baptism, was to remind Christiansthat their conduct should be pure and holy. While they derived comfortand grace from their reconciled Father to their own souls, they wouldadorn the doctrine of God their Saviour in all things. Believers are toconsider how they can be of service to each other, especially stirringup each other to the more vigorous and abundant exercise of love, andthe practice of good works. The communion of saints is a great help andprivilege, and a means of stedfastness and perseverance. We shouldobserve the coming of times of trial, and be thereby quickened togreater diligence. There is a trying day coming on all men, the day ofour death.
Heb 10:26-31	<br>The exhortations against apostacy and to perseverance, are urged bymany strong reasons. The sin here mentioned is a total and finalfalling away, when men, with a full and fixed will and resolution,despise and reject Christ, the only Saviour; despise and resist theSpirit, the only Sanctifier; and despise and renounce the gospel, theonly way of salvation, and the words of eternal life. Of thisdestruction God gives some notorious sinners, while on earth, a fearfulforeboding in their consciences, with despair of being able to endureor to escape it. But what punishment can be sorer than to die withoutmercy? We answer, to die by mercy, by the mercy and grace which theyhave despised. How dreadful is the case, when not only the justice ofGod, but his abused grace and mercy call for vengeance! All this doesnot in the least mean that any souls who sorrow for sin will be shutout from mercy, or that any will be refused the benefit of Christ'ssacrifice, who are willing to accept these blessings. Him that comethunto Christ, he will in no wise cast out.
Heb 10:32-39	<br>Many and various afflictions united against the early Christians, andthey had a great conflict. The Christian spirit is not a selfishspirit; it puts us upon pitying others, visiting them, helping them,and pleading for them. All things here are but shadows. The happinessof the saints in heaven will last for ever; enemies can never take itaway as earthly goods. This will make rich amends for all we may loseand suffer here. The greatest part of the saints' happiness, as yet, isin promise. It is a trial of the patience of Christians, to be contentto live after their work is done, and to stay for their reward tillGod's time to give it is come. He will soon come to them at death, toend all their sufferings, and to give them a crown of life. TheChristian's present conflict may be sharp, but will be soon over. Godnever is pleased with the formal profession and outward duties andservices of such as do not persevere; but he beholds them with greatdispleasure. And those who have been kept faithful in great trails forthe time past, have reason to hope for the same grace to help themstill to live by faith, till they receive the end of their faith andpatience, even the salvation of their souls. Living by faith, and dyingin faith, our souls are safe for ever.
Heb 11:1-3	<br>Faith always has been the mark of God's servants, from the beginning ofthe world. Where the principle is planted by the regenerating Spirit ofGod, it will cause the truth to be received, concerning justificationby the sufferings and merits of Christ. And the same things that arethe object of our hope, are the object of our faith. It is a firmpersuasion and expectation, that God will perform all he has promisedto us in Christ. This persuasion gives the soul to enjoy those thingsnow; it gives them a subsistence or reality in the soul, by thefirst-fruits and foretastes of them. Faith proves to the mind, thereality of things that cannot be seen by the bodily eye. It is a fullapproval of all God has revealed, as holy, just, and good. This view offaith is explained by many examples of persons in former times, whoobtained a good report, or an honourable character in the word of God.Faith was the principle of their holy obedience, remarkable services,and patient sufferings. The Bible gives the most true and exact accountof the origin of all things, and we are to believe it, and not to wrestthe Scripture account of the creation, because it does not suit withthe differing fancies of men. All that we see of the works of creation,were brought into being by the command of God.
Heb 11:4-7	<br>Here follow some illustrious examples of faith from the Old Testament.Abel brought a sacrifice of atonement from the firstlings of the flock,acknowledging himself a sinner who deserved to die, and only hoping formercy through the great Sacrifice. Cain's proud rage and enmity againstthe accepted worshipper of God, led to the awful effects the sameprinciples have produced in every age; the cruel persecution, and evenmurder of believers. By faith Abel, being dead, yet speaketh; he leftan instructive and speaking example. Enoch was translated, or removed,that he should not see death; God took him into heaven, as Christ willdo the saints who shall be alive at his second coming. We cannot cometo God, unless we believe that he is what he has revealed himself to bein the Scripture. Those who would find God, must seek him with alltheir heart. Noah's faith influenced his practice; it moved him toprepare an ark. His faith condemned the unbelief of others; and hisobedience condemned their contempt and rebellion. Good examples eitherconvert sinners or condemn them. This shows how believers, being warnedof God to flee from the wrath to come, are moved with fear, take refugein Christ, and become heirs of the righteousness of faith.
Heb 11:8-19	<br>We are often called to leave worldly connexions, interests, andcomforts. If heirs of Abraham's faith, we shall obey and go forth,though not knowing what may befall us; and we shall be found in the wayof duty, looking for the performance of God's promises. The trial ofAbraham's faith was, that he simply and fully obeyed the call of God.Sarah received the promise as the promise of God; being convinced ofthat, she truly judged that he both could and would perform it. Many,who have a part in the promises, do not soon receive the thingspromised. Faith can lay hold of blessings at a great distance; can makethem present; can love them and rejoice in them, though strangers; assaints, whose home is heaven; as pilgrims, travelling toward theirhome. By faith, they overcome the terrors of death, and bid a cheerfulfarewell to this world, and to all the comforts and crosses of it. Andthose once truly and savingly called out of a sinful state, have nomind to return into it. All true believers desire the heavenlyinheritance; and the stronger faith is, the more fervent those desireswill be. Notwithstanding their meanness by nature, their vileness bysin, and the poverty of their outward condition, God is not ashamed tobe called the God of all true believers; such is his mercy, such is hislove to them. Let them never be ashamed of being called his people, norof any of those who are truly so, how much soever despised in theworld. Above all, let them take care that they are not a shame andreproach to their God. The greatest trial and act of faith upon recordis, Abraham's offering up Isaac, Ge 22:2. There, every word shows atrial. It is our duty to reason down our doubts and fears, by looking,as Abraham did, to the Almighty power of God. The best way to enjoy ourcomforts is, to give them up to God; he will then again give them asshall be the best for us. Let us look how far our faith has caused thelike obedience, when we have been called to lesser acts of self-denial,or to make smaller sacrifices to our duty. Have we given up what wascalled for, fully believing that the Lord would make up all our losses,and even bless us by the most afflicting dispensations?
Heb 11:20-31	<br>Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau, concerning things to come. Things presentare not the best things; no man knoweth love or hatred by having themor wanting them. Jacob lived by faith, and he died by faith, and infaith. Though the grace of faith is of use always through our wholelives, it is especially so when we come to die. Faith has a great workto do at last, to help the believer to die to the Lord, so as to honourhim, by patience, hope, and joy. Joseph was tried by temptations tosin, by persecution for keeping his integrity; and he was tried byhonours and power in the court of Pharaoh, yet his faith carried himthrough. It is a great mercy to be free from wicked laws and edicts;but when we are not so, we must use all lawful means for our security.In this faith of Moses' parents there was a mixture of unbelief, butGod was pleased to overlook it. Faith gives strength against thesinful, slavish fear of men; it sets God before the soul, shows thevanity of the creature, and that all must give way to the will andpower of God. The pleasures of sin are, and will be, but short; theymust end either in speedy repentance or in speedy ruin. The pleasuresof this world are for the most part the pleasures of sin; they arealways so when we cannot enjoy them without deserting God and hispeople. Suffering is to be chosen rather than sin; there being moreevil in the least sin, than there can be in the greatest suffering.God's people are, and always have been, a reproached people. Christaccounts himself reproached in their reproaches; and thus they becomegreater riches than the treasures of the richest empire in the world.Moses made his choice when ripe for judgment and enjoyment, able toknow what he did, and why he did it. It is needful for persons to beseriously religious; to despise the world, when most capable ofrelishing and enjoying it. Believers may and ought to have respect tothe recompence of reward. By faith we may be fully sure of God'sprovidence, and of his gracious and powerful presence with us. Such asight of God will enable believers to keep on to the end, whatever theymay meet in the way. It is not owing to our own righteousness, or bestperformances, that we are saved from the wrath of God; but to the bloodof Christ, and his imputed righteousness. True faith makes sin bitterto the soul, even while it receives the pardon and atonement. All ourspiritual privileges on earth, should quicken us in our way to heaven.The Lord will make even Babylon fall before the faith of his people,and when he has some great thing to do for them, he raises up great andstrong faith in them. A true believer is desirous, not only to be incovenant with God, but in communion with the people of God; and iswilling to fare as they fare. By her works Rahab declared herself to bejust. That she was not justified by her works appears plainly; becausethe work she did was faulty in the manner, and not perfectly good,therefore it could not be answerable to the perfect justice orrighteousness of God.
Heb 11:32-38	<br>After all our searches into the Scriptures, there is more to be learnedfrom them. We should be pleased to think, how great the number ofbelievers was under the Old Testament, and how strong their faith,though the objects of it were not then so fully made known as now. Andwe should lament that now, in gospel times, when the rule of faith ismore clear and perfect, the number of believers should be so small, andtheir faith so weak. It is the excellence of the grace of faith, that,while it helps men to do great things, like Gideon, it keeps from highand great thoughts of themselves. Faith, like Barak's, has recourseunto God in all dangers and difficulties, and then makes gratefulreturns to God for all mercies and deliverances. By faith, the servantsof God shall overcome even the roaring lion that goeth about seekingwhom he may devour. The believer's faith endures to the end, and, indying, gives him victory over death and all his deadly enemies, likeSamson. The grace of God often fixes upon very undeserving andill-deserving persons, to do great things for them and by them. But thegrace of faith, wherever it is, will put men upon acknowledging God inall their ways, as Jephthah. It will make men bold and courageous in agood cause. Few ever met with greater trials, few ever showed morelively faith, than David, and he has left a testimony as to the trialsand acts of faith, in the book of Psalms, which has been, and ever willbe, of great value to the people of God. Those are likely to grow up tobe distinguished for faith, who begin betimes, like Samuel, to exerciseit. And faith will enable a man to serve God and his generation, inwhatever way he may be employed. The interests and powers of kings andkingdoms, are often opposed to God and his people; but God can easilysubdue all that set themselves against him. It is a greater honour andhappiness to work righteousness than to work miracles. By faith we havecomfort of the promises; and by faith we are prepared to wait for thepromises, and in due time to receive them. And though we do not hope tohave our dead relatives or friends restored to life in this world, yetfaith will support under the loss of them, and direct to the hope of abetter resurrection. Shall we be most amazed at the wickedness of humannature, that it is capable of such awful cruelties to fellow-creatures,or at the excellence of Divine grace, that is able to bear up thefaithful under such cruelties, and to carry them safely through all?What a difference between God's judgement of a saint, and man'sjudgment! The world is not worthy of those scorned, persecuted saints,whom their persecutors reckon unworthy to live. They are not worthy oftheir company, example, counsel, or other benefits. For they know notwhat a saint is, nor the worth of a saint, nor how to use him; theyhate, and drive such away, as they do the offer of Christ and hisgrace. (Heb 11:39)
Heb 11:39,40	<br>The world considers that the righteous are not worthy to live in theworld, and God declares the world is not worthy of them. Though therighteous and the worldlings widely differ in their judgment, theyagree in this, it is not fit that good men should have their rest inthis world. Therefore God receives them out of it. The apostle tellsthe Hebrews, that God had provided some better things for them,therefore they might be sure that he expected as good things from them.As our advantages, with the better things God has provided for us, areso much beyond theirs, so should our obedience of faith, patience ofhope, and labour of love, be greater. And unless we get true faith asthese believers had, they will rise up to condemn us at the last day.Let us then pray continually for the increase of our faith, that we mayfollow these bright examples, and be, with them, at length made perfectin holiness and happiness, and shine like the sun in the kingdom of ourFather for evermore.
Heb 12:1-11	<br>The persevering obedience of faith in Christ, was the race set beforethe Hebrews, wherein they must either win the crown of glory, or haveeverlasting misery for their portion; and it is set before us. By thesin that does so easily beset us, understand that sin to which we aremost prone, or to which we are most exposed, from habit, age, orcircumstances. This is a most important exhortation; for while a man'sdarling sin, be it what it will, remains unsubdued, it will hinder himfrom running the Christian race, as it takes from him every motive forrunning, and gives power to every discouragement. When weary and faintin their minds, let them recollect that the holy Jesus suffered, tosave them from eternal misery. By stedfastly looking to Jesus, theirthoughts would strengthen holy affections, and keep under their carnaldesires. Let us then frequently consider him. What are our littletrials to his agonies, or even to our deserts? What are they to thesufferings of many others? There is a proneness in believers to growweary, and to faint under trials and afflictions; this is from theimperfection of grace and the remains of corruption. Christians shouldnot faint under their trials. Though their enemies and persecutors maybe instruments to inflict sufferings, yet they are Divinechastisements; their heavenly Father has his hand in all, and his wiseend to answer by all. They must not make light of afflictions, and bewithout feeling under them, for they are the hand and rod of God, andare his rebukes for sin. They must not despond and sink under trials,nor fret and repine, but bear up with faith and patience. God may letothers alone in their sins, but he will correct sin in his ownchildren. In this he acts as becomes a father. Our earthly parentssometimes may chasten us, to gratify their passion, rather than toreform our manners. But the Father of our souls never willingly grievesnor afflicts his children. It is always for our profit. Our whole lifehere is a state of childhood, and imperfect as to spiritual things;therefore we must submit to the discipline of such a state. When wecome to a perfect state, we shall be fully reconciled to all God'schastisement of us now. God's correction is not condemnation; thechastening may be borne with patience, and greatly promote holiness.Let us then learn to consider the afflictions brought on us by themalice of men, as corrections sent by our wise and gracious Father, forour spiritual good.
Heb 12:12-17	<br>A burden of affliction is apt to make the Christian's hands hang down,and his knees grow feeble, to dispirit him and discourage him; butagainst this he must strive, that he may better run his spiritual raceand course. Faith and patience enable believers to follow peace andholiness, as a man follows his calling constantly, diligently, and withpleasure. Peace with men, of all sects and parties, will be favourableto our pursuit of holiness. But peace and holiness go together; therecan be not right peace without holiness. Where persons fail of havingthe true grace of God, corruption will prevail and break forth; bewarelest any unmortified lust in the heart, which seems to be dead, shouldspring up, to trouble and disturb the whole body. Falling away fromChrist is the fruit of preferring the delights of the flesh, to theblessing of God, and the heavenly inheritance, as Esau did. But sinnerswill not always have such mean thoughts of the Divine blessing andinheritance as they now have. It agrees with the profane man'sdisposition, to desire the blessing, yet to despise the means wherebythe blessing is to be gained. But God will neither sever the means fromthe blessing, nor join the blessing with the satisfying of man's lusts.God's mercy and blessing were never sought carefully and not obtained.
Heb 12:18-29	<br>Mount Sinai, on which the Jewish church state was formed, was a mountsuch as might be touched, though forbidden to be so, a place that couldbe felt; so the Mosaic dispensation was much in outward and earthlythings. The gospel state is kind and condescending, suited to our weakframe. Under the gospel all may come with boldness to God's presence.But the most holy must despair, if judged by the holy law given fromSinai, without a Saviour. The gospel church is called Mount Zion; therebelievers have clearer views of heaven, and more heavenly tempers ofsoul. All the children of God are heirs, and every one has theprivileges of the first-born. Let a soul be supposed to join thatglorious assembly and church above, that is yet unacquainted with God,still carnally-minded, loving this present world and state of things,looking back to it with a lingering eye, full of pride and guile,filled with lusts; such a soul would seem to have mistaken its way,place, state, and company. It would be uneasy to itself and all aboutit. Christ is the Mediator of this new covenant, between God and man,to bring them together in this covenant; to keep them together; toplead with God for us, and to plead with us for God; and at length tobring God and his people together in heaven. This covenant is made firmby the blood of Christ sprinkled upon our consciences, as the blood ofthe sacrifice was sprinkled upon the altar and the victim. This bloodof Christ speaks in behalf of sinners; it pleads not for vengeance, butfor mercy. See then that you refuse not his gracious call and offeredsalvation. See that you do not refuse Him who speaketh from heaven,with infinite tenderness and love; for how can those escape, who turnfrom God in unbelief or apostacy, while he so graciously beseeches themto be reconciled, and to receive his everlasting favour! God's dealingwith men under the gospel, in a way of grace, assures us, that he willdeal with the despisers of the gospel, in a way of judgment. We cannotworship God acceptably, unless we worship him with reverence and godlyfear. Only the grace of God enables us to worship God aright. God isthe same just and righteous God under the gospel as under the law. Theinheritance of believers is secured to them; and all things pertainingto salvation are freely given in answer to prayer. Let us seek forgrace, that we may serve God with reverence and godly fear.
Heb 13:1-6	<br>The design of Christ in giving himself for us, is, that he may purchaseto himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works; and true religionis the strongest bond of friendship. Here are earnest exhortations toseveral Christian duties, especially contentment. The sin opposed tothis grace and duty is covetousness, an over-eager desire for thewealth of this world, with envy of those who have more than ourselves.Having treasures in heaven, we may be content with mean things here.Those who cannot be so, would not be content though God raised theircondition. Adam was in paradise, yet not contented; some angels inheaven were not contented; but the apostle Paul, though abased andempty, had learned in every state, in any state, to be content.Christians have reason to be contented with their present lot. Thispromise contains the sum and substance of all the promises; "I willnever, no, never leave thee, no, never forsake thee." In the originalthere are no less than five negatives put together, to confirm thepromise: the true believer shall have the gracious presence of God withhim, in life, at death, and for ever. Men can do nothing against God,and God can make all that men do against his people, to turn to theirgood.
Heb 13:7-15	<br>The instructions and examples of ministers, who honourably andcomfortably closed their testimony, should be particularly rememberedby survivors. And though their ministers were some dead, others dying,yet the great Head and High Priest of the church, the Bishop of theirsouls, ever lives, and is ever the same. Christ is the same in the OldTestament day. as in the gospel day, and will be so to his people forever, equally merciful, powerful, and all-sufficient. Still he fillsthe hungry, encourages the trembling, and welcomes repenting sinners:still he rejects the proud and self-righteous, abhors mere profession,and teaches all whom he saves, to love righteousness, and to hateiniquity. Believers should seek to have their hearts established insimple dependence on free grace, by the Holy Spirit, which wouldcomfort their hearts, and render them proof against delusion. Christ isboth our Altar and our Sacrifice; he sanctifies the gift. The Lord'ssupper is the feast of the gospel passover. Having showed that keepingto the Levitical law would, according to its own rules, keep men fromthe Christian altar, the apostle adds, Let us go forth therefore untohim without the camp; go forth from the ceremonial law, from sin, fromthe world, and from ourselves. Living by faith in Christ, set apart toGod through his blood, let us willingly separate from this evil world.Sin, sinners, nor death, will not suffer us to continue long here;therefore let us go forth now by faith and seek in Christ the rest andpeace which this world cannot afford us. Let us bring our sacrifices tothis altar, and to this our High Priest, and offer them up by him. Thesacrifice of praise to God, we should offer always. In this are worshipand prayer, as well as thanksgiving.
Heb 13:16-21	<br>We must, according to our power, give to the necessities of the soulsand bodies of men: God will accept these offerings with pleasure, andwill accept and bless the offerers through Christ. The apostle thenstates what is their duty to living ministers; to obey and submit tothem, so far as is agreeable to the mind and will of God, made known inhis word. Christians must not think themselves too wise, too good, ortoo great, to learn. The people must search the Scriptures, and so faras the ministers teach according to that rule, they ought to receivetheir instructions as the word of God, which works in those thatbelieve. It is the interest of hearers, that the account theirministers give of them may be with joy, and not with grief. Faithfulministers deliver their own souls, but the ruin of a fruitless andfaithless people will be upon their own heads. The more earnestly thepeople pray for their ministers, the more benefit they may expect fromtheir ministry. A good conscience has respect to all God's commands,and all our duty. Those who have this good conscience, yet need theprayers of others. When ministers come to a people who pray for them,they come with greater satisfaction to themselves, and success to thepeople. We should seek all our mercies by prayer. God is the God ofpeace, fully reconciled to believers; who has made a way for peace andreconciliation between himself and sinners, and who loves peace onearth, especially in his churches. He is the Author of spiritual peacein the hearts and consciences of his people. How firm a covenant isthat which has its foundation in the blood of the Son of God! Theperfecting of the saints in every good work, is the great thing desiredby them, and for them; and that they may at length be fitted for theemployment and happiness of heaven. There is no good thing wrought inus, but it is the work of God. And no good thing is wrought in us byGod, but through Christ, for his sake and by his Spirit.
Heb 13:22-25	<br>So bad are men, and even believers, through the remainders of theircorruption, that when the most important, comfortable doctrine isdelivered to them for their own good, and that with the most convincingevidence, there is need of earnest entreaty and exhortation that theywould bear it, and not fall out with it, neglect it, or reject it. Itis good to have the law of holy love and kindness written in the heartsof Christians, one towards another. Religion teaches men true civilityand good breeding. It is not ill-tempered or uncourteous. Let thefavour of God be toward you, and his grace continually working in you,and with you, bringing forth the fruits of holiness, as thefirst-fruits of glory.
Jam 1:1-11	<br>Christianity teaches men to be joyful under troubles: such exercisesare sent from God's love; and trials in the way of duty will brightenour graces now, and our crown at last. Let us take care, in times oftrial, that patience, and not passion, is set to work in us: whateveris said or done, let patience have the saying and doing of it. When thework of patience is complete, it will furnish all that is necessary forour Christian race and warfare. We should not pray so much for theremoval of affliction, as for wisdom to make a right use of it. And whodoes not want wisdom to guide him under trials, both in regulating hisown spirit, and in managing his affairs? Here is something in answer toevery discouraging turn of the mind, when we go to God under a sense ofour own weakness and folly. If, after all, any should say, This may bethe case with some, but I fear I shall not succeed, the promise is, Toany that asketh, it shall be given. A mind that has single andprevailing regard to its spiritual and eternal interest, and that keepssteady in its purposes for God, will grow wise by afflictions, willcontinue fervent in devotion, and rise above trials and oppositions.When our faith and spirits rise and fall with second causes, there willbe unsteadiness in our words and actions. This may not always exposemen to contempt in the world, but such ways cannot please God. Nocondition of life is such as to hinder rejoicing in God. Those of lowdegree may rejoice, if they are exalted to be rich in faith and heirsof the kingdom of God; and the rich may rejoice in humblingprovidences, that lead to a humble and lowly disposition of mind.Worldly wealth is a withering thing. Then, let him that is rich rejoicein the grace of God, which makes and keeps him humble; and in thetrials and exercises which teach him to seek happiness in and from God,not from perishing enjoyments.
Jam 1:12-18	<br>It is not every man who suffers, that is blessed; but he who withpatience and constancy goes through all difficulties in the way ofduty. Afflictions cannot make us miserable, if it be not our own fault.The tried Christian shall be a crowned one. The crown of life ispromised to all who have the love of God reigning in their hearts.Every soul that truly loves God, shall have its trials in this worldfully recompensed in that world above, where love is made perfect. Thecommands of God, and the dealings of his providence, try men's hearts,and show the dispositions which prevail in them. But nothing sinful inthe heart or conduct can be ascribed to God. He is not the author ofthe dross, though his fiery trial exposes it. Those who lay the blameof sin, either upon their constitution, or upon their condition in theworld, or pretend they cannot keep from sinning, wrong God as if hewere the author of sin. Afflictions, as sent by God, are designed todraw out our graces, but not our corruptions. The origin of evil andtemptation is in our own hearts. Stop the beginnings of sin, or all theevils that follow must be wholly charged upon us. God has no pleasurein the death of men, as he has no hand in their sin; but both sin andmisery are owing to themselves. As the sun is the same in nature andinfluences, though the earth and clouds, often coming between, make itseem to us to vary, so God is unchangeable, and our changes and shadowsare not from any changes or alterations in him. What the sun is innature, God is in grace, providence, and glory; and infinitely more. Asevery good gift is from God, so particularly our being born again, andall its holy, happy consequences come from him. A true Christianbecomes as different a person from what he was before the renewinginfluences of Divine grace, as if he were formed over again. We shoulddevote all our faculties to God's service, that we may be a kind offirst-fruits of his creatures.
Jam 1:19-21	<br>Instead of blaming God under our trials, let us open our ears andhearts to learn what he teaches by them. And if men would govern theirtongues, they must govern their passions. The worst thing we can bringto any dispute, is anger. Here is an exhortation to lay apart, and tocast off as a filthy garment, all sinful practices. This must reach tosins of thought and affection, as well as of speech and practice; toevery thing corrupt and sinful. We must yield ourselves to the word ofGod, with humble and teachable minds. Being willing to hear of ourfaults, taking it not only patiently, but thankfully. It is the designof the word of God to make us wise to salvation; and those who proposeany mean or low ends in attending upon it, dishonour the gospel, anddisappoint their own souls.
Jam 1:22-25	<br>If we heard a sermon every day of the week, and an angel from heavenwere the preacher, yet, if we rested in hearing only, it would neverbring us to heaven. Mere hearers are self-deceivers; and self-deceitwill be found the worst deceit at last. If we flatter ourselves, it isour own fault; the truth, as it is in Jesus, flatters no man. Let theword of truth be carefully attended to, and it will set before us thecorruption of our nature, the disorders of our hearts and lives; and itwill tell us plainly what we are. Our sins are the spots the lawdiscovers: Christ's blood is the laver the gospel shows. But in vain dowe hear God's word, and look into the gospel glass, if we go away, andforget our spots, instead of washing them off; and forget our remedy,instead of applying to it. This is the case with those who do not hearthe word as they ought. In hearing the word, we look into it forcounsel and direction, and when we study it, it turns to our spirituallife. Those who keep in the law and word of God, are, and shall be,blessed in all their ways. His gracious recompence hereafter, would beconnected with his present peace and comfort. Every part of Divinerevelation has its use, in bringing the sinner to Christ for salvation,and in directing and encouraging him to walk at liberty, by the Spiritof adoption, according to the holy commands of God. And mark thedistinctness, it is not for his deeds, that any man is blessed, but inhis deed. It is not talking, but walking, that will bring us to heaven.Christ will become more precious to the believer's soul, which by hisgrace will become more fitted for the inheritance of the saints inlight.
Jam 1:26,27	<br>When men take more pains to seem religious than really to be so, it isa sign their religion is in vain. The not bridling the tongue,readiness to speak of the faults of others, or to lessen their wisdomand piety, are signs of a vain religion. The man who has a slanderingtongue, cannot have a truly humble, gracious heart. False religious maybe known by their impurity and uncharitableness. True religion teachesus to do every thing as in the presence of God. An unspotted life mustgo with unfeigned love and charity. Our true religion is equal to themeasure in which these things have place in our hearts and conduct. Andlet us remember, that nothing avails in Christ Jesus, but faith thatworketh by love, purifies the heart, subdues carnal lusts, and obeysGod's commands.
Jam 2:1-13	<br>Those who profess faith in Christ as the Lord of glory, must notrespect persons on account of mere outward circumstances andappearances, in a manner not agreeing with their profession of beingdisciples of the lowly Jesus. St. James does not here encouragerudeness or disorder: civil respect must be paid; but never such as toinfluence the proceedings of Christians in disposing of the offices ofthe church of Christ, or in passing the censures of the church, or inany matter of religion. Questioning ourselves is of great use in everypart of the holy life. Let us be more frequent in this, and in everything take occasion to discourse with our souls. As places of worshipcannot be built or maintained without expense, it may be proper thatthose who contribute thereto should be accommodated accordingly; butwere all persons more spiritually-minded, the poor would be treatedwith more attention that usually is the case in worshippingcongregations. A lowly state is most favourable for inward peace andfor growth in holiness. God would give to all believers riches andhonours of this world, if these would do them good, seeing that he haschosen them to be rich in faith, and made them heirs of his kingdom,which he promised to bestow on all who love him. Consider how oftenriches lead to vice and mischief, and what great reproaches are thrownupon God and religion, by men of wealth, power, and worldly greatness;and it will make this sin appear very sinful and foolish. The Scripturegives as a law, to love our neighbour as ourselves. This law is a royallaw, it comes from the King of kings; and if Christians act unjustly,they are convicted by the law as transgressors. To think that our gooddeeds will atone for our bad deeds, plainly puts us upon looking foranother atonement. According to the covenant of works, one breach ofany one command brings a man under condemnation, from which noobedience, past, present, or future, can deliver him. This shows us thehappiness of those that are in Christ. We may serve him without slavishfear. God's restraints are not a bondage, but our own corruptions areso. The doom passed upon impenitent sinners at last, will be judgmentwithout mercy. But God deems it his glory and joy, to pardon and blessthose who might justly be condemned at his tribunal; and his graceteaches those who partake of his mercy, to copy it in their conduct.
Jam 2:14-26	<br>Those are wrong who put a mere notional belief of the gospel for thewhole of evangelical religion, as many now do. No doubt, true faithalone, whereby men have part in Christ's righteousness, atonement, andgrace, saves their souls; but it produces holy fruits, and is shown tobe real by its effect on their works; while mere assent to any form ofdoctrine, or mere historical belief of any facts, wholly differs fromthis saving faith. A bare profession may gain the good opinion of piouspeople; and it may procure, in some cases, worldly good things; butwhat profit will it be, for any to gain the whole world, and to losetheir souls? Can this faith save him? All things should be accountedprofitable or unprofitable to us, as they tend to forward or hinder thesalvation of our souls. This place of Scripture plainly shows that anopinion, or assent to the gospel, without works, is not faith. There isno way to show we really believe in Christ, but by being diligent ingood works, from gospel motives, and for gospel purposes. Men may boastto others, and be conceited of that which they really have not. Thereis not only to be assent in faith, but consent; not only an assent tothe truth of the word, but a consent to take Christ. True believing isnot an act of the understanding only, but a work of the whole heart.That a justifying faith cannot be without works, is shown from twoexamples, Abraham and Rahab. Abraham believed God, and it was reckonedunto him for righteousness. Faith, producing such works, advanced himto peculiar favours. We see then, 
Jam 2:24), how that by works a manis justified, not by a bare opinion or profession, or believing withoutobeying; but by having such faith as produces good works. And to haveto deny his own reason, affections, and interests, is an action fit totry a believer. Observe here, the wonderful power of faith in changingsinners. Rahab's conduct proved her faith to be living, or havingpower; it showed that she believed with her heart, not merely by anassent of the understanding. Let us then take heed, for the best works,without faith, are dead; they want root and principle. By faith anything we do is really good; as done in obedience to God, and aiming athis acceptance: the root is as though it were dead, when there is nofruit. Faith is the root, good works are the fruits; and we must see toit that we have both. This is the grace of God wherein we stand, and weshould stand to it. There is no middle state. Every one must eitherlive God's friend, or God's enemy. Living to God, as it is theconsequence of faith, which justifies and will save, obliges us to donothing against him, but every thing for him and to him.	
Jam 3:1-12	<br>We are taught to dread an unruly tongue, as one of the greatest evils.The affairs of mankind are thrown into confusion by the tongues of men.Every age of the world, and every condition of life, private or public,affords examples of this. Hell has more to do in promoting the fire ofthe tongue than men generally think; and whenever men's tongues areemployed in sinful ways, they are set on fire of hell. No man can tamethe tongue without Divine grace and assistance. The apostle does notrepresent it as impossible, but as extremely difficult. Other sinsdecay with age, this many times gets worse; we grow more froward andfretful, as natural strength decays, and the days come on in which wehave no pleasure. When other sins are tamed and subdued by theinfirmities of age, the spirit often grows more tart, nature beingdrawn down to the dregs, and the words used become more passionate.That man's tongue confutes itself, which at one time pretends to adorethe perfections of God, and to refer all things to him; and at anothertime condemns even good men, if they do not use the same words andexpressions. True religion will not admit of contradictions: how manysins would be prevented, if men would always be consistent! Pious andedifying language is the genuine produce of a sanctified heart; andnone who understand Christianity, expect to hear curses, lies,boastings, and revilings from a true believer's mouth, any more thanthey look for the fruit of one tree from another. But facts prove thatmore professors succeed in bridling their senses and appetites, than induly restraining their tongues. Then, depending on Divine grace, let ustake heed to bless and curse not; and let us aim to be consistent inour words and actions.
Jam 3:13-18	<br>These verses show the difference between men's pretending to be wise,and their being really so. He who thinks well, or he who talks well, isnot wise in the sense of the Scripture, if he does not live and actwell. True wisdom may be know by the meekness of the spirit and temper.Those who live in malice, envy, and contention, live in confusion; andare liable to be provoked and hurried to any evil work. Such wisdomcomes not down from above, but springs up from earthly principles, actson earthly motives, and is intent on serving earthly purposes. Thosewho are lifted up with such wisdom, described by the apostle James, isnear to the Christian love, described by the apostle Paul; and both areso described that every man may fully prove the reality of hisattainments in them. It has no disguise or deceit. It cannot fall inwith those managements the world counts wise, which are crafty andguileful; but it is sincere, and open, and steady, and uniform, andconsistent with itself. May the purity, peace, gentleness,teachableness, and mercy shown in all our actions, and the fruits ofrighteousness abounding in our lives, prove that God has bestowed uponus this excellent gift.
Jam 4:1-10	<br>Since all wars and fightings come from the corruptions of our ownhearts, it is right to mortify those lusts that war in the members.Wordly and fleshly lusts are distempers, which will not allow contentor satisfaction. Sinful desires and affections stop prayer, and theworking of our desires toward God. And let us beware that we do notabuse or misuse the mercies received, by the disposition of the heartwhen prayers are granted When men ask of God prosperity, they often askwith wrong aims and intentions. If we thus seek the things of thisworld, it is just in God to deny them. Unbelieving and cold desires begdenials; and we may be sure that when prayers are rather the languageof lusts than of graces, they will return empty. Here is a decidedwarning to avoid all criminal friendships with this world.Worldly-mindedness is enmity to God. An enemy may be reconciled, but"enmity" never can be reconciled. A man may have a large portion inthings of this life, and yet be kept in the love of God; but he whosets his heart upon the world, who will conform to it rather than loseits friendship, is an enemy to God. So that any one who resolves at allevents to be upon friendly terms with the world, must be the enemy ofGod. Did then the Jews, or the loose professors of Christianity, thinkthe Scripture spake in vain against this worldly-mindedness? or doesthe Holy Spirit who dwells in all Christians, or the new nature whichhe creates, produce such fruit? Natural corruption shows itself byenvying. The spirit of the world teaches us to lay up, or lay out forourselves, according to our own fancies; God the Holy Spirit teaches usto be willing to do good to all about us, as we are able. The grace ofGod will correct and cure the spirit by nature in us; and where hegives grace, he gives another spirit than that of the world. The proudresist God: in their understanding they resist the truths of God; intheir will they resist the laws of God; in their passions they resistthe providence of God; therefore, no wonder that God resists the proud.How wretched the state of those who make God their enemy! God will givemore grace to the humble, because they see their need of it, pray forit are thankful for it, and such shall have it. Submit to God, 
Jam 4:7	<br>Submit your understanding to the truth of God; submit your willsto the will of his precept, the will of his providence. Submityourselves to God, for he is ready to do you good. If we yield totemptations, the devil will continually follow us; but if we put on thewhole armour of God, and stand out against him, he will leave us. Letsinners then submit to God, and seek his grace and favour; resistingthe devil. All sin must be wept over; here, in godly sorrow, or,hereafter, in eternal misery. And the Lord will not refuse to comfortone who really mourns for sin, or to exalt one who humbles himselfbefore him.
Jam 4:11-17	<br>Our lips must be governed by the law of kindness, as well as truth andjustice. Christians are brethren. And to break God's commands, is tospeak evil of them, and to judge them, as if they laid too great arestraint upon us. We have the law of God, which is a rule to all; letus not presume to set up our own notions and opinions as a rule tothose about us, and let us be careful that we be not condemned of theLord. "Go to now," is a call to any one to consider his conduct asbeing wrong. How apt worldly and contriving men are to leave God out oftheir plans! How vain it is to look for any thing good without God'sblessing and guidance! The frailty, shortness, and uncertainty of life,ought to check the vanity and presumptuous confidence of all projectsfor futurity. We can fix the hour and minute of the sun's rising andsetting to-morrow, but we cannot fix the certain time of a vapour beingscattered. So short, unreal, and fading is human life, and all theprosperity or enjoyment that attends it; though bliss or woe for evermust be according to our conduct during this fleeting moment. We arealways to depend on the will of God. Our times are not in our ownhands, but at the disposal of God. Our heads may be filled with caresand contrivances for ourselves, or our families, or our friends; butProvidence often throws our plans into confusion. All we design, andall we do, should be with submissive dependence on God. It is foolish,and it is hurtful, to boast of worldly things and aspiring projects; itwill bring great disappointment, and will prove destruction in the end.Omissions are sins which will be brought into judgment, as well ascommissions. He that does not the good he knows should be done, as wellas he who does the evil he knows should not be done, will be condemned.Oh that we were as careful not to omit prayer, and not to neglect tomeditate and examine our consciences, as we are not to commit grossoutward vices against light!
Jam 5:1-6	<br>Public troubles are most grievous to those who live in pleasure, andare secure and sensual, though all ranks suffer deeply at such times.All idolized treasures will soon perish, except as they will rise up injudgment against their possessors. Take heed of defrauding andoppressing; and avoid the very appearance of it. God does not forbid usto use lawful pleasures; but to live in pleasure, especially sinfulpleasure, is a provoking sin. Is it no harm for people to unfitthemselves for minding the concerns of their souls, by indulging bodilyappetites? The just may be condemned and killed; but when such sufferby oppressors, this is marked by God. Above all their other crimes, theJews had condemned and crucified that Just One who had come among them,even Jesus Christ the righteous.
Jam 5:7-11	<br>Consider him that waits for a crop of corn; and will not you wait for acrown of glory? If you should be called to wait longer than thehusbandman, is not there something more worth waiting for? In everysense the coming of the Lord drew nigh, and all his people's losses,hardships, and sufferings, would be repaid. Men count time long,because they measure it by their own lives; but all time is as nothingto God; it is as a moment. To short-lived creatures a few years seem anage; but Scripture, measuring all things by the existence of God,reckons thousands of years but so many days. God brought about thingsin Job's case, so as plainly to prove that he is very pitiful and oftender mercy. This did not appear during his troubles, but was seen inthe event, and believers now will find a happy end to their trials. Letus serve our God, and bear our trials, as those who believe that theend will crown all. Our eternal happiness is safe if we trust to him:all else is mere vanity, which soon will be done with for ever.
Jam 5:12-18	<br>The sin of swearing is condemned; but how many make light of commonprofane swearing! Such swearing expressly throws contempt upon God'sname and authority. This sin brings neither gain, nor pleasure, norreputation, but is showing enmity to God without occasion and withoutadvantage It shows a man to be an enemy to God, however he pretends tocall himself by his name, or sometimes joins in acts of worship. Butthe Lord will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain. In aday of affliction nothing is more seasonable than prayer. The spirit isthen most humble, and the heart is broken and tender. It is necessaryto exercise faith and hope under afflictions; and prayer is theappointed means for obtaining and increasing these graces. Observe,that the saving of the sick is not ascribed to the anointing with oil,but to prayer. In a time of sickness it is not cold and formal prayerthat is effectual, but the prayer of faith. The great thing we shouldbeg of God for ourselves and others in the time of sickness is, thepardon of sin. Let nothing be done to encourage any to delay, under themistaken fancy that a confession, a prayer, a minister's absolution andexhortation, or the sacrament, will set all right at last, where theduties of a godly life have been disregarded. To acknowledge our faultsto each other, will tend greatly to peace and brotherly love. And whena righteous person, a true believer, justified in Christ, and by hisgrace walking before God in holy obedience, presents an effectualfervent prayer, wrought in his heart by the power of the Holy Spirit,raising holy affections and believing expectations and so leadingearnestly to plead the promises of God at his mercy-seat, it availsmuch. The power of prayer is proved from the history of Elijah. Inprayer we must not look to the merit of man, but to the grace of God.It is not enough to say a prayer, but we must pray in prayer. Thoughtsmust be fixed, desires must be firm and ardent, and graces exercised.This instance of the power of prayer, encourages every Christian to beearnest in prayer. God never says to any of the seed of Jacob, Seek myface in vain. Where there may not be so much of miracle in God'sanswering our prayers, yet there may be as much of grace.
Jam 5:19,20	<br>It is no mark of a wise or holy man, to boast of being free from error,or to refuse to acknowledge an error. And there is some doctrinalmistake at the bottom of every practical mistake. There is no onehabitually bad, but upon some bad principle. This is conversion; toturn a sinner from the error of his ways, not merely from one party toanother, or from one notion and way of thinking to another. There is noway effectually and finally to hide sin, but forsaking it. Many sinsare hindered in the party converted; many also may be so in others whomhe may influence. The salvation of one soul is of infinitely greaterimportance than preserving the lives of multitudes, or promoting thewelfare of a whole people. Let us in our several stations keep thesethings in mind, sparing no pains in God's service, and the event willprove that our labour is not in vain in the Lord. For six thousandyears He has been multiplying pardons, and yet his free grace is nottired nor grown weary. Certainly Divine mercy is an ocean that is everfull and ever flowing. May the Lord give us a part in this abundantmercy, through the blood of Christ, and the sanctification of theSpirit.
1Pe 1:1-9	<br>This epistle is addressed to believers in general, who are strangers inevery city or country where they live, and are scattered through thenations. These are to ascribe their salvation to the electing love ofthe Father, the redemption of the Son, and the sanctification of theHoly Ghost; and so to give glory to one God in three Persons, intowhose name they had been baptized. Hope, in the world's phrase, refersonly to an uncertain good, for all worldly hopes are tottering, builtupon sand, and the worldling's hopes of heaven are blind and groundlessconjectures. But the hope of the sons of the living God is a livinghope; not only as to its object, but as to its effect also. It enlivensand comforts in all distresses, enables to meet and get over alldifficulties. Mercy is the spring of all this; yea, great mercy andmanifold mercy. And this well-grounded hope of salvation, is an activeand living principle of obedience in the soul of the believer. Thematter of a Christian's joy, is the remembrance of the happiness laidup for him. It is incorruptible, it cannot come to nothing, it is anestate that cannot be spent. Also undefiled; this signifies its purityand perfection. And it fadeth not; is not sometimes more or lesspleasant, but ever the same, still like itself. All possessions hereare stained with defects and failings; still something is wanting: fairhouses have sad cares flying about the gilded and ceiled roofs; softbeds and full tables, are often with sick bodies and uneasy stomachs.All possessions are stained with sin, either in getting or in usingthem. How ready we are to turn the things we possess into occasions andinstruments of sin, and to think there is no liberty or delight intheir use, without abusing them! Worldly possessions are uncertain andsoon pass away, like the flowers and plants of the field. That must beof the greatest worth, which is laid up in the highest and best place,in heaven. Happy are those whose hearts the Holy Spirit sets on thisinheritance. God not only gives his people grace, but preserves themunto glory. Every believer has always something wherein he may greatlyrejoice; it should show itself in the countenance and conduct. The Lorddoes not willingly afflict, yet his wise love often appoints sharptrials, to show his people their hearts, and to do them good at thelatter end. Gold does not increase by trial in the fire, it becomesless; but faith is made firm, and multiplied, by troubles andafflictions. Gold must perish at last, and can only purchase perishingthings, while the trial of faith will be found to praise, and honour,and glory. Let this reconcile us to present afflictions. Seek then tobelieve Christ's excellence in himself, and his love to us; this willkindle such a fire in the heart as will make it rise up in a sacrificeof love to him. And the glory of God and our own happiness are sounited, that if we sincerely seek the one now, we shall attain theother when the soul shall no more be subject to evil. The certainty ofthis hope is as if believers had already received it.
1Pe 1:10-12	<br>Jesus Christ was the main subject of the prophets' studies. Theirinquiry into the sufferings of Christ and the glories that shouldfollow, would lead to a view of the whole gospel, the sum whereof is,That Christ Jesus was delivered for our offences, and raised again forour justification. God is pleased to answer our necessities rather thanour requests. The doctrine of the prophets, and that of the apostles,exactly agree, as coming from the same Spirit of God. The gospel is theministration of the Spirit; its success depends upon his operation andblessing. Let us then search diligently those Scriptures which containthe doctrines of salvation.
1Pe 1:13-16	<br>As the traveller, the racer, the warrior, and the labourer, gathered intheir long and loose garments, that they might be ready in theirbusiness, so let Christians do by their minds and affections. Be sober,be watchful against all spiritual dangers and enemies, and be temperatein all behaviour. Be sober-minded in opinion, as well as in practice,and humble in your judgment of yourselves. A strong and perfect trustin the grace of God, is agreeable with best endeavours in our duty.Holiness is the desire and duty of every Christian. It must be in allaffairs, in every condition, and towards all people. We must especiallywatch and pray against the sins to which we are inclined. The writtenword of God is the surest rule of a Christian's life, and by this rulewe are commanded to be holy every way. God makes those holy whom hesaves.
1Pe 1:17-25	<br>Holy confidence in God as a Father, and awful fear of him as a Judge,agree together; and to regard God always as a Judge, makes him dear tous as a Father. If believers do evil, God will visit them withcorrections. Then, let Christians not doubt God's faithfulness to hispromises, nor give way to enslaving dread of his wrath, but let themreverence his holiness. The fearless professor is defenceless, andSatan takes him captive at his will; the desponding professor has noheart to avail himself of his advantages, and is easily brought tosurrender. The price paid for man's redemption was the precious bloodof Christ. Not only openly wicked, but unprofitable conversation ishighly dangerous, though it may plead custom. It is folly to resolve, Iwill live and die in such a way, because my forefathers did so. God hadpurposes of special favour toward his people, long before he mademanifest such grace unto them. But the clearness of light, the supportsof faith, the power of ordinances, are all much greater since Christcame upon earth, than they were before. The comfort is, that being byfaith made one with Christ, his present glory is an assurance thatwhere he is we shall be also, Joh 14:3. The soul must be purified,before it can give up its own desires and indulgences. And the word ofGod planted in the heart by the Holy Ghost, is a means of spirituallife, stirring up to our duty, working a total change in thedispositions and affections of the soul, till it brings to eternallife. In contrast with the excellence of the renewed spiritual man, asborn again, observe the vanity of the natural man. In his life, and inhis fall, he is like grass, the flower of grass, which soon withers anddies away. We should hear, and thus receive and love, the holy, livingword, and rather hazard all than lose it; and we must banish all otherthings from the place due to it. We should lodge it in our hearts asour only treasures here, and the certain pledge of the treasure ofglory laid up for believers in heaven.
1Pe 2:1-10	<br>Evil-speaking is a sign of malice and guile in the heart; and hindersour profiting by the word of God. A new life needs suitable food.Infants desire milk, and make the best endeavours for it which they areable to do; such must be a Christian's desires after the word of God.Our Lord Jesus Christ is very merciful to us miserable sinners; and hehas a fulness of grace. But even the best of God's servants, in thislife, have only a taste of the consolations of God. Christ is called aStone, to teach his servants that he is their protection and security,the foundation on which they are built. He is precious in theexcellence of his nature, the dignity of his office, and the glory ofhis services. All true believers are a holy priesthood; sacred to God,serviceable to others, endowed with heavenly gifts and graces. But themost spiritual sacrifices of the best in prayer and praise are notacceptable, except through Jesus Christ. Christ is the chiefCorner-stone, that unites the whole number of believers into oneeverlasting temple, and bears the weight of the whole fabric. Elected,or chosen, for a foundation that is everlasting. Precious beyondcompare, by all that can give worth. To be built on Christ means, tobelieve in him; but in this many deceive themselves, they consider notwhat it is, nor the necessity of it, to partake of the salvation he haswrought. Though the frame of the world were falling to pieces, that manwho is built on this foundation may hear it without fear. He shall notbe confounded. The believing soul makes haste to Christ, but it neverfinds cause to hasten from him. All true Christians are a chosengeneration; they make one family, a people distinct from the world: ofanother spirit, principle, and practice; which they could never be, ifthey were not chosen in Christ to be such, and sanctified by hisSpirit. Their first state is a state of gross darkness, but they arecalled out of darkness into a state of joy, pleasure, and prosperity;that they should show forth the praises of the Lord by their professionof his truth, and their good conduct. How vast their obligations to Himwho has made them his people, and has shown mercy to them! To bewithout this mercy is a woful state, though a man have all worldlyenjoyments. And there is nothing that so kindly works repentance, asright thoughts of the mercy and love of God. Let us not dare to abuseand affront the free grace of God, if we mean to be saved by it; butlet all who would be found among those who obtain mercy, walk as hispeople.
1Pe 2:11,12	<br>Even the best of men, the chosen generation, the people of God, need tobe exhorted to keep from the worst sins. And fleshly lusts are mostdestructive to man's soul. It is a sore judgment to be given up tothem. There is a day of visitation coming, wherein God may call torepentance by his word and his grace; then many will glorify God, andthe holy lives of his people will have promoted the happy change.
1Pe 2:13-17	<br>A Christian conversation must be honest; which it cannot be, if thereis not a just and careful discharge of all relative duties: the apostlehere treats of these distinctly. Regard to those duties is the will ofGod, consequently, the Christian's duty, and the way to silence thebase slanders of ignorant and foolish men. Christians must endeavour,in all relations, to behave aright, that they do not make their libertya cloak or covering for any wickedness, or for the neglect of duty; butthey must remember that they are servants of God.
1Pe 2:18-25	<br>Servants in those days generally were slaves, and had heathen masters,who often used them cruelly; yet the apostle directs them to be subjectto the masters placed over them by Providence, with a fear to dishonouror offend God. And not only to those pleased with reasonable service,but to the severe, and those angry without cause. The sinful misconductof one relation, does not justify sinful behaviour in the other; theservant is bound to do his duty, though the master may be sinfullyfroward and perverse. But masters should be meek and gentle to theirservants and inferiors. What glory or distinction could it be, forprofessed Christians to be patient when corrected for their faults? Butif when they behaved well they were ill treated by proud and passionateheathen masters, yet bore it without peevish complaints, or purposes ofrevenge, and persevered in their duty, this would be acceptable to Godas a distinguishing effect of his grace, and would be rewarded by him.Christ's death was designed not only for an example of patience undersufferings, but he bore our sins; he bore the punishment of them, andthereby satisfied Divine justice. Hereby he takes them away from us.The fruits of Christ's sufferings are the death of sin, and a new holylife of righteousness; for both which we have an example, and powerfulmotives, and ability to perform also, from the death and resurrectionof Christ. And our justification; Christ was bruised and crucified as asacrifice for our sins, and by his stripes the diseases of our soulsare cured. Here is man's sin; he goes astray; it is his own act. Hismisery; he goes astray from the pasture, from the Shepherd, and fromthe flock, and so exposes himself to dangers without number. Here isthe recovery by conversion; they are now returned as the effect ofDivine grace. This return is, from all their errors and wanderings, toChrist. Sinners, before their conversion, are always going astray;their life is a continued error.
1Pe 3:1-7	<br>The wife must discharge her duty to her own husband, though he obey notthe word. We daily see how narrowly evil men watch the ways and livesof professors of religion. Putting on of apparel is not forbidden, butvanity and costliness in ornament. Religious people should take carethat all their behaviour answers to their profession. But how few knowthe right measure and bounds of those two necessaries of life, food andraiment! Unless poverty is our carver, and cuts us short, there isscarcely any one who does not desire something beyond what is good forus. Far more are beholden to the lowliness of their state, than thelowliness of their mind; and many will not be so bounded, but lavishtheir time and money upon trifles. The apostle directs Christianfemales to put on something not corruptible, that beautifies the soul,even the graces of God's Holy Spirit. A true Christian's chief carelies in right ordering his own spirit. This will do more to fix theaffections, and excite the esteem of a husband, than studied ornamentsor fashionable apparel, attended by a froward and quarrelsome temper.Christians ought to do their duty to one another, from a willing mind,and in obedience to the command of God. Wives should be subject totheir husbands, not from dread and amazement, but from desire to dowell, and please God. The husband's duty to the wife implies giving duerespect unto her, and maintaining her authority, protecting her, andplacing trust in her. They are heirs together of all the blessings ofthis life and that which is to come, and should live peaceably one withanother. Prayer sweetens their converse. And it is not enough that theypray with the family, but husband and wife together by themselves, andwith their children. Those who are acquainted with prayer, find suchunspeakable sweetness in it, that they will not be hindered therein.That you may pray much, live holily; and that you may live holily, bemuch in prayer.
1Pe 3:8-13	<br>Though Christians cannot always be exactly of the same mind, yet theyshould have compassion one of another, and love as brethren. If any mandesires to live comfortably on earth, or to possess eternal life inheaven, he must bridle his tongue from wicked, abusive, or deceitfulwords. He must forsake and keep far from evil actions, do all the goodhe can, and seek peace with all men. For God, all-wise and every wherepresent, watches over the righteous, and takes care of them. None couldor should harm those who copied the example of Christ, who is perfectgoodness, and did good to others as his followers.
1Pe 3:14-22	<br>We sanctify God before others, when our conduct invites and encouragesthem to glorify and honour him. What was the ground and reason of theirhope? We should be able to defend our religion with meekness, in thefear of God. There is no room for any other fears where this great fearis; it disturbs not. The conscience is good, when it does its officewell. That person is in a sad condition on whom sin and suffering meet:sin makes suffering extreme, comfortless, and destructive. Surely it isbetter to suffer for well-doing than for evil-doing, whatever ournatural impatience at times may suggest. The example of Christ is anargument for patience under sufferings. In the case of our Lord'ssuffering, he that knew no sin, suffered instead of those who knew norighteousness. The blessed end and design of our Lord's sufferingswere, to reconcile us to God, and to bring us to eternal glory. He wasput to death in respect of his human nature, but was quickened andraised by the power of the Holy Spirit. If Christ could not be freedfrom sufferings, why should Christians think to be so? God takes exactnotice of the means and advantages people in all ages have had. As tothe old world, Christ sent his Spirit; gave warning by Noah. But thoughthe patience of God waits long, it will cease at last. And the spiritsof disobedient sinners, as soon as they are out of their bodies, arecommitted to the prison of hell, where those that despised Noah'swarning now are, and from whence there is no redemption. Noah'ssalvation in the ark upon the water, which carried him above thefloods, set forth the salvation of all true believers. That temporalsalvation by the ark was a type of the eternal salvation of believersby baptism of the Holy Spirit. To prevent mistakes, the apostledeclares what he means by saving baptism; not the outward ceremony ofwashing with water, which, in itself, does no more than put away thefilth of the flesh, but that baptism, of which the baptismal waterformed the sign. Not the outward ordinance, but when a man, by theregeneration of the Spirit, was enabled to repent and profess faith,and purpose a new life, uprightly, and as in the presence of God. Letus beware that we rest not upon outward forms. Let us learn to look onthe ordinances of God spiritually, and to inquire after the spiritualeffect and working of them on our consciences. We would willingly haveall religion reduced to outward things. But many who were baptized, andconstantly attended the ordinances, have remained without Christ, diedin their sins, and are now past recovery. Rest not then till thou artcleansed by the Spirit of Christ and the blood of Christ. Hisresurrection from the dead is that whereby we are assured of purifyingand peace.
1Pe 4:1-6	<br>The strongest and best arguments against sin, are taken from thesufferings of Christ. He died to destroy sin; and though he cheerfullysubmitted to the worst sufferings, yet he never gave way to the leastsin. Temptations could not prevail, were it not for man's owncorruption; but true Christians make the will of God, not their ownlust or desires, the rule of their lives and actions. And trueconversion makes a marvellous change in the heart and life. It altersthe mind, judgment, affections, and conversation. When a man is trulyconverted, it is very grievous to him to think how the time past of hislife has been spent. One sin draws on another. Six sins are herementioned which have dependence one upon another. It is a Christian'sduty, not only to keep from gross wickedness, but also from things thatlead to sin, or appear evil. The gospel had been preached to thosesince dead, who by the proud and carnal judgment of wicked men werecondemned as evil-doers, some even suffering death. But being quickenedto Divine life by the Holy Spirit, they lived to God as his devotedservants. Let not believers care, though the world scorns andreproaches them.
1Pe 4:7-11	<br>The destruction of the Jewish church and nation, foretold by ourSaviour, was very near. And the speedy approach of death and judgmentconcerns all, to which these words naturally lead our minds. Ourapproaching end, is a powerful argument to make us sober in all worldlymatters, and earnest in religion. There are so many things amiss inall, that unless love covers, excuses, and forgives in others, themistakes and faults for which every one needs the forbearance ofothers, Satan will prevail to stir up divisions and discords. But weare not to suppose that charity will cover or make amends for the sinsof those who exercise it, so as to induce God to forgive them. Thenature of a Christian's work, which is high work and hard work, thegoodness of the Master, and the excellence of the reward, all requirethat our endeavours should be serious and earnest. And in all theduties and services of life, we should aim at the glory of God as ourchief end. He is a miserable, unsettled wretch, who cleaves to himself,and forgets God; is only perplexed about his credit, and gain, and baseends, which are often broken, and which, when he attains, both he andthey must shortly perish together. But he who has given up himself andhis all to God, may say confidently that the Lord is his portion; andnothing but glory through Christ Jesus, is solid and lasting; thatabideth for ever.
1Pe 4:12-19	<br>By patience and fortitude in suffering, by dependence on the promisesof God, and keeping to the word the Holy Spirit hath revealed, the HolySpirit is glorified; but by the contempt and reproaches cast uponbelievers, he is evil spoken of, and is blasphemed. One would thinksuch cautions as these were needless to Christians. But their enemiesfalsely charged them with foul crimes. And even the best of men need tobe warned against the worst of sins. There is no comfort in sufferings,when we bring them upon ourselves by our own sin and folly. A time ofuniversal calamity was at hand, as foretold by our Saviour, Mt 24:9,10. And if such things befall in this life, how awful will the day ofjudgment be! It is true that the righteous are scarcely saved; eventhose who endeavour to walk uprightly in the ways of God. This does notmean that the purpose and performance of God are uncertain, but onlythe great difficulties and hard encounters in the way; that they gothrough so many temptations and tribulations, so many fightings withoutand fears within. Yet all outward difficulties would be as nothing,were it not for lusts and corruptions within. These are the worst clogsand troubles. And if the way of the righteous be so hard, then how hardshall be the end of the ungodly sinner, who walks in sin with delight,and thinks the righteous is a fool for all his pains! The only way tokeep the soul well, is, to commit it to God by prayer, and patientperseverance in well-doing. He will overrule all to the final advantageof the believer.
1Pe 5:1-4	<br>The apostle Peter does not command, but exhorts. He does not claimpower to rule over all pastors and churches. It was the peculiar honourof Peter and a few more, to be witnesses of Christ's sufferings; but itis the privilege of all true Christians to partake of the glory thatshall be revealed. These poor, dispersed, suffering Christians, werethe flock of God, redeemed to God by the great Shepherd, living in holylove and communion, according to the will of God. They are alsodignified with the title of God's heritage or clergy; his peculiar lot,chosen for his own people, to enjoy his special favour, and to do himspecial service. Christ is the chief Shepherd of the whole flock andheritage of God. And all faithful ministers will receive a crown ofunfading glory, infinitely better and more honourable than all theauthority, wealth, and pleasure of the world.
1Pe 5:5-9	<br>Humility preserves peace and order in all Christian churches andsocieties; pride disturbs them. Where God gives grace to be humble, hewill give wisdom, faith, and holiness. To be humble, and subject to ourreconciled God, will bring greater comfort to the soul than thegratification of pride and ambition. But it is to be in due time; notin thy fancied time, but God's own wisely appointed time. Does he wait,and wilt not thou? What difficulties will not the firm belief of hiswisdom, power, and goodness get over! Then be humble under his hand.Cast "all you care;" personal cares, family cares, cares for thepresent, and cares for the future, for yourselves, for others, for thechurch, on God. These are burdensome, and often very sinful, when theyarise from unbelief and distrust, when they torture and distract themind, unfit us for duties, and hinder our delight in the service ofGod. The remedy is, to cast our care upon God, and leave every event tohis wise and gracious disposal. Firm belief that the Divine will andcounsels are right, calms the spirit of a man. Truly the godly toooften forget this, and fret themselves to no purpose. Refer all toGod's disposal. The golden mines of all spiritual comfort and good arewholly his, and the Spirit itself. Then, will he not furnish what isfit for us, if we humbly attend on him, and lay the care of providingfor us, upon his wisdom and love? The whole design of Satan is todevour and destroy souls. He always is contriving whom he may insnareto eternal ruin. Our duty plainly is, to be sober; to govern both theoutward and the inward man by the rules of temperance. To be vigilant;suspicious of constant danger from this spiritual enemy, watchful anddiligent to prevent his designs. Be stedfast, or solid, by faith. A mancannot fight upon a quagmire, there is no standing without firm groundto tread upon; this faith alone furnishes. It lifts the soul to thefirm advanced ground of the promises, and fixes it there. Theconsideration of what others suffer, is proper to encourage us to bearour share in any affliction; and in whatever form Satan assaults us, orby whatever means, we may know that our brethren experience the same.
1Pe 5:10-14	<br>In conclusion, the apostle prays to God for them, as the God of allgrace. Perfect implies their progress towards perfection. Stablishimports the curing of our natural lightness and inconstancy. Strengthenhas respect to the growth of graces, especially where weakest andlowest. Settle signifies to fix upon a sure foundation, and may referto Him who is the Foundation and Strength of believers. Theseexpressions show that perseverance and progress in grace are first tobe sought after by every Christian. The power of these doctrines on thehearts, and the fruits in the lives, showed who are partakers of thegrace of God. The cherishing and increase of Christian love, and ofaffection one to another, is no matter of empty compliment, but thestamp and badge of Jesus Christ on his followers. Others may have afalse peace for a time, and wicked men may wish for it to themselvesand to one another; but theirs is a vain hope, and will come to nought.All solid peace is founded on Christ, and flows from him.
2Pe 1:1-11	<br>Faith unites the weak believer to Christ, as really as it does thestrong one, and purifies the heart of one as truly as of another; andevery sincere believer is by his faith justified in the sight of God.Faith worketh godliness, and produces effects which no other grace inthe soul can do. In Christ all fulness dwells, and pardon, peace,grace, and knowledge, and new principles, are thus given through theHoly Spirit. The promises to those who are partakers of a Divinenature, will cause us to inquire whether we are really renewed in thespirit of our minds; let us turn all these promises into prayers forthe transforming and purifying grace of the Holy Spirit. The believermust add knowledge to his virtue, increasing acquaintance with thewhole truth and will of God. We must add temperance to knowledge;moderation about worldly things; and add to temperance, patience, orcheerful submission to the will of God. Tribulation worketh patience,whereby we bear all calamities and crosses with silence and submission.To patience we must add godliness: this includes the holy affectionsand dispositions found in the true worshipper of God; with tenderaffection to all fellow Christians, who are children of the sameFather, servants of the same Master, members of the same family,travellers to the same country, heirs of the same inheritance.Wherefore let Christians labour to attain assurance of their calling,and of their election, by believing and well-doing; and thus carefullyto endeavour, is a firm argument of the grace and mercy of God,upholding them so that they shall not utterly fall. Those who arediligent in the work of religion, shall have a triumphant entrance intothat everlasting kingdom where Christ reigns, and they shall reign withhim for ever and ever; and it is in the practice of every good workthat we are to expect entrance to heaven.
2Pe 1:12-15	<br>We must be established in the belief of the truth, that we may not beshaken by every wind of doctrine; and especially in the truth necessaryfor us to know in our day, what belongs to our peace, and what isopposed in our time. The body is but a tabernacle, or tent, of thesoul. It is a mean and movable dwelling. The nearness of death makesthe apostle diligent in the business of life. Nothing can so givecomposure in the prospect, or in the hour, of death, as to know that wehave faithfully and simply followed the Lord Jesus, and sought hisglory. Those who fear the Lord, talk of his loving-kindness. This isthe way to spread the knowledge of the Lord; and by the written word,they are enabled to do this.
2Pe 1:16-21	<br>The gospel is no weak thing, but comes in power, Ro 1:16. The law setsbefore us our wretched state by sin, but there it leaves us. Itdiscovers our disease, but does not make known the cure. It is thesight of Jesus crucified, in the gospel, that heals the soul. Try todissuade the covetous worlding from his greediness, one ounce of goldweighs down all reasons. Offer to stay a furious man from anger byarguments, he has not patience to hear them. Try to detain thelicentious, one smile is stronger with him than all reason. But comewith the gospel, and urge them with the precious blood of Jesus Christ,shed to save their souls from hell, and to satisfy for their sins, andthis is that powerful pleading which makes good men confess that theirhearts burn within them, and bad men, even an Agrippa, to say they arealmost persuaded to be Christians, Ac 26:28. God is well pleased withChrist, and with us in him. This is the Messiah who was promised,through whom all who believe in him shall be accepted and saved. Thetruth and reality of the gospel also are foretold by the prophets andpenmen of the Old Testament, who spake and wrote under influence, andaccording to the direction of the Spirit of God. How firm and sureshould our faith be, who have such a firm and sure word to rest upon!When the light of the Scripture is darted into the blind mind and darkunderstanding, by the Holy Spirit of God, it is like the day-break thatadvances, and diffuses itself through the whole soul, till it makesperfect day. As the Scripture is the revelation of the mind and will ofGod, every man ought to search it, to understand the sense and meaning.The Christian knows that book to be the word of God, in which he tastesa sweetness, and feels a power, and sees a glory, truly divine. And theprophecies already fulfilled in the person and salvation of Christ, andin the great concerns of the church and the world, form an unanswerableproof of the truth of Christianity. The Holy Ghost inspired holy men tospeak and write. He so assisted and directed them in delivering whatthey had received from him, that they clearly expressed what they madeknown. So that the Scriptures are to be accounted the words of the HolyGhost, and all the plainness and simplicity, all the power and all thepropriety of the words and expressions, come from God. Mix faith withwhat you find in the Scriptures, and esteem and reverence the Bible asa book written by holy men, taught by the Holy Ghost.
2Pe 2:1-9	<br>Though the way of error is a hurtful way, many are always ready to walktherein. Let us take care we give no occasion to the enemy to blasphemethe holy name whereby we are called, or to speak evil of the way ofsalvation by Jesus Christ, who is the Way, the Truth, and the Life.These seducers used feigned words, they deceived the hearts of theirfollowers. Such are condemned already, and the wrath of God abides uponthem. God's usual method of proceeding is shown by examples. Angelswere cast down from all their glory and dignity, for theirdisobedience. If creatures sin, even in heaven, they must suffer inhell. Sin is the work of darkness, and darkness is the wages of sin.See how God dealt with the old world. The number of offenders no moreprocures favour, than their quality. If the sin be universal, thepunishment shall likewise extend to all. If in a fruitful soil thepeople abound in sin, God can at once turn a fruitful land intobarrenness, and a well-watered country into ashes. No plans or politicscan keep off judgments from a sinful people. He who keeps fire andwater from hurting his people, Isa 43:2, can make either destroy hisenemies; they are never safe. When God sends destruction on theungodly, he commands deliverance for the righteous. In bad company wecannot but get either guilt or grief. Let the sins of others betroubles to us. Yet it is possible for the children of the Lord, livingamong the most profane, to retain their integrity; there being morepower in the grace of Christ, and his dwelling in them, than in thetemptations of Satan, or the example of the wicked, with all theirterrors or allurements. In our intentions and inclinations to commitsin, we meet with strange hinderances, if we mark them When we intendmischief, God sends many stops to hinder us, as if to say, Take heedwhat you do. His wisdom and power will surely effect the purposes ofhis love, and the engagements of his truth; while wicked men oftenescape suffering here, because they are kept to the day of judgment, tobe punished with the devil and his angels.
2Pe 2:10-16	<br>Impure seducers and their abandoned followers, give themselves up totheir own fleshly minds. Refusing to bring every thought to theobedience of Christ, they act against God's righteous precepts. Theywalk after the flesh, they go on in sinful courses, and increase togreater degrees of impurity and wickedness. They also despise thosewhom God has set in authority over them, and requires them to honour.Outward temporal good things are the wages sinners expect and promisethemselves. And none have more cause to tremble, than those who arebold to gratify their sinful lusts, by presuming on the Divine graceand mercy. Many such there have been, and are, who speak lightly of therestraints of God's law, and deem themselves freed from obligations toobey it. Let Christians stand at a distance from such.
2Pe 2:17-22	<br>The word of truth is the water of life, which refreshes the souls thatreceive it; but deceivers spread and promote error, and are set forthas empty, because there is no truth in them. As clouds hinder the lightof the sun, so do these darken counsel by words wherein there is notruth. Seeing that these men increase darkness in this world, it isvery just that the mist of darkness should be their portion in thenext. In the midst of their talk of liberty, these men are the vilestslaves; their own lusts gain a complete victory over them, and they areactually in bondage. When men are entangled, they are easily overcome;therefore Christians should keep close to the word of God, and watchagainst all who seek to bewilder them. A state of apostacy is worsethan a state of ignorance. To bring an evil report upon the good way ofGod, and a false charge against the way of truth, must expose to theheaviest condemnation. How dreadful is the state here described! Yetthough such a case is deplorable, it is not utterly hopeless; the lepermay be made clean, and even the dead may be raised. Is thy backslidinga grief to thee? Believe in the Lord Jesus, and thou shalt be saved.
2Pe 3:1-4	<br>The purified minds of Christians are to be stirred up, that they may beactive and lively in the work of holiness. There will be scoffers inthe last days, under the gospel, men who make light of sin, and mock atsalvation by Jesus Christ. One very principal article of our faithrefers to what only has a promise to rest upon, and scoffers willattack it till our Lord is come. They will not believe that he willcome. Because they see no changes, therefore they fear not God, Ps55:19. What he never has done, they fancy he never can do, or neverwill do.
2Pe 3:5-10	<br>Had these scoffers considered the dreadful vengeance with which Godswept away a whole world of ungodly men at once, surely they would nothave scoffed at his threatening an equally terrible judgment. Theheavens and the earth which now are, by the same word, it is declared,will be destroyed by fire. This is as sure to come, as the truth andthe power of God can make it. Christians are here taught andestablished in the truth of the coming of the Lord. Though, in theaccount of men, there is a vast difference between one day and athousand years, yet, in the account of God, there is no difference. Allthings past, present, and future, are ever before him: the delay of athousand years cannot be so much to him, as putting off any thing for aday or for an hour is to us. If men have no knowledge or belief of theeternal God, they will be very apt to think him such as themselves. Howhard is it to form any thoughts of eternity! What men count slackness,is long-suffering, and that to us-ward; it is giving more time to hisown people, to advance in knowledge and holiness, and in the exerciseof faith and patience, to abound in good works, doing and sufferingwhat they are called to, that they may bring glory to God. Settletherefore in your hearts that you shall certainly be called to give anaccount of all things done in the body, whether good or evil. And let ahumble and diligent walking before God, and a frequent judging ofyourselves, show a firm belief of the future judgment, though many liveas if they were never to give any account at all. This day will come,when men are secure, and have no expectation of the day of the Lord.The stately palaces, and all the desirable things wherein wordly-mindedmen seek and place their happiness, shall be burned up; all sorts ofcreatures God has made, and all the works of men, must pass through thefire, which shall be a consuming fire to all that sin has brought intothe world, though a refining fire to the works of God's hand. What willbecome of us, if we set our affections on this earth, and make it ourportion, seeing all these things shall be burned up? Therefore makesure of happiness beyond this visible world.
2Pe 3:11-18	<br>From the doctrine of Christ's second coming, we are exhorted to purityand godliness. This is the effect of real knowledge. Very exact anduniversal holiness is enjoined, not resting in any low measure ordegree. True Christians look for new heavens and a new earth; freedfrom the vanity to which things present are subject, and the sin theyare polluted with. Those only who are clothed with the righteousness ofChrist, and sanctified by the Holy Ghost, shall be admitted to dwell inthis holy place. He is faithful, who has promised. Those, whose sinsare pardoned, and their peace made with God, are the only safe andhappy people; therefore follow after peace, and that with all men;follow after holiness as well as peace. Never expect to be found atthat day of God in peace, if you are lazy and idle in this your day, inwhich we must finish the work given us to do. Only the diligentChristian will be the happy Christian in the day of the Lord. Our Lordwill suddenly come to us, or shortly call us to him; and shall he findus idle? Learn to make a right use of the patience of our Lord, who asyet delays his coming. Proud, carnal, and corrupt men, seek to wrestsome things into a seeming agreement with their wicked doctrines. Butthis is no reason why St. Paul's epistles, or any other part of theScriptures, should be laid aside; for men, left to themselves, pervertevery gift of God. Then let us seek to have our minds prepared forreceiving things hard to be understood, by putting in practice thingswhich are more easy to be understood. But there must be self-denial andsuspicion of ourselves, and submission to the authority of ChristJesus, before we can heartily receive all the truths of the gospel,therefore we are in great danger of rejecting the truth. And whateveropinions and thoughts of men are not according to the law of God, andwarranted by it, the believer disclaims and abhors. Those who are ledaway by error, fall from their own stedfastness. And that we may avoidbeing led away, we must seek to grow in all grace, in faith, andvirtue, and knowledge. Labour to know Christ more clearly, and morefully; to know him so as to be more like him, and to love him better.This is the knowledge of Christ, which the apostle Paul reached after,and desired to attain; and those who taste this effect of the knowledgeof the Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, will, upon receiving such gracefrom him, give thanks and praise him, and join in ascribing glory tohim now, in the full assurance of doing the same hereafter, for ever.
1Jo 1:1-4	<br>That essential Good, that uncreated Excellence, which had been from thebeginning, from eternity, as equal with the Father, and which at lengthappeared in human nature for the salvation of sinners, was the greatsubject concerning which the apostle wrote to his brethren. Theapostles had seen Him while they witnessed his wisdom and holiness, hismiracles, and love and mercy, during some years, till they saw himcrucified for sinners, and afterwards risen from the dead. They touchedhim, so as to have full proof of his resurrection. This Divine Person,the Word of life, the Word of God, appeared in human nature, that hemight be the Author and Giver of eternal life to mankind, through theredemption of his blood, and the influence of his new-creating Spirit.The apostles declared what they had seen and heard, that believersmight share their comforts and everlasting advantages. They had freeaccess to God the Father. They had a happy experience of the truth intheir souls, and showed its excellence in their lives. This communionof believers with the Father and the Son, is begun and kept up by theinfluences of the Holy Spirit. The benefits Christ bestows, are notlike the scanty possessions of the world, causing jealousies in others;but the joy and happiness of communion with God is all-sufficient, sothat any number may partake of it; and all who are warranted to say,that truly their fellowship is with the Father, will desire to leadothers to partake of the same blessedness.
1Jo 1:5-10	<br>A message from the Lord Jesus, the Word of life, the eternal Word, weshould all gladly receive. The great God should be represented to thisdark world, as pure and perfect light. As this is the nature of God,his doctrines and precepts must be such. And as his perfect happinesscannot be separated from his perfect holiness, so our happiness will bein proportion to our being made holy. To walk in darkness, is to liveand act against religion. God holds no heavenly fellowship orintercourse with unholy souls. There is no truth in their profession;their practice shows its folly and falsehood. The eternal Life, theeternal Son, put on flesh and blood, and died to wash us from our sinsin his own blood, and procures for us the sacred influences by whichsin is to be subdued more and more, till it is quite done away. Whilethe necessity of a holy walk is insisted upon, as the effect andevidence of the knowledge of God in Christ Jesus, the opposite error ofself-righteous pride is guarded against with equal care. All who walknear to God, in holiness and righteousness, are sensible that theirbest days and duties are mixed with sin. God has given testimony to thesinfulness of the world, by providing a sufficient, effectual Sacrificefor sin, needed in all ages; and the sinfulness of believers themselvesis shown, by requiring them continually to confess their sins, and toapply by faith to the blood of that Sacrifice. Let us plead guiltybefore God, be humble, and willing to know the worst of our case. Letus honestly confess all our sins in their full extent, relying whollyon his mercy and truth through the righteousness of Christ, for a freeand full forgiveness, and our deliverance from the power and practiceof sin.
1Jo 2:1,2	<br>When have an Advocate with the Father; one who has undertaken, and isfully able, to plead in behalf of every one who applies for pardon andsalvation in his name, depending on his pleading for them. He is"Jesus," the Saviour, and "Christ," the Messiah, the Anointed. He aloneis "the Righteous One," who received his nature pure from sin, and asour Surety perfectly obeyed the law of God, and so fulfilled allrighteousness. All men, in every land, and through successivegenerations, are invited to come to God through this all-sufficientatonement, and by this new and living way. The gospel, when rightlyunderstood and received, sets the heart against all sin, and stops theallowed practice of it; at the same time it gives blessed relief to thewounded consciences of those who have sinned.
1Jo 2:3-11	<br>What knowledge of Christ can that be, which sees not that he is mostworthy of our entire obedience? And a disobedient life shows there isneither religion nor honesty in the professor. The love of God isperfected in him that keeps his commandments. God's grace in himattains its true mark, and produces its sovereign effect as far as maybe in this world, and this is man's regeneration; though neverabsolutely perfect here. Yet this observing Christ's commands, hasholiness and excellency which, if universal, would make the earthresemble heaven itself. The command to love one another had been inforce from the beginning of the world; but it might be called a newcommand as given to Christians. It was new in them, as their situationwas new in respect of its motives, rules, and obligations. And thosewho walk in hatred and enmity to believers, remain in a dark state.Christian love teaches us to value our brother's soul, and to dreadevery thing hurtful to his purity and peace. Where spiritual darknessdwells, in mind, the judgment, and the conscience will be darkened, andwill mistake the way to heavenly life. These things demand seriousself-examination; and earnest prayer, that God would show us what weare, and whither we are going.
1Jo 2:12-14	<br>As Christians have their peculiar states, so they have peculiar duties;but there are precepts and obedience common to all, particularly mutuallove, and contempt of the world. The youngest sincere disciple ispardoned: the communion of saints is attended with the forgiveness ofsins. Those of the longest standing in Christ's school need furtheradvice and instruction. Even fathers must be written unto, and preachedunto; none are too old to learn. But especially young men in ChristJesus, though they are arrived at strength of spirit and sound sense,and have successfully resisted first trials and temptations, breakingoff bad habits and connexions, and entered in at the strait gate oftrue conversion. The different descriptions of Christians are againaddressed. Children in Christ know that God is their Father; it iswisdom. Those advanced believers, who know Him that was from thebeginning, before this world was made, may well be led thereby to giveup this world. It will be the glory of young persons to be strong inChrist, and his grace. By the word of God they overcome the wicked one.
1Jo 2:15-17	<br>The things of the world may be desired and possessed for the uses andpurposes which God intended, and they are to be used by his grace, andto his glory; but believers must not seek or value them for thosepurposes to which sin abuses them. The world draws the heart from God;and the more the love of the world prevails, the more the love of Goddecays. The things of the world are classed according to the threeruling inclinations of depraved nature. 1. The lust of the flesh, ofthe body: wrong desires of the heart, the appetite of indulging allthings that excite and inflame sensual pleasures. 2. The lust of theeyes: the eyes are delighted with riches and rich possessions; this isthe lust of covetousness. 3. The pride of life: a vain man craves thegrandeur and pomp of a vain-glorious life; this includes thirst afterhonour and applause. The things of the world quickly fade and die away;desire itself will ere long fail and cease, but holy affection is notlike the lust that passes away. The love of God shall never fail. Manyvain efforts have been made to evade the force of this passage bylimitations, distinctions, or exceptions. Many have tried to show howfar we may be carnally-minded, and love the world; but the plainmeaning of these verses cannot easily be mistaken. Unless this victoryover the world is begun in the heart, a man has no root in himself, butwill fall away, or at most remain an unfruitful professor. Yet thesevanities are so alluring to the corruption in our hearts, that withoutconstant watching and prayer, we cannot escape the world, or obtainvictory over the god and prince of it.
1Jo 2:18-23	<br>Every man is an antichrist, who denies the Person, or any of theoffices of Christ; and in denying the Son, he denies the Father also,and has no part in his favour while he rejects his great salvation. Letthis prophecy that seducers would rise in the Christian world, keep usfrom being seduced. The church knows not well who are its true members,and who are not, but thus true Christians were proved, and renderedmore watchful and humble. True Christians are anointed ones; theirnames expresses this: they are anointed with grace, with gifts andspiritual privileges, by the Holy Spirit of grace. The great and mosthurtful lies that the father of lies spreads in the world, usually arefalsehoods and errors relating to the person of Christ. The unctionfrom the Holy One, alone can keep us from delusions. While we judgefavourably of all who trust in Christ as the Divine Saviour, and obeyhis word, and seek to live in union with them, let us pity and pray forthose who deny the Godhead of Christ, or his atonement, and thenew-creating work of the Holy Ghost. Let us protest against suchantichristian doctrine, and keep from them as much as we may.
1Jo 2:24-29	<br>The truth of Christ, abiding in us, is a means to sever from sin, andunites us to the Son of God, Joh 15:3,4. What value should we put upongospel truth! Thereby the promise of eternal life is made sure. Thepromise God makes, is suitable to his own greatness, power, andgoodness; it is eternal life. The Spirit of truth will not lie; and heteaches all things in the present dispensation, all things necessary toour knowledge of God in Christ, and their glory in the gospel. Theapostle repeats the kind words, "little children;" which denotes hisaffection. He would persuade by love. Gospel privileges oblige togospel duties; and those anointed by the Lord Jesus abide with him. Thenew spiritual nature is from the Lord Christ. He that is constant tothe practice of religion in trying times, shows that he is born fromabove, from the Lord Christ. Then, let us beware of holding the truthin unrighteousness, remembering that those only are born of God, whobear his holy image, and walk in his most righteous ways.
1Jo 3:1,2	<br>Little does the world know of the happiness of the real followers ofChrist. Little does the world think that these poor, humble, despisedones, are favourites of God, and will dwell in heaven. Let thefollowers of Christ be content with hard fare here, since they are in aland of strangers, where their Lord was so badly treated before them.The sons of God must walk by faith, and live by hope. They may wellwait in faith, hope, and earnest desire, for the revelation of the LordJesus. The sons of God will be known, and be made manifest by likenessto their Head. They shall be transformed into the same image, by theirview of him.
1Jo 3:3-10	<br>The sons of God know that their Lord is of purer eyes than to allow anything unholy and impure to dwell with him. It is the hope ofhypocrites, not of the sons of God, that makes allowance for gratifyingimpure desires and lusts. May we be followers of him as his dearchildren, thus show our sense of his unspeakable mercy, and expressthat obedient, grateful, humble mind which becomes us. Sin is therejecting the Divine law. In him, that is, in Christ, was no sin. Allthe sinless weaknesses that were consequences of the fall, he took;that is, all those infirmities of mind or body which subject man tosuffering, and expose him to temptation. But our moral infirmities, ourproneness to sin, he had not. He that abides in Christ, continues notin the practice of sin. Renouncing sin is the great proof of spiritualunion with, continuance in, and saving knowledge of the Lord Christ.Beware of self-deceit. He that doeth righteousness is righteous, and tobe a follower of Christ, shows an interest by faith in his obedienceand sufferings. But a man cannot act like the devil, and at the sametime be a disciple of Christ Jesus. Let us not serve or indulge whatthe Son of God came to destroy. To be born of God is to be inwardlyrenewed by the power of the Spirit of God. Renewing grace is an abidingprinciple. Religion is not an art, a matter of dexterity and skill, buta new nature. And the regenerate person cannot sin as he did before hewas born of God, and as others do who are not born again. There is thatlight in his mind, which shows him the evil and malignity of sin. Thereis that bias upon his heart, which disposes him to loathe and hate sin.There is the spiritual principle that opposes sinful acts. And there isrepentance for sin, if committed. It goes against him to sin withforethought. The children of God and the children of the devil havetheir distinct characters. The seed of the serpent are known by neglectof religion, and by their hating real Christians. He only is righteousbefore God, as a justified believer, who is taught and disposed torighteousness by the Holy Spirit. In this the children of God aremanifest, and the children of the devil. May all professors of thegospel lay these truths to heart, and try themselves by them.
1Jo 3:11-15	<br>We should love the Lord Jesus, value his love, and therefore love allour brethren in Christ. This love is the special fruit of our faith,and a certain sign of our being born again. But none who rightly knowthe heart of man, can wonder at the contempt and enmity of ungodlypeople against the children of God. We know that we are passed fromdeath to life: we may know it by the evidences of our faith in Christ,of which love to our brethren is one. It is not zeal for a party in thecommon religion, or affection for those who are of the same name andsentiments with ourselves. The life of grace in the heart of aregenerate person, is the beginning and first principle of a life ofglory, whereof they must be destitute who hate their brother in theirhearts.
1Jo 3:16-21	<br>Here is the condescension, the miracle, the mystery of Divine love,that God would redeem the church with his own blood. Surely we shouldlove those whom God has loved, and so loved. The Holy Spirit, grievedat selfishness, will leave the selfish heart without comfort, and fullof darkness and terror. By what can it be known that a man has a truesense of the love of Christ for perishing sinners, or that the love ofGod has been planted in his heart by the Holy Spirit, if the love ofthe world and its good overcomes the feelings of compassion to aperishing brother? Every instance of this selfishness must weaken theevidences of a man's conversion; when habitual and allowed, it mustdecide against him. If conscience condemn us in known sin, or theneglect of known duty, God does so too. Let conscience therefore bewell-informed, be heard, and diligently attended to.
1Jo 3:22-24	<br>When believers had confidence towards God, through the Spirit ofadoption, and by faith in the great High Priest, they might ask whatthey would of their reconciled Father. They would receive it, if goodfor them. And as good-will to men was proclaimed from heaven, sogood-will to men, particularly to the brethren, must be in the heartsof those who go to God and heaven. He who thus follows Christ, dwellsin Him as his ark, refuge, and rest, and in the Father through him.This union between Christ and the souls of believers, is by the Spirithe has given them. A man may believe that God is gracious before heknows it; yet when faith has laid hold on the promises, it sets reasonto work. This Spirit of God works a change; in all true Christians itchanges from the power of Satan to the power of God. Consider,believer, how it changes thy heart. Dost not thou long for peace withGod? Wouldst thou not forego all the world for it? No profit, pleasure,or preferment shall hinder thee from following Christ. This salvationis built upon Divine testimony, even the Spirit of God.
1Jo 4:1-6	<br>Christians who are well acquainted with the Scriptures, may, in humbledependence on Divine teaching, discern those who set forth doctrinesaccording to the apostles, and those who contradict them. The sum ofrevealed religion is in the doctrine concerning Christ, his person andoffice. The false teachers spake of the world according to its maximsand tastes, so as not to offend carnal men. The world approved them,they made rapid progress, and had many followers such as themselves;the world will love its own, and its own will love it. The truedoctrine as to the Saviour's person, as leading men from the world toGod, is a mark of the spirit of truth in opposition to the spirit oferror. The more pure and holy any doctrine is, the more likely to be ofGod; nor can we by any other rules try the spirits whether they are ofGod or not. And what wonder is it, that people of a worldly spiritshould cleave to those who are like themselves, and suit their schemesand discourses to their corrupt taste?
1Jo 4:7-13	<br>The Spirit of God is the Spirit of love. He that does not love theimage of God in his people, has no saving knowledge of God. For it isGod's nature to be kind, and to give happiness. The law of God is love;and all would have been perfectly happy, had all obeyed it. Theprovision of the gospel, for the forgiveness of sin, and the salvationof sinners, consistently with God's glory and justice, shows that Godis love. Mystery and darkness rest upon many things yet. God has soshown himself to be love, that we cannot come short of eternalhappiness, unless through unbelief and impenitence, although strictjustice would condemn us to hopeless misery, because we break ourCreator's laws. None of our words or thoughts can do justice to thefree, astonishing love of a holy God towards sinners, who could notprofit or harm him, whom he might justly crush in a moment, and whosedeserving of his vengeance was shown in the method by which they weresaved, though he could by his almighty Word have created other worlds,with more perfect beings, if he had seen fit. Search we the wholeuniverse for love in its most glorious displays? It is to be found inthe person and the cross of Christ. Does love exist between God andsinners? Here was the origin, not that we loved God, but that he freelyloved us. His love could not be designed to be fruitless upon us, andwhen its proper end and issue are gained and produced, it may be saidto be perfected. So faith is perfected by its works. Thus it willappear that God dwells in us by his new-creating Spirit. A lovingChristian is a perfect Christian; set him to any good duty, and he isperfect to it, he is expert at it. Love oils the wheels of hisaffections, and sets him on that which is helpful to his brethren. Aman that goes about a business with ill will, always does it badly.That God dwells in us and we in him, were words too high for mortals touse, had not God put them before us. But how may it be known whetherthe testimony to this does proceed from the Holy Ghost? Those who aretruly persuaded that they are the sons of God, cannot but call himAbba, Father. From love to him, they hate sin, and whatever disagreeswith his will, and they have a sound and hearty desire to do his will.Such testimony is the testimony of the Holy Ghost.
1Jo 4:14-21	<br>The Father sent the Son, he willed his coming into this world. Theapostle attests this. And whosoever shall confess that Jesus is the Sonof God, God dwelleth in him, and he in God. This confession includesfaith in the heart as the foundation; makes acknowledgment with themouth to the glory of God and Christ, and profession in the life andconduct, against the flatteries and frowns of the world. There must bea day of universal judgment. Happy those who shall have holy boldnessbefore the Judge at that day; knowing he is their Friend and Advocate!Happy those who have holy boldness in the prospect of that day, wholook and wait for it, and for the Judge's appearance! True love to Godassures believers of God's love to them. Love teaches us to suffer forhim and with him; therefore we may trust that we shall also beglorified with him, 2Ti 2:12. We must distinguish between the fear ofGod and being afraid of him; the fear of God imports high regard andveneration for God. Obedience and good works, done from the principleof love, are not like the servile toil of one who unwillingly laboursfrom dread of a master's anger. They are like that of a dutiful child,who does services to a beloved father, which benefit his brethren, andare done willingly. It is a sign that our love is far from perfect,when our doubts, fears, and apprehensions of God, are many. Let heavenand earth stand amazed at his love. He sent his word to invite sinnersto partake of this great salvation. Let them take the comfort of thehappy change wrought in them, while they give him the glory. The loveof God in Christ, in the hearts of Christians from the Spirit ofadoption, is the great proof of conversion. This must be tried by itseffects on their temper, and their conduct to their brethren. If a manprofesses to love God, and yet indulges anger or revenge, or shows aselfish disposition, he gives his profession the lie. But if it isplain that our natural enmity is changed into affection and gratitude,let us bless the name of our God for this seal and earnest of eternalhappiness. Then we differ from the false professors, who pretend tolove God, whom they have not seen, yet hate their brethren, whom theyhave seen.
1Jo 5:1-5	<br>True love for the people of God, may be distinguished from naturalkindness or party attachments, by its being united with the love ofGod, and obedience to his commands. The same Holy Spirit that taughtthe love, will have taught obedience also; and that man cannot trulylove the children of God, who, by habit, commits sin or neglects knownduty. As God's commands are holy, just, and good rules of liberty andhappiness, so those who are born of God and love him, do not count themgrievous, but lament that they cannot serve him more perfectly.Self-denial is required, but true Christians have a principle whichcarries them above all hinderances. Though the conflict often is sharp,and the regenerate may be cast down, yet he will rise up and renew hiscombat with resolution. But all, except believers in Christ, areenslaved in some respect or other, to the customs, opinions, orinterests of the world. Faith is the cause of victory, the means, theinstrument, the spiritual armour by which we overcome. In and by faithwe cleave to Christ, in contempt of, and in opposition to the world.Faith sanctifies the heart, and purifies it from those sensual lusts bywhich the world obtains sway and dominion over souls. It has theindwelling Spirit of grace, which is greater than he who dwells in theworld. The real Christian overcomes the world by faith; he sees, in andby the life and conduct of the Lord Jesus on earth, that this world isto be renounced and overcome. He cannot be satisfied with this world,but looks beyond it, and is still tending, striving, and pressingtoward heaven. We must all, after Christ's example, overcome the world,or it will overcome us to our ruin.
1Jo 5:6-8	<br>We are inwardly and outwardly defiled; inwardly, by the power andpollution of sin in our nature. For our cleansing there is in and byChrist Jesus, the washing of regeneration and the renewing of the HolyGhost. Some think that the two sacraments are here meant: baptism withwater, as the outward sign of regeneration, and purifying from thepollution of sin by the Holy Spirit; and the Lord's supper, as theoutward sign of the shedding Christ's blood, and the receiving him byfaith for pardon and justification. Both these ways of cleansing wererepresented in the old ceremonial sacrifices and cleansings. This waterand blood include all that is necessary to our salvation. By the water,our souls are washed and purified for heaven and the habitation ofsaints in light. By the blood, we are justified, reconciled, andpresented righteous to God. By the blood, the curse of the law beingsatisfied, the purifying Spirit is obtained for the internal cleansingof our natures. The water, as well as the blood, came out of the sideof the sacrificed Redeemer. He loved the church, and gave himself forit, that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water bythe word; that he might present it to himself a glorious church, Eph5:25-27. This was done in and by the Spirit of God, according to theSaviour's declaration. He is the Spirit of God, and cannot lie. Threehad borne witness to these doctrines concerning the person and thesalvation of Christ. The Father, repeatedly, by a voice from heavendeclared that Jesus was his beloved Son. The Word declared that He andthe Father were One, and that whoever had seen him had seen the Father.And the Holy Ghost, who descended from heaven and rested on Christ athis baptism; who had borne witness to Him by all the prophets; and gavetestimony to his resurrection and mediatorial office, by the gift ofmiraculous powers to the apostles. But whether this passage be cited ornot, the doctrine of the Trinity in Unity stands equally firm andcertain. To the doctrine taught by the apostles, respecting the personand salvation of Christ, there were three testimonies. 1. The HolySpirit. We come into the world with a corrupt, carnal disposition,which is enmity to God. This being done away by the regeneration andnew-creating of souls by the Holy Spirit, is a testimony to theSaviour. 2. The water: this sets forth the Saviour's purity andpurifying power. The actual and active purity and holiness of hisdisciples are represented by baptism. 3. The blood which he shed: andthis was our ransom, this testifies for Jesus Christ; it sealed up andfinished the sacrifices of the Old Testament. The benefits procured byhis blood, prove that he is the Saviour of the world. No wonder if hethat rejects this evidence is judged a blasphemer of the Spirit of God.These three witnesses are for one and the same purpose; they agree inone and the same thing.
1Jo 5:9-12	<br>Nothing can be more absurd than the conduct of those who doubt as tothe truth of Christianity, while in the common affairs of life they donot hesitate to proceed on human testimony, and would deem any one outof his senses who declined to do so. The real Christian has seen hisguilt and misery, and his need of such a Saviour. He has seen thesuitableness of such a Saviour to all his spiritual wants andcircumstances. He has found and felt the power of the word and doctrineof Christ, humbling, healing, quickening, and comforting his soul. Hehas a new disposition, and new delights, and is not the man that heformerly was. Yet he finds still a conflict with himself, with sin,with the flesh, the world, and wicked powers. But he finds suchstrength from faith in Christ, that he can overcome the world, andtravel on towards a better. Such assurance has the gospel believer: hehas a witness in himself, which puts the matter out of doubt with him,except in hours of darkness or conflict; but he cannot be argued out ofhis belief in the leading truths of the gospel. Here is what makes theunbeliever's sin so awful; the sin of unbelief. He gives God the lie;because he believes not the record that God gave of his Son. It is invain for a man to plead that he believes the testimony of God in otherthings, while he rejects it in this. He that refuses to trust andhonour Christ as the Son of God, who disdains to submit to his teachingas Prophet, to rely on his atonement and intercession as High Priest,or to obey him as King, is dead in sin, under condemnation; nor willany outward morality, learning, forms, notions, or confidences availhim.
1Jo 5:13-17	<br>Upon all this evidence, it is but right that we believe on the name ofthe Son of God. Believers have eternal life in the covenant of thegospel. Then let us thankfully receive the record of Scripture. Alwaysabounding in the work of the Lord, knowing that our labour is not invain in the Lord. The Lord Christ invites us to come to him in allcircumstances, with our supplications and requests, notwithstanding thesin that besets us. Our prayers must always be offered in submission tothe will of God. In some things they are speedily answered; in othersthey are granted in the best manner, though not as requested. We oughtto pray for others, as well as for ourselves. There are sins that waragainst spiritual life in the soul, and the life above. We cannot praythat the sins of the impenitent and unbelieving should, while they aresuch, be forgiven them; or that mercy, which supposes the forgivenessof sins, should be granted to them, while they wilfully continue such.But we may pray for their repentance, for their being enriched withfaith in Christ, and thereupon for all other saving mercies. We shouldpray for others, as well as for ourselves, beseeching the Lord topardon and recover the fallen, as well as to relieve the tempted andafflicted. And let us be truly thankful that no sin, of which any onetruly repents, is unto death.
1Jo 5:18-21	<br>All mankind are divided into two parties or dominions; that whichbelongs to God, and that which belongs to the wicked one. Truebelievers belong to God: they are of God, and from him, and to him, andfor him; while the rest, by far the greater number, are in the power ofthe wicked one; they do his works, and support his cause. This generaldeclaration includes all unbelievers, whatever their profession,station, or situation, or by whatever name they may be called. The Sonleads believers to the Father, and they are in the love and favour ofboth; in union with both, by the indwelling and working of the HolySpirit. Happy are those to whom it is given to know that the Son of Godis come, and to have a heart to trust in and rely on him that is true!May this be our privilege; we shall thus be kept from all idols andfalse doctrines, and from the idolatrous love of worldly objects, andbe kept by the power of God, through faith, unto eternal salvation. Tothis living and true God, be glory and dominion for ever and ever.Amen.
2Jo 1:1-3	<br>Religion turns compliments into real expressions of respect and love.And old disciple is honourable; an old apostle and leader of disciplesis more so. The letter is to a noble Christian matron, and herchildren; it is well that the gospel should get among such: some noblepersons are called. Families are to be encouraged and directed in theirlove and duties at home. Those who love truth and piety in themselves,should love it in others; and the Christians loved this lady, not forher rank, but for her holiness. And where religion truly dwells, itwill abide for ever. From the Divine Persons of the Godhead, theapostle craves grace, Divine favour, and good-will, the spring of allgood things. It is grace indeed that any spiritual blessing should begiven to sinful mortals. Mercy, free pardon, and forgiveness; for thosealready rich in grace, need continual forgiveness. Peace, quietness ofspirit, and a clear conscience, in assured reconciliation with God,together with all outward prosperity that is really for good: these aredesired in truth and love.
2Jo 1:4-6	<br>It is good to be trained to early religion; and children may be belovedfor their parents' sake. It gave great joy to the apostle to seechildren treading in their parents' steps, and likely in their turn tosupport the gospel. May God bless such families more and more, andraise up many to copy their example. How pleasing the contrast tonumbers who spread irreligion, infidelity, and vice, among theirchildren! Our walk is true, our converse right, when according to theword of God. This commandment of mutual Christian love, may be said tobe a new one, in respect of its being declared by the Lord Christ; yet,as to the matter, it is old. And this is love to our own souls, that weobey the Divine commands. The foresight of the decay of this love, aswell as of other apostacies, or fallings away, might engage the apostleto urge this duty, and this command, frequently and earnestly.
2Jo 1:7-11	<br>The deceiver and his deceit are described: he brings some errorconcerning the person or office of the Lord Jesus. Such a one is adeceiver and an antichrist; he deludes souls, and undermines the gloryand kingdom of the Lord Christ. Let us not think it strange, that thereare deceivers and opposers of the Lord Christ's name and dignity now,for there were such, even in the apostles' times. The more deceiversand deceits abound, the more watchful the disciples must be. Sad it is,that splendid attainments in the school of Christ, should ever be lost.The way to gain the full reward is, to abide true to Christ, andconstant in religion to the end. Firm cleaving to Christian truthunites us to Christ, and thereby to the Father also; for they are one.Let us equally disregard such as abide not in the doctrine of Christ,and those who transgress his commands. Any who did not profess andpreach the doctrine of Christ, respecting him as the Son of God, andsalvation by him from guilt and sin, were not to be noticed andcountenanced. Yet in obeying this command, we must show kindness and agood spirit to those who differ from us in lesser matters, but holdfirmly the all-important doctrines of Christ's person, atonement, andholy salvation.
2Jo 1:12,13	<br>The apostle refers many things to a personal meeting. Pen and ink weremeans of strengthening and comforting others; but to see each other ismore so. The communion of saints should be maintained by all methods;and should tend to mutual joy. In communion with them we find much ofour present joy, and look forward to happiness for ever.
3Jo 1:1-8	<br>Those who are beloved of Christ, will love the brethren for his sake.Soul prosperity is the greatest blessing on this side heaven. Grace andhealth are rich companions. Grace will employ health. A rich soul maybe lodged in a weak body; and grace must then be exercised insubmitting to such a dispensation. But we may wish and pray that thosewho have prosperous souls, may have healthful bodies; that their gracemay shine where there is still more room for activity. How manyprofessors there are, about whom the apostle's words must be reversed,and we must earnestly wish and pray that their souls might prosper, astheir health and circumstances do! True faith will work by love. A goodreport is due from those who receive good; they could not but testifyto the church, what they found and felt. Good men will rejoice in thesoul prosperity of others; and they are glad to hear of the grace andgoodness of others. And as it is a joy to good parents, it will be ajoy to good ministers, to see their people adorn their profession.Gaius overlooked petty differences among serious Christians, and freelyhelped all who bore the image, and did the work of Christ. He wasupright in what he did, as a faithful servant. Faithful souls can heartheir own praises without being puffed up; the commendation of what isgood in them, lays them at the foot of the cross of Christ. Christiansshould consider not only what they must do, but what they may do; andshould do even the common actions of life, and of good-will, after agodly sort, serving God therein, and designing his glory. Those whofreely make known Christ's gospel, should be helped by others to whomGod gives the means. Those who cannot themselves proclaim it, may yetreceive, help, and countenance those who do so.
3Jo 1:9-12	<br>Both the heart and mouth must be watched. The temper and spirit ofDiotrephes was full of pride and ambition. It is bad not to do goodourselves; but it is worse to hinder those who would do good. Thosecautions and counsels are most likely to be accepted, which areseasoned with love. Follow that which is good, for he that doeth good,as delighting therein, is born of God. Evil-workers vainly pretend orboast acquaintance with God. Let us not follow that which is proud,selfish, and of bad design, though the example may be given by personsof rank and power; but let us be followers of God, and walk in love,after the example of our Lord.
3Jo 1:13,14	<br>Here is the character of Demetrius. A name in the gospel, or a goodreport in the churches, is better than worldly honour. Few are wellspoken of by all; and sometimes it is ill to be so. Happy those whosespirit and conduct commend them before God and men. We must be ready tobear our testimony to them; and it is well when those who commend, canappeal to the consciences of such as know most of those who arecommended. A personal conversation together often spares time andtrouble, and mistakes which rise from letters; and good Christians maywell be glad to see one another. The blessing is, Peace be to you; allhappiness attend you. Those may well salute and greet one another onearth, who hope to live together in heaven. By associating with andcopying the example of such Christians, we shall have peace within, andlive at peace with the brethren; our communications with the Lord'speople on earth will be pleasing, and we shall be numbered with them inglory everlasting.
Jud 1:1-4	<br>Christians are called out of the world, from the evil spirit and temperof it; called above the world, to higher and better things, to heaven,things unseen and eternal; called from sin to Christ, from vanity toseriousness, from uncleanness to holiness; and this according to theDivine purpose and grace. If sanctified and glorified, all the honourand glory must be ascribed to God, and to him alone. As it is God whobegins the work of grace in the souls of men, so it is he who carriesit on, and perfects it. Let us not trust in ourselves, nor in our stockof grace already received, but in him, and in him alone. The mercy ofGod is the spring and fountain of all the good we have or hope for;mercy, not only to the miserable, but to the guilty. Next to mercy ispeace, which we have from the sense of having obtained mercy. Frompeace springs love; Christ's love to us, our love to him, and ourbrotherly love to one another. The apostle prays, not that Christiansmay be content with a little; but that their souls and societies may befull of these things. None are shut out from gospel offers andinvitations, but those who obstinately and wickedly shut themselvesout. But the application is to all believers, and only to such. It isto the weak as well as to the strong. Those who have received thedoctrine of this common salvation, must contend for it, earnestly, notfuriously. Lying for the truth is bad; scolding for it is not better.Those who have received the truth must contend for it, as the apostlesdid; by suffering with patience and courage for it, not by makingothers suffer if they will not embrace every notion we call faith, orimportant. We ought to contend earnestly for the faith, in oppositionto those who would corrupt or deprave it; who creep in unawares; whoglide in like serpents. And those are the worst of the ungodly, whotake encouragement to sin boldly, because the grace of God hasabounded, and still abounds so wonderfully, and who are hardened by theextent and fulness of gospel grace, the design of which is to delivermen from sin, and bring them unto God.
Jud 1:5-7	<br>Outward privileges, profession, and apparent conversion, could notsecure those from the vengeance of God, who turned aside in unbeliefand disobedience. The destruction of the unbelieving Israelites in thewilderness, shows that none ought to presume on their privileges. Theyhad miracles as their daily bread; yet even they perished in unbelief.A great number of the angels were not pleased with the stations Godallotted to them; pride was the main and direct cause or occasion oftheir fall. The fallen angels are kept to the judgment of the greatday; and shall fallen men escape it? Surely not. Consider this in duetime. The destruction of Sodom is a loud warning to all, to take heedof, and flee from fleshly lusts that war against the soul, 1Pe 2:11.God is the same holy, just, pure Being now, as then. Stand in awe,therefore, and sin not, Ps 4:4. Let us not rest in anything that doesnot make the soul subject to the obedience of Christ; for nothing butthe renewal of our souls to the Divine image by the Holy Spirit, cankeep us from being destroyed among the enemies of God. Consider thisinstance of the angels, and see that no dignity or worth of thecreature is of avail. How then should man tremble, who drinkethiniquity like water! Job 15:16.
Jud 1:8-16	<br>False teachers are dreamers; they greatly defile and grievously woundthe soul. These teachers are of a disturbed mind and a seditiousspirit; forgetting that the powers that be, are ordained of God, Ro13:1. As to the contest about the body of Moses, it appears that Satanwished to make the place of his burial known to the Israelites, inorder to tempt them to worship him, but he was prevented, and ventedhis rage in desperate blasphemy. This should remind all who disputenever to bring railing charges. Also learn hence, that we ought todefend those whom God owns. It is hard, if not impossible, to find anyenemies to the Christian religion, who did not, and do not, live inopen or secret contradiction to the principles of natural religion.Such are here compared to brute beasts, though they often boast ofthemselves as the wisest of mankind. They corrupt themselves in thethings most open and plain. The fault lies, not in theirunderstandings, but in their depraved wills, and their disorderedappetites and affections. It is a great reproach, though unjust toreligion, when those who profess it are opposed to it in heart andlife. The Lord will remedy this in his time and way; not in men's blindway of plucking up the wheat with the tares. It is sad when men beginin the Spirit, and end in the flesh. Twice dead; they had been oncedead in their natural, fallen state; but now they are dead again by theevident proofs of their hypocrisy. Dead trees, why cumber they theground! Away with them to the fire. Raging waves are a terror tosailing passengers; but when they get into port, the noise and terrorare ended. False teachers are to expect the worst punishments in thisworld and in that to come. They glare like meteors, or falling stars,and then sink into the blackness of darkness for ever. We have nomention of the prophecy of Enoch in any other part or place ofScripture; yet one plain text of Scripture, proves any point we are tobelieve. We find from this, that Christ's coming to judge wasprophesied of, as early as the times before the flood. The Lord cometh:what a glorious time will that be! Notice how often the word "ungodly"is repeated. Many now do not at all refer to the terms godly, orungodly, unless it be to mock at even the words; but it is not so inthe language taught us by the Holy Ghost. Hard speeches of one another,especially if ill-grounded, will certainly come into account at the dayof judgment. These evil men and seducers are angry at every thing thathappens, and never pleased with their own state and condition. Theirwill and their fancy, are their only rule and law. Those who pleasetheir sinful appetites, are most prone to yield to ungovernablepassions. The men of God, from the beginning of the world, havedeclared the doom denounced on them. Such let us avoid. We are tofollow men only as they follow Christ. (Jud 1:17-23)
Jud 1:17-23	<br>Sensual men separate from Christ, and his church, and join themselvesto the devil, the world, and the flesh, by ungodly and sinfulpractices. That is infinitely worse than to separate from any branch ofthe visible church on account of opinions, or modes and circumstancesof outward government or worship. Sensual men have not the spirit ofholiness, which whoever has not, does not belong to Christ. The graceof faith is most holy, as it works by love, purifies the heart, andovercomes the world, by which it is distinguished from a false and deadfaith. Our prayers are most likely to prevail, when we pray in the HolyGhost, under his guidance and influence, according to the rule of hisword, with faith, fervency, and earnestness; this is praying in theHoly Ghost. And a believing expectation of eternal life will arm usagainst the snares of sin: lively faith in this blessed hope will helpus to mortify our lusts. We must watch over one another; faithfully,yet prudently reprove each other, and set a good example to all aboutus. This must be done with compassion, making a difference between theweak and the wilful. Some we must treat with tenderness. Others savewith fear; urging the terrors of the Lord. All endeavours must bejoined with decided abhorrence of crimes, and care be taken to avoidwhatever led to, or was connected with fellowship with them, in worksof darkness, keeping far from what is, or appears to be evil.
Jud 1:24,25	<br>God is able, and as willing as able, to keep us from falling, and topresent us faultless before the presence of his glory. Not as those whonever have been faulty, but as those who, but for God's mercy, and aSaviour's sufferings and merits, might most justly have been condemnedlong ago. All sincere believers were given him of the Father; and ofall so given him he has lost none, nor will lose any one. Now, ourfaults fill us with fears, doubts, and sorrows; but the Redeemer hasundertaken for his people, that they shall be presented faultless.Where there is no sin, there will be no sorrow; where there is theperfection of holiness, there will be the perfection of joy. Let usmore often look up to Him who is able to keep us from falling, toimprove as well as maintain the work he has wrought in us, till weshall be presented blameless before the presence of his glory. Thenshall our hearts know a joy beyond what earth can afford; then shallGod also rejoice over us, and the joy of our compassionate Saviour becompleted. To Him who has so wisely formed the scheme, and willfaithfully and perfectly accomplish it, be glory and majesty, dominionand power, both now and for ever. Amen.
Rev 1:1-3	<br>This book is the Revelation of Jesus Christ; the whole Bible is so; forall revelation comes through Christ, and all relates to him. Itsprincipal subject is to discover the purposes of God concerning theaffairs of the church, and of the nations as connected therewith, tothe end of the world. These events would surely come to pass; and theywould begin to come to pass very shortly. Though Christ is himself God,and has light and life in himself, yet, as Mediator between God andman, he receives instructions from the Father. To him we owe theknowledge of what we are to expect from God, and what he expects fromus. The subject of this revelation was, the things that must shortlycome to pass. On all who read or hear the words of the prophecy, ablessing is pronounced. Those are well employed who search the Bible.It is not enough that we read and hear, but we must keep the thingsthat are written, in our memories, in our minds, in our affections, andin practice, and we shall be blessed in the deed. Even the mysteriesand difficulties of this book are united with discoveries of God,suited to impress the mind with awe, and to purify the soul of thereader, though he may not discern the prophetic meaning. No part ofScripture more fully states the gospel, and warns against the evil ofsin.
Rev 1:4-8	<br>There can be no true peace, where there is not true grace; and wheregrace goeth before, peace will follow. This blessing is in the name ofGod, of the Holy Trinity, it is an act of adoration. The Father isfirst named; he is described as the Jehovah who is, and who was, andwho is to come, eternal, unchangeable. The Holy Spirit is called theseven spirits, the perfect Spirit of God, in whom there is a diversityof gifts and operations. The Lord Jesus Christ was from eternity, aWitness to all the counsels of God. He is the First-born from the dead,who will by his own power raise up his people. He is the Prince of thekings of the earth; by him their counsels are overruled, and to himthey are accountable. Sin leaves a stain of guilt and pollution uponthe soul. Nothing can fetch out this stain but the blood of Christ; andChrist shed his own blood to satisfy Divine justice, and purchasepardon and purity for his people. Christ has made believers kings andpriests to God and his Father. As such they overcome the world, mortifysin, govern their own spirits, resist Satan, prevail with God inprayer, and shall judge the world. He has made them priests, given themaccess to God, enabled them to offer spiritual and acceptablesacrifices, and for these favours they are bound to ascribe to himdominion and glory for ever. He will judge the world. Attention iscalled to that great day when all will see the wisdom and happiness ofthe friends of Christ, and the madness and misery of his enemies. Letus think frequently upon the second coming of Christ. He shall come, tothe terror of those who wound and crucify him by apostacy: he shallcome, to the astonishment of the whole world of the ungodly. He is theBeginning and the End; all things are from him and for him; he is theAlmighty; the same eternal and unchanged One. And if we would benumbered with his saints in glory everlasting, we must now willingsubmit to him receive him, and honour him as a saviour, who we believewill come to be our Judge. Alas, that there should be many, who wouldwish never to die, and that there should not be a day of judgment!
Rev 1:9-11	<br>It was the apostle's comfort that he did not suffer as an evil-doer,but for the testimony of Jesus, for bearing witness to Christ as theImmanuel, the Saviour; and the Spirit of glory and of God rested uponthis persecuted apostle. The day and time when he had this vision wasthe Lord's day, the Christian sabbath, the first day of the week,observed in remembrance of the resurrection of Christ. Let us who callhim "Our Lord," honour him on his own day. The name shows how thissacred day should be observed; the Lord's day should be wholly devotedto the Lord, and none of its hours employed in a sensual, worldlymanner, or in amusements. He was in a serious, heavenly, spiritualframe, under the gracious influences of the Spirit of God. Those whowould enjoy communion with God on the Lord's day, must seek to drawtheir thoughts and affections from earthly things. And if believers arekept on the Lord's holy day, from public ordinances and the communionof saints, by necessity and not by choice, they may look for comfort inmeditation and secret duties, from the influences of the Spirit; and byhearing the voice and contemplating the glory of their beloved Saviour,from whose gracious words and power no confinement or outwardcircumstances can separate them. An alarm was given as with the soundof the trumpet, and then the apostle heard the voice of Christ.
Rev 1:12-20	<br>The churches receive their light from Christ and the gospel, and holdit forth to others. They are golden candlesticks; they should beprecious and pure; not only the ministers, but the members of thechurches; their light should so shine before men, as to engage othersto give glory to God. And the apostle saw as though of the Lord JesusChrist appeared in the midst of the golden candlesticks. He is with hischurches always, to the end of the world, filling them with light, andlife, and love. He was clothed with a robe down to the feet, perhapsrepresenting his righteousness and priesthood, as Mediator. This vestwas girt with a golden girdle, which may denote how precious are hislove and affection for his people. His head and hairs white like wooland as snow, may signify his majesty, purity, and eternity. His eyes asa flame of fire, may represent his knowledge of the secrets of allhearts, and of the most distant events. His feet like fine brassburning in a furnace, may denote the firmness of his appointments, andthe excellence of his proceedings. His voice as the sound of manywaters, may represent the power of his word, to remove or to destroy.The seven stars were emblems of the ministers of the seven churches towhich the apostle was ordered to write, and whom Christ upheld anddirected. The sword represented his justice, and his word, piercing tothe dividing asunder of soul and spirit, Heb 4:12. His countenance waslike the sun, when it shines clearly and powerfully; its strength toobright and dazzling for mortal eyes to behold. The apostle wasoverpowered with the greatness of the lustre and glory in which Christappeared. We may well be contented to walk by faith, while here uponearth. The Lord Jesus spake words of comfort; Fear not. Words ofinstruction; telling who thus appeared. And his Divine nature; theFirst and the Last. His former sufferings; I was dead: the very samewhom his disciples saw upon the cross. His resurrection and life; Ihave conquered death, and am partaker of endless life. His office andauthority; sovereign dominion in and over the invisible world, as theJudge of all, from whose sentence there is no appeal. Let us listen tothe voice of Christ, and receive the tokens of his love, for what canhe withhold from those for whose sins he has died? May we then obey hisword, and give up ourselves wholly to him who directs all thingsaright.
Rev 2:1-7	<br>These churches were in such different states as to purity of doctrineand the power of godliness, that the words of Christ to them willalways suit the cases of other churches, and professors. Christ knowsand observes their state; though in heaven, yet he walks in the midstof his churches on earth, observing what is wrong in them, and whatthey want. The church of Ephesus is commended for diligence in duty.Christ keeps an account of every hour's work his servants do for him,and their labour shall not be in vain in the Lord. But it is not enoughthat we are diligent; there must be bearing patience, and there must bewaiting patience. And though we must show all meekness to all men, yetwe must show just zeal against their sins. The sin Christ charged thischurch with, is, not the having left and forsaken the object of love,but having lost the fervent degree of it that at first appeared. Christis displeased with his people, when he sees them grow remiss and coldtoward him. Surely this mention in Scripture, of Christians forsakingtheir first love, reproves those who speak of it with carelessness, andthus try to excuse indifference and sloth in themselves and others; ourSaviour considers this indifference as sinful. They must repent: theymust be grieved and ashamed for their sinful declining, and humblyconfess it in the sight of God. They must endeavour to recover theirfirst zeal, tenderness, and seriousness, and must pray as earnestly,and watch as diligently, as when they first set out in the ways of God.If the presence of Christ's grace and Spirit is slighted, we may expectthe presence of his displeasure. Encouraging mention is made of whatwas good among them. Indifference as to truth and error, good and evil,may be called charity and meekness, but it is not so; and it isdispleasing to Christ. The Christian life is a warfare against sin,Satan, the world, and the flesh. We must never yield to our spiritualenemies, and then we shall have a glorious triumph and reward. All whopersevere, shall derive from Christ, as the Tree of life, perfectionand confirmation in holiness and happiness, not in the earthlyparadise, but in the heavenly. This is a figurative expression, takenfrom the account of the garden of Eden, denoting the pure,satisfactory, and eternal joys of heaven; and the looking forward tothem in this world, by faith, communion with Christ, and theconsolations of the Holy Spirit. Believers, take your wrestling lifehere, and expect and look for a quiet life hereafter; but not tillthen: the word of God never promises quietness and complete freedomfrom conflict here.
Rev 2:8-11	<br>Our Lord Jesus is the First, for by him were all things made; he wasbefore all things, with God, and is God himself. He is the Last, for hewill be the Judge of all. As this First and Last, who was dead and isalive, is the believer's Brother and Friend, he must be rich in thedeepest poverty, honourable amidst the lowest abasement, and happyunder the heaviest tribulation, like the church of Smyrna. Many who arerich as to this world, are poor as to the next; and some who are pooroutwardly, are inwardly rich; rich in faith, in good works, rich inprivileges, rich in gifts, rich in hope. Where there is spiritualplenty, outward poverty may be well borne; and when God's people aremade poor as to this life, for the sake of Christ and a goodconscience, he makes all up to them in spiritual riches. Christ armsagainst coming troubles. Fear none of these things; not only forbidslavish fear, but subdue it, furnishing the soul with strength andcourage. It should be to try them, not to destroy them. Observe, thesureness of the reward; "I will give thee:" they shall have the rewardfrom Christ's own hand. Also, how suitable it is; "a crown of life:"the life worn out in his service, or laid down in his cause, shall berewarded with a much better life, which shall be eternal. The seconddeath is unspeakably worse than the first death, both in the agonies ofit, and as it is eternal death: it is indeed awful to die, and to bealways dying. If a man is kept from the second death and wrath to come,he may patiently endure whatever he meets with in this world.
Rev 2:12-17	<br>The word of God is a sword, able to slay both sin and sinners. It turnsand cuts every way; but the believer need not fear this sword; yet thisconfidence cannot be supported without steady obedience. As our Lordnotices all the advantages and opportunities we have for duty in theplaces where we dwell, so he notices our temptations anddiscouragements from the same causes. In a situation of trials, thechurch of Pergamos had not denied the faith, either by open apostacy,or by giving way so as to avoid the cross. Christ commends theirstedfastness, but reproves their sinful failures. A wrong view ofgospel doctrine and Christian liberty, was a root of bitterness fromwhich evil practices grew. Repentance is the duty of churches andbodies of men, as well as of particular persons; those who sintogether, should repent together. Here is the promise of favour tothose that overcome. The influences and comforts of the Spirit ofChrist, come down from heaven into the soul, for its support. This ishidden from the rest of the world. The new name is the name ofadoption; when the Holy Spirit shows his own work in the believer'ssoul, this new name and its real import are understood by him.
Rev 2:18-29	<br>Even when the Lord knows the works of his people to be wrought in love,faith, zeal, and patience; yet if his eyes, which are as a flame offire, observe them committing or allowing what is evil, he will rebuke,correct, or punish them. Here is praise of the ministry and people ofThyatira, by One who knew the principles from which they acted. Theygrew wiser and better. All Christians should earnestly desire thattheir last works may be their best works. Yet this church connived atsome wicked seducers. God is known by the judgments he executes; and bythis upon seducers, he shows his certain knowledge of the hearts ofmen, of their principles, designs, frame, and temper. Encouragement isgiven to those who kept themselves pure and undefiled. It is dangerousto despise the mystery of God, and as dangerous to receive themysteries of Satan. Let us beware of the depths of Satan, of whichthose who know the least are the most happy. How tender Christ is ofhis faithful servants! He lays nothing upon his servants but what isfor their good. There is promise of an ample reward to the persevering,victorious believer; also knowledge and wisdom, suitable to their powerand dominion. Christ brings day with him into the soul, the light ofgrace and of glory, in the presence and enjoyment of him their Lord andSaviour. After every victory let us follow up our advantage against theenemy, that we may overcome and keep the works of Christ to the end.
Rev 3:1-6	<br>The Lord Jesus is He that hath the Holy Spirit with all his powers,graces, and operations. Hypocrisy, and lamentable decay in religion,are sins charged upon Sardis, by One who knew that church well, and allher works. Outward things appeared well to men, but there was only theform of godliness, not the power; a name to live, not a principle oflife. There was great deadness in their souls, and in their services;numbers were wholly hypocrites, others were in a disordered andlifeless state. Our Lord called upon them to be watchful against theirenemies, and to be active and earnest in their duties; and toendeavour, in dependence on the grace of the Holy Spirit, to revive andstrengthen the faith and spiritual affections of those yet alive toGod, though in a declining state. Whenever we are off our watch, welose ground. Thy works are hollow and empty; prayers are not filled upwith holy desires, alms-deeds not filled up with true charity, sabbathsnot filled up with suitable devotion of soul to God. There are notinward affections suitable to outward acts and expressions; when thespirit is wanting, the form cannot long remain. In seeking a revival inour own souls, or the souls of others, it is needful to compare what weprofess with the manner in which we go on, that we may be humbled andquickened to hold fast that which remains. Christ enforces his counselwith a dreadful threatening if it should be despised. Yet our blessedLord does not leave this sinful people without some encouragement. Hemakes honourable mention of the faithful remnant in Sardis, he makes agracious promise to them. He that overcometh shall be clothed in whiteraiment; the purity of grace shall be rewarded with the perfect purityof glory. Christ has his book of life, a register of all who shallinherit eternal life; the book of remembrance of all who live to God,and keep up the life and power of godliness in evil times. Christ willbring forward this book of life, and show the names of the faithful,before God, and all the angels, at the great day.
Rev 3:7-13	<br>The same Lord Jesus has the key of government and authority in and overthe church. He opens a door of opportunity to his churches; he opens adoor of utterance to his ministers; he opens a door of entrance, opensthe heart. He shuts the door of heaven against the foolish, who sleepaway their day of grace; and against the workers of iniquity, how vainand confident soever they may be. The church in Philadelphia iscommended; yet with a gentle reproof. Although Christ accepts a littlestrength, yet believers must not rest satisfied in a little, but striveto grow in grace, to be strong in faith, giving glory to God. Christcan discover this his favour to his people, so that their enemies shallbe forced to acknowledge it. This, by the grace of Christ, will softentheir enemies, and make them desire to be admitted into communion withhis people. Christ promises preserving grace in the most trying times,as the reward of past faithfulness; To him that hath shall be given.Those who keep the gospel in a time of peace, shall be kept by Christin an hour of temptation; and the same Divine grace that has made themfruitful in times of peace, will make them faithful in times ofpersecution. Christ promises a glorious reward to the victoriousbeliever. He shall be a monumental pillar in the temple of God; amonument of the free and powerful grace of God; a monument that shallnever be defaced or removed. On this pillar shall be written the newname of Christ; by this will appear, under whom the believer fought thegood fight, and came off victorious.
Rev 3:14-22	<br>Laodicea was the last and worst of the seven churches of Asia. Here ourLord Jesus styles himself, "The Amen;" one steady and unchangeable inall his purposes and promises. If religion is worth anything, it isworth every thing. Christ expects men should be in earnest. How manyprofessors of gospel doctrine are neither hot nor cold; except as theyare indifferent in needful matters, and hot and fiery in disputes aboutthings of lesser moment! A severe punishment is threatened. They wouldgive a false opinion of Christianity, as if it were an unholy religion;while others would conclude it could afford no real satisfaction,otherwise its professors would not have been heartless in it, or soready to seek pleasure or happiness from the world. One cause of thisindifference and inconsistency in religion is, self-conceit andself-delusion; "Because thou sayest." What a difference between theirthoughts of themselves, and the thoughts Christ had of them! Howcareful should we be not to cheat our owns souls! There are many inhell, who once thought themselves far in the way to heaven. Let us begof God that we may not be left to flatter and deceive ourselves.Professors grow proud, as they become carnal and formal. Their statewas wretched in itself. They were poor; really poor, when they said andthought they were rich. They could not see their state, nor their way,nor their danger, yet they thought they saw it. They had not thegarment of justification, nor sanctification: they were exposed to sinand shame; their rags that would defile them. They were naked, withouthouse or harbour, for they were without God, in whom alone the soul ofman can find rest and safety. Good counsel was given by Christ to thissinful people. Happy those who take his counsel, for all others mustperish in their sins. Christ lets them know where they might have trueriches, and how they might have them. Some things must be parted with,but nothing valuable; and it is only to make room for receiving trueriches. Part with sin and self-confidence, that you may be filled withhis hidden treasure. They must receive from Christ the white raiment hepurchased and provided for them; his own imputed righteousness forjustification, and the garments of holiness and sanctification. Letthem give themselves up to his word and Spirit, and their eyes shall beopened to see their way and their end. Let us examine ourselves by therule of his word, and pray earnestly for the teaching of his HolySpirit, to take away our pride, prejudices, and worldly lusts. Sinnersought to take the rebukes of God's word and rod, as tokens of his loveto their souls. Christ stood without; knocking, by the dealings of hisprovidence, the warnings and teaching of his word, and the influencesof his Spirit. Christ still graciously, by his word and Spirit, comesto the door of the hearts of sinners. Those who open to him shall enjoyhis presence. If what he finds would make but a poor feast, what hebrings will supply a rich one. He will give fresh supplies of gracesand comforts. In the conclusion is a promise to the overcomingbeliever. Christ himself had temptations and conflicts; he overcamethem all, and was more than a conqueror. Those made like to Christ inhis trials, shall be made like to him in glory. All is closed with thegeneral demand of attention. And these counsels, while suited to thechurches to which they were addressed, are deeply interesting to allmen.
Rev 4:1-8	<br>After the Lord Jesus had instructed the apostle to write to thechurches "the things that are," there was another vision. The apostlesaw a throne set in heaven, an emblem of the universal dominion ofJehovah. He saw a glorious One upon the throne, not described by humanfeatures, so as to be represented by a likeness or image, but only byhis surpassing brightness. These seem emblems of the excellence of theDivine nature, and of God's awful justice. The rainbow is a fit emblemof that covenant of promise which God has made with Christ, as the Headof the church, and with all his people in him. The prevailing colourwas a pleasant green, showing the reviving and refreshing nature of thenew covenant. Four-and-twenty seats around the throne, were filled withfour-and-twenty elders, representing, probably, the whole church ofGod. Their sitting denotes honour, rest, and satisfaction; theirsitting about the throne signifies nearness to God, the sight andenjoyment they have of him. They were clothed in white raiment; theimputed righteousness of the saints and their holiness: they had ontheir heads crowns of gold, signifying the glory they have with him.Lightnings and voices came from the throne; the awful declarations Godmakes to his church, of his sovereign will and pleasure. Seven lamps offire were burning before the throne; the gifts, graces, and operationsof the Spirit of God in the churches of Christ, dispensed according tothe will and pleasure of Him who sits upon the throne. In the gospelchurch, the laver for purification is the blood of the Lord JesusChrist, which cleanses from all sin. In this all must be washed, to beadmitted into the gracious presence of God on earth, and his gloriouspresence in heaven. The apostle saw four living creatures, between thethrone and the circle of the elders, standing between God and thepeople. These seem to signify the true ministers of the gospel, becauseof their place between God and the people. This also is shown by thedescription given, denoting wisdom, courage, diligence, and discretion,and the affections by which they mount up toward heaven.
Rev 4:9-11	<br>All true believers wholly ascribe their redemption and conversion,their present privileges and future hopes, to the eternal and most holyGod. Thus rise the for-ever harmonious, thankful songs of the redeemedin heaven. Would we on earth do like them, let our praises be constant,not interrupted; united, not divided; thankful, not cold and formal;humble, not self-confident.
Rev 5:1-7	<br>The apostle saw in the hand of Him that sat upon the throne, a roll ofparchments in the form usual in those times, and sealed with sevenseals. This represented the secret purposes of God about to berevealed. The designs and methods of Divine Providence, toward thechurch and the world, are stated, fixed, and made a matter of record.The counsels of God are altogether hidden from the eye andunderstanding of the creature. The several parts are not unsealed andopened at once, but after each other, till the whole mystery of God'scounsel and conduct is finished in the world. The creatures cannot openit, nor read it; the Lord only can do so. Those who see most of God,are most desirous to see more; and those who have seen his glory,desire to know his will. But even good men may be too eager and hastyto look into the mysteries of the Divine conduct. Such desires, if notsoon answered, turn to grief and sorrow. If John wept much because hecould not look into the book of God's decrees, what reason have many toshed floods of tears for their ignorance of the gospel of Christ ofthat on which everlasting salvation depends! We need not weep that wecannot foresee future events respecting ourselves in this world; theeager expectation of future prospects, or the foresight of futurecalamities, would alike unfit us for present duties and conflicts, orrender our prosperous days distressing. Yet we may desire to learn,from the promises and prophecies of Scripture, what will be the finalevent to believers and to the church; and the Incarnate Son hasprevailed, that we should learn all that we need to know. Christ standsas Mediator between God and both ministers and people. He is called aLion, but he appears as a Lamb slain. He appears with the marks of hissufferings, to show that he pleads for us in heaven, in virtue of hissatisfaction. He appears as a Lamb, having seven horns and seven eyes;perfect power to execute all the will of God, and perfect wisdom tounderstand it, and to do it in the most effectual manner. The Fatherput the book of his eternal counsels into the hand of Christ, andChrist readily and gladly took it into his hand; for he delights tomake known the will of his Father; and the Holy Spirit is given by himto reveal the truth and will of God.
Rev 5:8-14	<br>It is matter of joy to all the world, to see that God deals with men ingrace and mercy through the Redeemer. He governs the world, not merelyas a Creator, but as our Saviour. The harps were instruments of praise;the vials were full of odours, or incense, which signify the prayers ofthe saints: prayer and praise should always go together. Christ hasredeemed his people from the bondage of sin, guilt, and Satan. He hasnot only purchased liberty for them, but the highest honour andpreferment; he made them kings and priests; kings, to rule over theirown spirits, and to overcome the world, and the evil one; and he makesthem priests; giving them access to himself, and liberty to offer upspiritual sacrifices. What words can more fully declare that Christ is,and ought to be worshipped, equally with the Father, by all creatures,to all eternity! Happy those who shall adore and praise in heaven, andwho shall for ever bless the Lamb, who delivered and set them apart forhimself by his blood. How worthy art thou, O God, Father, Son, and HolyGhost, of our highest praises! All creatures should proclaim thygreatness, and adore thy majesty.
Rev 6:1-8	<br>Christ, the Lamb, opens the first seal: observe what appeared. A rideron a white horse. By the going forth of this white horse, a time ofpeace, or the early progress of the Christian religion, seems to beintended; its going forth in purity, at the time when its heavenlyFounder sent his apostles to teach all nations, adding, Lo! I am withyou always, even to the end of the world. The Divine religion goes outcrowned, having the Divine favour resting upon it, armed spirituallyagainst its foes, and destined to be victorious in the end. On openingthe second seal, a red horse appeared; this signifies desolatingjudgments. The sword of war and persecution is a dreadful judgment; ittakes away peace from the earth, one of the greatest blessings; and menwho should love one another, and help one another, are set upon killingone another. Such scenes also followed the pure age of earlyChristianity, when, neglectful of charity and the bond of peace, theChristian leaders, divided among themselves, appealed to the sword, andentangled themselves in guilt. On opening the third seal, a black horseappeared; a colour denoting mourning and woe, darkness and ignorance.He that sat on it had a yoke in his hand. Attempts were made to put ayoke of superstitious observances on the disciples. As the stream ofChristianity flowed further from its pure fountain, it became more andmore corrupt. During the progress of this black horse, the necessariesof life should be at excessive prices, and the more costly thingsshould not be hurt. According to prophetic language, these articlessignified that food of religious knowledge, by which the souls of menare sustained unto everlasting life; such we are invited to buy, Isa55:1. But when the dark clouds of ignorance and superstition, denotedby the black horse, spread over the Christian world, the knowledge andpractice of true religion became scarce. When a people loathe theirspiritual food, God may justly deprive them of their daily bread. Thefamine of bread is a terrible judgment; but the famine of the word ismore so. Upon opening the fourth seal, another horse appeared, of apale colour. The rider was Death, the king of terrors. The attendants,or followers of this king of terrors, hell, a state of eternal miseryto all who die in their sins; and in times of general destruction,multitudes go down unprepared into the pit. The period of the fourthseal is one of great slaughter and devastation, destroying whatever maytend to make life happy, making ravages on the spiritual lives of men.Thus the mystery of iniquity was completed, and its power extended bothover the lives and consciences of men. The exact times of these fourseals cannot be ascertained, for the changes were gradual. God gavethem power, that is, those instruments of his anger, or thosejudgments: all public calamities are at his command; they only go forthwhen God sends them, and no further than he permits.
Rev 6:9-11	<br>The sight the apostle beheld at the opening the fifth seal was veryaffecting. He saw the souls of the martyrs under the altar; at the footof the altar in heaven, at the feet of Christ. Persecutors can onlykill the body; after that there is no more they can do; the soul lives.God has provided a good place in the better world, for those who arefaithful unto death. It is not their own death, but the sacrifice ofChrist, that gives them entrance into heaven. The cause in which theysuffered, was for the word of God; the best any man can lay down hislife for; faith in God's word, and the unshaken confession of thatfaith. They commit their cause to Him to whom vengeance belongs. TheLord is the comforter of his afflicted servants, and precious is theirblood in his sight. As the measure of the sin of persecutors is fillingup, so is the number of the persecuted, martyred servants of Christ.When this is fulfilled, God will send tribulation to those who troublethem, and unbroken happiness and rest to those that are troubled.
Rev 6:12-17	<br>When the sixth seal was opened, there was a great earthquake. Thefoundations of churches and states would be terribly shaken. Such boldfigurative descriptions of great changes abound in the prophecies ofScripture; for these events are emblems, and declare the end of theworld and the day of judgment. Dread and terror would seize on allsorts of men. Neither grandeur, riches, valour, nor strength, cansupport men at that time. They would be glad to be no more seen; yea,to have no longer any being. Though Christ be a Lamb, he can be angry,and the wrath of the Lamb is exceedingly dreadful; for if the Redeemerhimself, who appeases the wrath of God, be our enemy, where shall wefind a friend to plead for us? As men have their day of opportunity,and their seasons of grace, so God has his day of righteous wrath. Itseems that the overthrow of the paganism of the Roman empire is heremeant. The idolaters are described as hiding themselves in their densand secret caves, and vainly seeking to escape ruin. In such a day,when the signs of the times show those who believe in God's word, thatthe King of kings is approaching, Christians are called to a decidedcourse, and to a bold confession of Christ and his truth before theirfellowmen. Whatever they may have to endure, the short contempt of manis to be borne, rather than that shame which is everlasting.
Rev 7:1-8	<br>In the figurative language of Scripture, the blowing of the four windstogether, means a dreadful and general destruction. But the destructionis delayed. Seals were used to mark for each person his ownpossessions. This mark is the witness of the Holy Ghost, printed in thehearts of believers. And the Lord would not suffer his people to beafflicted before they were marked, that they might be prepared againstall conflicts. And, observe, of those who are thus sealed by theSpirit, the seal must be on the forehead, plainly to be seen alike byfriends and foes, but not by the believer himself, except as he looksstedfastly in the glass of God's word. The number of those who weresealed, may be understood to stand for the remnant of people which Godreserved. Though the church of God is but a little flock, in comparisonwith the wicked world, yet it is a society really large, and to bestill more enlarged. Here the universal church is figured under thetype of Israel.
Rev 7:9-12	<br>The first fruits of Christ having led the way, the Gentiles convertedlater follow, and ascribe their salvation to God and the Redeemer, withtriumph. In acts of religious worship we come nigh to God, and mustcome by Christ; the throne of God could not be approached by sinners,were it not for a Mediator. They were clothed with the robes ofjustification, holiness, and victory; and they had palms in theirhands, as conquerors used to appear in their triumphs. Such a gloriousappearance will the faithful servants of God make at last, when theyhave fought the good fight of faith, and finished their course. With aloud voice they gave to God and the Lamb the praise of the greatsalvation. Those who enjoy eternal happiness must and will bless boththe Father and the Son; they will do it publicly, and with fervour. Wesee what is the work of heaven, and we ought to begin it now, to haveour hearts much in it, and to long for that world where our praises, aswell as our happiness, will be made perfect.
Rev 7:13-17	<br>Faithful Christians deserve our notice and respect; we should mark theupright. Those who would gain knowledge, must not be ashamed to seekinstruction from any who can give it. The way to heaven is through manytribulations; but tribulation, how great soever, shall not separate usfrom the love of God. Tribulation makes heaven more welcome and moreglorious. It is not the blood of the martyrs, but the blood of theLamb, that can wash away sin, and make the soul pure and clean in thesight of God; other blood stains, this is the only blood that makes therobes of the saints white and clean. They are happy in theiremployment; heaven is a state of service, though not of suffering; itis a state of rest, but not of sloth; it is a praising, delightfulrest. They have had sorrows, and shed many tears on account of sin andaffliction; but God himself, with his own gracious hand, will wipethose tears away. He deals with them as a tender father. This shouldsupport the Christian under all his troubles. As all the redeemed owetheir happiness wholly to sovereign mercy; so the work and worship ofGod their Saviour is their element; his presence and favour completetheir happiness, nor can they conceive of any other joy. To Him may allhis people come; from him they receive every needed grace; and to himlet them offer all praise and glory.
Rev 8:1-6	<br>The seventh seal is opened. There was profound silence in heaven for aspace; all was quiet in the church, for whenever the church on earthcries through oppression, that cry reaches up to heaven; or it is asilence of expectation. Trumpets were given to the angels, who were tosound them. The Lord Jesus is the High Priest of the church, having agolden censer, and much incense, fulness of merit in his own gloriousperson. Would that men studied to know the fulness that is in Christ,and endeavoured to be acquainted with his excellency. Would that theywere truly persuaded that Christ has such an office as that ofIntercessor, which he now performs with deep sympathy. No prayers, thusrecommended, was ever denied hearing and acceptance. These prayers,thus accepted in heaven, produced great changes upon earth. TheChristian worship and religion, pure and heavenly in its origin andnature, when sent down to earth and conflicting with the passions andworldly projects of sinful men, produced remarkable tumults, here setforth in prophetical language, as our Lord himself declared, Lu 12:49.
Rev 8:7-13	<br>The first angel sounded the first trumpet, and there followed hail andfire mingled with blood. A storm of heresies, a mixture of dreadfulerrors falling on the church, or a tempest of destruction. The secondangel sounded, and a great mountain, burning with fire, was cast intothe sea; and the third part of the sea became blood. By this mountainsome understand leaders of the persecutions; others, Rome sacked by theGoths and Vandals, with great slaughter and cruelty. The third angelsounded, and there fell a star from heaven. Some take this to be aneminent governor; others take it to be some person in power whocorrupted the churches of Christ. The doctrines of the gospel, thesprings of spiritual life, comfort, and vigour, to the souls of men,are corrupted and made bitter by the mixture of dangerous errors, sothat the souls of men find ruin where they sought refreshment. Thefourth angel sounded, and darkness fell upon the great lights ofheaven, that give light to the world, the sun, and the moon, and thestars. The guides and governors are placed higher than the people, andare to dispense light, and kind influences to them. Where the gospelcomes to a people, and has not proper effects on their hearts andlives, it is followed with dreadful judgments. God gives alarm by thewritten word, by ministers, by men's own consciences, and by the signsof the times; so that if people are surprised, it is their own fault.The anger of God makes all comforts bitter, and even life itselfburdensome. But God, in this world, sets bounds to the most terriblejudgments. Corruption of doctrine and worship in the church are greatjudgments, and also are the usual causes and tokens of other judgmentscoming on a people. Before the other three trumpets were sounded, therewas solemn warning how terrible the calamities would be that shouldfollow. If lesser judgments do not take effect the church and the worldmust expect greater; and when God comes to punish the world, theinhabitants shall tremble before him. Let sinners take warning to fleefrom the wrath to come; let believers learn to value and to be thankfulfor their privileges; and let them patiently continue in well doing.
Rev 9:1-12	<br>Upon sounding the fifth trumpet, a star fell from heaven to the earth.Having ceased to be a minister of Christ, he who is represented by thisstar becomes the minister of the devil; and lets loose the powers ofhell against the churches of Christ. On the opening of the bottomlesspit, there arose a great smoke. The devil carries on his designs byblinding the eyes of men, by putting out light and knowledge, andpromoting ignorance and error. Out of this smoke there came a swarm oflocusts, emblems of the devil's agents, who promote superstition,idolatry, error, and cruelty. The trees and the grass, the truebelievers, whether young or more advanced, should be untouched. But asecret poison and infection in the soul, should rob many others ofpurity, and afterwards of peace. The locusts had no power to hurt thosewho had the seal of God. God's all-powerful, distinguishing grace willkeep his people from total and final apostacy. The power is limited toa short season; but it would be very sharp. In such events the faithfulshare the common calamity, but from the pestilence of error they mightand would be safe. We collect from Scripture, that such errors were totry and prove the Christians, 1Co 11:19. And early writers plainlyrefer this to the first great host of corrupters who overspread theChristian church.
Rev 9:13-21	<br>The sixth angel sounded, and here the power of the Turks seems thesubject. Their time is limited. They not only slew in war, but broughta poisonous and ruinous religion. The antichristian generation repentednot under these dreadful judgments. From this sixth trumpet learn thatGod can make one enemy of the church a scourge and a plague to another.The idolatry in the remains of the eastern church and elsewhere, andthe sins of professed Christians, render this prophecy and itsfulfilment more wonderful. And the attentive reader of Scripture andhistory, may find his faith and hope strengthened by events, which inother respects fill his heart with anguish and his eyes with tears,while he sees that men who escape these plagues, repent not of theirevil works, but go on with idolatries, wickedness, and cruelty, tillwrath comes upon them to the utmost.
Rev 10:1-7	<br>The apostle saw another representation. The person communicating thisdiscovery probably was our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, or it was toshow his glory. He veils his glory, which is too great for mortal eyesto behold; and throws a veil upon his dispensations. A rainbow was uponhis head; our Lord is always mindful of his covenant. His awful voicewas echoed by seven thunders; solemn and terrible ways of discoveringthe mind of God. We know not the subjects of the seven thunders, northe reasons for suppressing them. There are great events in history,perhaps relating to the Christian church, which are not noticed in openprophecy. The final salvation of the righteous, and the final successof true religion on earth, are engaged for by the unfailing word of theLord. Though the time may not be yet, it cannot be far distant. Verysoon, as to us, time will be no more; but if we are believers, a happyeternity will follow: we shall from heaven behold and rejoice in thetriumphs of Christ, and his cause on earth.
Rev 10:8-11	<br>Most men feel pleasure in looking into future events, and all good menlike to receive a word from God. But when this book of prophecy wasthoroughly digested by the apostle, the contents would be bitter; therewere things so awful and terrible, such grievous persecutions of thepeople of God, such desolations in the earth, that the foresight andforeknowledge of them would be painful to his mind. Let us seek to betaught by Christ, and to obey his orders; daily meditating on his word,that it may nourish our souls; and then declaring it according to ourseveral stations. The sweetness of such contemplations will often bemingled with bitterness, while we compare the Scriptures with the stateof the world and the church, or even with that of our own hearts.
Rev 11:1,2	<br>This prophetical passage about measuring the temple seems to refer toEzekiel's vision. The design of this measuring seems to be thepreservation of the church in times of public danger; or for its trial,or for its reformation. The worshippers must be measured; whether theymake God's glory their end, and his word their rule, in all their actsof worship. Those in the outer court, worship in a false manner, orwith dissembling hearts, and will be found among his enemies. God willhave a temple and an altar in the world, till the end of time. He looksstrictly to his temple. The holy city, the visible church, is troddenunder foot; is filled with idolaters, infidels, and hypocrites. But thedesolations of the church are limited, and she shall be delivered outof all her troubles.
Rev 11:3-13	<br>In the time of treading down, God kept his faithful witnesses to attestthe truth of his word and worship, and the excellence of his ways, Thenumber of these witnesses is small, yet enough. They prophesy insackcloth. It shows their afflicted, persecuted state, and deep sorrowfor the abominations against which they protested. They are supportedduring their great and hard work, till it is done. When they hadprophesied in sackcloth the greatest part of 1260 years, antichrist,the great instrument of the devil, would war against them, with forceand violence for a time. Determined rebels against the light rejoice,as on some happy event, when they can silence, drive to a distance, ordestroy the faithful servants of Christ, whose doctrine and conducttorment them. It does not appear that the term is yet expired, and thewitnesses are not a present exposed to endure such terrible outwardsufferings as in former times; but such things may again happen, andthere is abundant cause to prophesy in sackcloth, on account of thestate of religion. The depressed state of real Christianity may relateonly to the western church. The Spirit of life from God, quickens deadsouls, and shall quicken the dead bodies of his people, and his dyinginterest in the world. The revival of God's work and witnesses, willstrike terror into the souls of his enemies. Where there is guilt,there is fear; and a persecuting spirit, though cruel, is a cowardlyspirit. It will be no small part of the punishment of persecutors, bothin this world, and at the great day, that they see the faithfulservants of God honoured and advanced. The Lord's witnesses must not beweary of suffering and service, nor hastily grasp at the reward; butmust stay till their Master calls them. The consequence of their beingthus exalted was a mighty shock and convulsion in the antichristianempire. Events alone can show the meaning of this. But whenever God'swork and witnesses revive, the devil's work and witnesses fall beforehim. And that the slaying of the witnesses is future, appears to beprobable.
Rev 11:14-19	<br>Before the sounding of the seventh and last trumpet, there is the usualdemand of attention. The saints and angels in heaven know the right ofour God and Saviour to rule over all the world. But the nations metGod's wrath with their own anger. It was a time in which he wasbeginning to reward his people's faithful services, and sufferings; andtheir enemies fretted against God, and so increased their guilt, andhastened their destruction. By the opening the temple of God in heaven,may be meant, that there was a more free communication between heavenand earth; prayer and praises more freely and frequently going up,graces and blessings plentifully coming down. But it rather seems torefer to the church of God on earth. In the reign of antichrist, God'slaw was laid aside, and made void by traditions and decrees; theScriptures were locked up from the people, but now they are brought tothe view of all. This, like the ark, is a token of the presence of Godreturned to his people, and his favour toward them in Jesus Christ, asthe Propitiation for their sins. The great blessing of the Reformationwas attended with very awful providences; as by terrible things inrighteousness God answered the prayers presented in his holy temple nowopened.
Rev 12:1-6	<br>The church, under the emblem of a woman, the mother of believers, wasseen by the apostle in vision, in heaven. She was clothed with the sun,justified, sanctified, and shining by union with Christ, the Sun ofRighteousness. The moon was under her feet; she was superior to thereflected and feebler light of the revelation made by Moses. Having onher head a crown of twelve stars; the doctrine of the gospel, preachedby the twelve apostles, is a crown of glory to all true believers. Asin pain to bring forth a holy family; desirous that the conviction ofsinners might end in their conversion. A dragon is a known emblem ofSatan, and his chief agents, or those who govern for him on earth, atthat time the pagan empire of Rome, the city built upon seven hills. Ashaving ten horns, divided into ten kingdoms. Having seven crowns,representing seven forms of government. As drawing with his tail athird part of the stars in heaven, and casting them down to the earth;persecuting and seducing the ministers and teachers. As watchful tocrush the Christian religion; but in spite of the opposition ofenemies, the church brought forth a manly issue of true and faithfulprofessors, in whom Christ was truly formed anew; even the mystery ofChrist, that Son of God who should rule the nations, and in whose righthis members partake the same glory. This blessed offspring wasprotected of God.
Rev 12:7-11	<br>The attempts of the dragon proved unsuccessful against the church, andfatal to his own interests. The seat of this war was in heaven; in thechurch of Christ, the kingdom of heaven on earth. The parties wereChrist, the great Angel of the covenant, and his faithful followers;and Satan and his instruments. The strength of the church is in havingthe Lord Jesus for the Captain of their salvation. Pagan idolatry,which was the worship of devils, was cast out of the empire by thespreading of Christianity. The salvation and strength of the church,are only to be ascribed to the King and Head of the church. Theconquered enemy hates the presence of God, yet he is willing to appearthere, to accuse the people of God. Let us take heed that we give himno cause to accuse us; and that, when we have sinned, we go before theLord, condemn ourselves, and commit our cause to Christ as ourAdvocate. The servants of God overcame Satan by the blood of the Lamb,as the cause. By the word of their testimony: the powerful preaching ofthe gospel is mighty, through God, to pull down strong holds. By theircourage and patience in sufferings: they loved not their lives so wellbut they could lay them down in Christ's cause. These were the warriorsand the weapons by which Christianity overthrew the power of paganidolatry; and if Christians had continued to fight with these weapons,and such as these, their victories would have been more numerous andglorious, and the effects more lasting. The redeemed overcame by asimple reliance on the blood of Christ, as the only ground of theirhopes. In this we must be like them. We must not blend any thing elsewith this.
Rev 12:12-17	<br>The church and all her friends might well be called to praise God fordeliverance from pagan persecution, though other troubles awaited her.The wilderness is a desolate place, and full of serpents and scorpions,uncomfortable and destitute of provisions; yet a place of safety, aswell as where one might be alone. But being thus retired could notprotect the woman. The flood of water is explained by many to mean theinvasions of barbarians, by which the western empire was overwhelmed;for the heathen encouraged their attacks, in the hope of destroyingChristianity. But ungodly men, for their worldly interests, protectedthe church amidst these tumults, and the overthrow of the empire didnot help the cause of idolatry. Or, this may be meant of a flood oferror, by which the church of God was in danger of being overwhelmedand carried away. The devil, defeated in his designs upon the church,turns his rage against persons and places. Being faithful to God andChrist, in doctrine, worship, and practice, exposes to the rage ofSatan; and will do so till the last enemy shall be destroyed.
Rev 13:1-10	<br>The apostle, standing on the shore, saw a savage beast rise out of thesea; a tyrannical, idolatrous, persecuting power, springing up out ofthe troubles which took place. It was a frightful monster! It appearsto mean that worldly, oppressing dominion, which for many ages, evenfrom the times of the Babylonish captivity, had been hostile to thechurch. The first beast then began to oppress and persecute therighteous for righteousness' sake, but they suffered most under thefourth beast of Daniel, (the Roman empire,) which has afflicted thesaints with many cruel persecutions. The source of its power was thedragon. It was set up by the devil, and supported by him. The woundingthe head may be the abolishing pagan idolatry; and the healing of thewound, introducing popish idolatry, the same in substance, only in anew dress, but which as effectually answers the devil's design. Theworld admired its power, policy and success. They paid honour andsubjection to the devil and his instruments. It exercised infernalpower and policy, requiring men to render that honour to creatureswhich belongs to God alone. Yet the devil's power and success arelimited. Christ has a chosen remnant, redeemed by his blood, recordedin his book, sealed by his Spirit; and though the devil and antichristmay overcome the body, and take away the natural life, they cannotconquer the soul, nor prevail with true believers to forsake theirSaviour, and join his enemies. Perseverance in the faith of the gospeland true worship of God, in this great hour of trial and temptation,which would deceive all but the elect, is the character of thoseregistered in the book of life. This powerful motive and encouragementto constancy, is the great design of the whole Revelation.
Rev 13:11-18	<br>Those who understand the first beast to denote a worldly power, takethe second to be also a persecuting and assumed power, which acts underthe disguise of religion, and of charity to the souls of men. It is aspiritual dominion, professing to be derived from Christ, and exercisedat first in a gentle manner, but soon spake like the dragon. Its speechbetrayed it; for it gives forth those false doctrines and crueldecrees, which show it to belong to the dragon, and not to the Lamb. Itexercised all the power of the former beast. It pursues the samedesign, to draw men from worshipping the true God, and to subject thesouls of men to the will and control of men. The second beast hascarried on its designs, by methods whereby men should be deceived toworship the former beast, in the new shape, or likeness made for it. Bylying wonders, pretended miracles. And by severe censures. Also byallowing none to enjoy natural or civil rights, who will not worshipthat beast which is the image of the pagan beast. It is made aqualification for buying and selling, as well as for places of profitand trust, that they oblige themselves to use all their interest,power, and endeavour, to forward the dominion of the beast, which ismeant by receiving his mark. To make an image to the beast, whosedeadly wound was healed, would be to give form and power to hisworship, or to require obedience to his commands. To worship the imageof the beast, implies being subject to those things which stamp thecharacter of the picture, and render it the image of the beast. Thenumber of the beast is given, so as to show the infinite wisdom of God,and to exercise the wisdom of men. The number is the number of a man,computed after the usual manner among men, and it is 666. What or whois intended by this, remains a mystery. To almost every religiousdispute this number has yet been applied, and it may reasonably bedoubted whether the meaning has yet been discovered. But he who haswisdom and understanding, will see that all the enemies of God arenumbered and marked out for destruction; that the term of their powerwill soon expire, and that all nations shall submit to our King ofrighteousness and peace.
Rev 14:1-5	<br>Mount Sion is the gospel church. Christ is with his church, and in themidst of her in all her troubles, therefore she is not consumed. Hispresence secures perseverance. His people appear honourably. They havethe name of God written in their foreheads; they make a bold and openprofession of their faith in God and Christ, and this is followed bysuitable actings. There were persons in the darkest times, who venturedand laid down their lives for the worship and truth of the gospel ofChrist. They kept themselves clean from the wicked abominations of thefollowers of antichrist. Their hearts were right with God; and theywere freely pardoned in Christ; he is glorified in them, and they inhim. May it be our prayer, our endeavour, our ambition, to be found inthis honourable company. Those who are really sanctified and justifiedare meant here, for no hypocrite, however plausible, can be accountedto be without fault before God. (Rev 14:6-13)
Rev 14:6-13	<br>The progress of the Reformation appears to be here set forth. The fourproclamations are plain in their meaning; that all Christians may beencouraged, in the time of trial, to be faithful to their Lord. Thegospel is the great means whereby men are brought to fear God, and togive glory to him. The preaching of the everlasting gospel shakes thefoundations of antichrist in the world, and hastens its downfal. If anypersist in being subject to the beast, and in promoting his cause, theymust expect to be for ever miserable in soul and body. The believer isto venture or suffer any thing in obeying the commandments of God, andprofessing the faith of Jesus. May God bestow this patience upon us.Observe the description of those that are and shall be blessed: such asdie in the Lord; die in the cause of Christ, in a state of union withChrist; such as are found in Christ when death comes. They rest fromall sin, temptation, sorrow, and persecution; for there the wickedcease from troubling, there the weary are at rest. Their works followthem: do not go before as their title, or purchase, but follow them asproofs of their having lived and died in the Lord: the remembrance ofthem will be pleasant, and the reward far above all their services andsufferings. This is made sure by the testimony of the Spirit,witnessing with their spirits, and the written word.
Rev 14:14-20	<br>Warnings and judgments not having produced reformation, the sins of thenations are filled up, and they become ripe for judgments, representedby a harvest, an emblem which is used to signify the gathering of therighteous, when ripe for heaven, by the mercy of God. The harvest timeis when the corn is ripe; when the believers are ripe for heaven, thenthe wheat of the earth shall be gathered into Christ's garner. And by avintage. The enemies of Christ and his church are not destroyed, tillby their sin they are ripe for ruin, and then he will spare them nolonger. The wine-press is the wrath of God, some terrible calamity,probably the sword, shedding the blood of the wicked. The patience ofGod towards sinners, is the greatest miracle in the world; but, thoughlasting, it will not be everlasting; and ripeness in sin is a sureproof of judgment at hand.
Rev 15:1-4	<br>Seven angels appeared in heaven; prepared to finish the destruction ofantichrist. As the measure of Babylon's sins was filled up, it findsthe full measure of Divine wrath. While believers stand in this world,in times of trouble, as upon a sea of glass mingled with fire, they maylook forward to their final deliverance, while new mercies call forthnew hymns of praise. The more we know of God's wonderful works, themore we shall praise his greatness as the Lord God Almighty, theCreator and Ruler of all worlds; but his title of Emmanuel, the King ofsaints, will make him dear to us. Who that considers the power of God'swrath, the value of his favour, or the glory of his holiness, wouldrefuse to fear and honour him alone? His praise is above heaven andearth.
Rev 15:5-8	<br>In the judgments God executes upon antichrist and his followers, hefulfils the prophecies and promises of his word. These angels areprepared for their work, clothed with pure and white linen, theirbreasts girded with golden girdles, representing the holiness, andrighteousness, and excellence of these dealings with men. They areministers of Divine justice, and do every thing in a pure and holymanner. They were armed with the wrath of God against his enemies. Eventhe meanest creature, when armed with the anger of God, will be toohard for any man in the world. The angels received the vials from oneof the four living creatures, one of the ministers of the true church,as in answer to the prayers of the ministers and people of God.Antichrist could not be destroyed without a great shock to all theworld, and even the people of God would be in trouble and confusionwhile the great work was doing. The greatest deliverances of the churchare brought about by awful and astonishing steps of Providence; and thehappy state of the true church will not begin till obstinate enemiesshall be destroyed, and lukewarm or formal Christians are purified.Then, whatever is against Scripture being purged away, the whole churchshall be spiritual, and the whole being brought to purity, unity, andspirituality, shall be firmly established.
Rev 16:1-7	<br>We are to pray that the will of God may be done on earth as it is donein heaven. Here is a succession of terrible judgments of Providence;and there seems to be an allusion to several of the plagues of Egypt.The sins were alike, and so were the punishments. The vials refer tothe seven trumpets, which represented the rise of antichrist; and thefall of the enemies of the church shall bear some resemblance to theirrise. All things throughout their earth, their air, their sea, theirrivers, their cities, all are condemned to ruin, all accursed for thewickedness of that people. No wonder that angels, who witness orexecute the Divine vengeance on the obstinate haters of God, of Christ,and of holiness, praise his justice and truth; and adore his awfuljudgments, when he brings upon cruel persecutors the tortures they madehis saints and prophets suffer.
Rev 16:8-11	<br>The heart of man is so desperately wicked, that the most severemiseries never will bring any to repent, without the special grace ofGod. Hell itself is filled with blasphemies; and those are ignorant ofthe history of human nature, of the Bible, and of their own hearts, whodo not know that the more men suffer, and the more plainly they see thehand of God in their sufferings, the more furiously they often rageagainst him. Let sinners now seek repentance from Christ, and the graceof the Holy Spirit, or they will have the anguish and horror of anunhumbled, impenitent, and desperate heart; thus adding to their guiltand misery through all eternity. Darkness is opposed to wisdom andknowledge, and forebodes the confusion and folly of the idolaters andfollowers of the beast. It is opposed to pleasure and joy, andsignifies anguish and vexation of spirit.
Rev 16:12-16	<br>This probably shows the destruction of the Turkish power, and ofidolatry, and that a way will be made for the return of the Jews. Or,take it for Rome, as mystical Babylon, the name of Babylon being putfor Rome, which was meant, but was not then to be directly named. WhenRome is destroyed, her river and merchandise must suffer with her. Andperhaps a way will be opened for the eastern nations to come into thechurch of Christ. The great dragon will collect all his forces, to makeone desperate struggle before all be lost. God warns of this greattrial, to engage his people to prepare for it. These will be times ofgreat temptation; therefore Christ, by his apostle, calls on hisprofessed servants to expect his sudden coming, and to watch that theymight not be put to shame, as apostates or hypocrites. HoweverChristians differ, as to their views of the times and seasons of eventsyet to be brought to pass, on this one point all are agreed, JesusChrist, the Lord of glory, will suddenly come again to judge the world.To those living near to Christ, it is an object of joyful hope andexpectation, and delay is not desired by them.
Rev 16:17-21	<br>The seventh and last angel poured forth his vial, and the downfal ofBabylon was finished. The church triumphant in heaven saw it andrejoiced; the church in conflict on earth saw it and became triumphant.God remembered the great and wicked city; though for some time heseemed to have forgotten her idolatry and cruelty. All that was mostsecure was carried away by the ruin. Men blasphemed: the greatestjudgments that can befal men, will not bring to repentance without thegrace of God. To be hardened against God, by his righteous judgments,is a certain token of sure and utter destruction.
Rev 17:1-6	<br>Rome clearly appears to be meant in this chapter. Pagan Rome subduedand ruled with military power, not by art and flatteries. She left thenations in general to their ancient usages and worship. But it is wellknown that by crafty and politic management, with all kinds of deceitof unrighteousness, papal Rome has obtained and kept her rule overkings and nations. Here were allurements of worldly honour and riches,pomp and pride, suited to sensual and worldly minds. Prosperity, pomp,and splendour, feed the pride and lusts of the human heart, but are nosecurity against the Divine vengeance. The golden cup represents theallurements, and delusions, by which this mystical Babylon has obtainedand kept her influence, and seduced others to join her abominations.She is named, from her infamous practices, a mother of harlots;training them up to idolatry and all sorts of wickedness. She filledherself with the blood of the saints and martyrs of Jesus. Sheintoxicated herself with it; and it was so pleasant to her, that shenever was satisfied. We cannot but wonder at the oceans of Christianblood shed by men called Christians; yet when we consider theseprophecies, these awful deeds testify to the truth of the gospel. Andlet all beware of a splendid, gainful, or fashionable religion. Let usavoid the mysteries of iniquity, and study diligently the great mysteryof godliness, that we may learn humility and gratitude from the exampleof Christ. The more we seek to resemble him, the less we shall beliable to be deceived by antichrist.
Rev 17:7-14	<br>The beast on which the woman sat was, and is not, and yet is. It was aseat of idolatry and persecution, and is not; not in the ancient form,which was pagan: yet it is; it is truly the seat of idolatry andtyranny, though of another sort and form. It would deceive into stupidand blind submission all the inhabitants of the earth within itsinfluence, except the remnant of the elect. This beast was seven heads,seven mountains, the seven hills on which Rome stands; and seven kings,seven sorts of government. Five were gone by when this prophecy waswritten; one was then in being; the other was yet to come. This beast,directed by the papacy, makes an eighth governor, and sets up idolatryagain. It had ten horns, which are said to be ten kings who had as yetno kingdoms; they should not rise up till the Roman empire was broken;but should for a time be very zealous in her interest. Christ mustreign till all enemies be put under his feet. The reason of the victoryis, that he is the King of kings, and Lord of lords. He has supremedominion and power over all things; all the powers of earth and hellare subject to his control. His followers are called to this warfare,are fitted for it, and will be faithful in it.
Rev 17:15-18	<br>God so ruled the hearts of these kings, by his power over them, and byhis providence, that they did those things, without intending it, whichhe purposed and foretold. They shall see their folly, and how they havebeen bewitched and enslaved by the harlot, and be made instruments inher destruction. She was that great city which reigned over the kingsof the earth, when John had this vision; and every one knows Rome to bethat city. Believers will be received to the glory of the Lord, whenwicked men will be destroyed in a most awful manner; their joiningtogether in sin, will be turned to hatred and rage, and they willeagerly assist in tormenting each other. But the Lord's portion is hispeople; his counsel shall stand, and he will do all his pleasure, tohis glory, and the happiness of all his servants.
Rev 18:1-8	<br>The downfal and destruction of the mystical Babylon are determined inthe counsels of God. Another angel comes from heaven. This seems to beChrist himself, coming to destroy his enemies, and to shed abroad thelight of his gospel through all nations. The wickedness of this Babylonwas very great; she had forsaken the true God, and set up idols, andhad drawn all sorts of men into spiritual adultery, and by her wealthand luxury kept them in her interest. The spiritual merchandise, bywhich multitudes have wickedly lived in wealth, by the sins and folliesof mankind, seems principally intended. Fair warning is given to allthat expect mercy from God, that they should not only come out of thisBabylon, but assist in her destruction. God may have a people even inBabylon. But God's people shall be called out of Babylon, and calledeffectually, while those that partake with wicked men in their sins,must receive of their plagues. (Rev 18:9-19)
Rev 18:9-19	<br>The mourners had shared Babylon's sensual pleasures, and gained by herwealth and trade. The kings of the earth, whom she flattered intoidolatry, allowing them to be tyrannical over their subjects, whileobedient to her; and the merchants, those who trafficked for herindulgences, pardons, and honours; these mourn. Babylon's friendspartook her sinful pleasures and profits, but are not willing to shareher plagues. The spirit of antichrist is a worldly spirit, and thatsorrow is a mere worldly sorrow; they do not lament for the anger ofGod, but for the loss of outward comforts. The magnificence and richesof the ungodly will avail them nothing, but will render the vengeanceharder to be borne. The spiritual merchandise is here alluded to, whennot only slaves, but the souls of men, are mentioned as articles ofcommerce, to the destroying the souls of millions. Nor has this beenpeculiar to the Roman antichrist, and only her guilt. But letprosperous traders learn, with all their gains, to get the unsearchableriches of Christ; otherwise; even in this life, they may have to mournthat riches make to themselves wings and fly away, and that all thefruits their souls lusted after, are departed from them. Death, at anyrate, will soon end their commerce, and all the riches of the ungodlywill be exchanged, not only for the coffin and the worm, but for thefire that cannot be quenched.
Rev 18:20-24	<br>That which is matter of rejoicing to the servants of God on earth, ismatter of rejoicing to the angels in heaven. The apostles, who arehonoured and daily worshipped at Rome in an idolatrous manner, willrejoice in her fall. The fall of Babylon was an act of God's justice.And because it was a final ruin, this enemy should never molest themany more; of this they were assured by a sign. Let us take warning fromthe things which brought others to destruction, and let us set ouraffections on things above, when we consider the changeable nature ofearthly things.
Rev 19:1-10	<br>Praising God for what we have, is praying for what is yet further to bedone for us. There is harmony between the angels and the saints in thistriumphant song. Christ is the Bridegroom of his ransomed church. Thissecond union will be completed in heaven; but the beginning of theglorious millennium (by which is meant a reign of Christ, or a state ofhappiness, for a thousand years on earth) may be considered as thecelebration of his espousals on earth. Then the church of Christ, beingpurified from errors, divisions, and corruptions, in doctrine,discipline, worship, and practice, will be made ready to be publiclyowned by him as his delight and his beloved. The church appeared; notin the gay, gaudy dress of the mother of harlots, but in fine linen,clean and white. In the robes of Christ's righteousness, imputed forjustification, and imparted for sanctification. The promises of thegospel, the true sayings of God, opened, applied, and sealed by theSpirit of God, in holy ordinances, are the marriage-feast. This seemsto refer to the abundant grace and consolation Christians will receivein the happy days which are to come. The apostle offered honour to theangel. The angel refused it. He directed the apostle to the true andonly object of religious worship; to worship God, and him alone. Thisplainly condemns the practice of those who worship the elements ofbread and wine, and saints, and angels; and of those who do not believethat Christ is truly and by nature God, yet pay him a sort of worship.They stand convicted of idolatry by a messenger from heaven. These arethe true sayings of God; of Him who is to be worshipped, as one withthe Father and the Holy Spirit.
Rev 19:11-21	<br>Christ, the glorious Head of the church, is described as on a whitehorse, the emblem of justice and holiness. He has many crowns, for heis King of kings, and Lord of lords. He is arrayed in a vesture dippedin his own blood, by which he purchased his power as Mediator; and inthe blood of his enemies, over whom he always prevails. His name is"The Word of God;" a name none fully knows but himself; only this weknow, that this Word was God manifest in the flesh; but his perfectionscannot be fully understood by any creature. Angels and saints follow,and are like Christ in their armour of purity and righteousness. Thethreatenings of the written word he is going to execute on his enemies.The ensigns of his authority are his name; asserting his authority andpower, warning the most powerful princes to submit, or they must fallbefore him. The powers of earth and hell make their utmost effort.These verses declare important events, foretold by the prophets. Thesepersons were not excused because they did what their leaders bade them.How vain will be the plea of many sinners at the great day! We followedour guides; we did as we saw others do! God has given a rule to walkby, in his word; neither the example of the most, nor of the chief,must influence us contrary thereto: if we do as the most do, we must gowhere the most go, even into the burning lake.
Rev 20:1-3	<br>Here is a vision, showing by a figure the restraints laid on Satanhimself. Christ, with Almighty power, will keep the devil fromdeceiving mankind as he has hitherto done. He never wants power andinstruments to break the power of Satan. Christ shuts by his power, andseals by his authority. The church shall have a time of peace andprosperity, but all her trials are not yet over.
Rev 20:4-6	<br>Here is an account of the reign of the saints, for the same space oftime as Satan is bound. Those who suffer with Christ, shall reign withhim in his spiritual and heavenly kingdom, in conformity to him in hiswisdom, righteousness, and holiness: this is called the firstresurrection, with which none but those who serve Christ, and sufferfor him, shall be favoured. The happiness of these servants of God isdeclared. None can be blessed but those that are holy; and all that areholy shall be blessed. We know something thing of what the first deathis, and it is very awful; but we know not what this second death is. Itmust be much more dreadful; it is the death of the soul, eternalseparation from God. May we never know what it is: those who have beenmade partakers of a spiritual resurrection, are saved from the power ofthe second death. We may expect that a thousand years will follow thedestruction of the antichristian, idolatrous, persecuting powers,during which pure Christianity, in doctrine, worship, and holiness,will be made known over all the earth. By the all-powerful working ofthe Holy Spirit, fallen man will be new-created; and faith and holinesswill as certainly prevail, as unbelief and unholiness now do. We mayeasily perceive what a variety of dreadful pains, diseases, and othercalamities would cease, if all men were true and consistent Christians.All the evils of public and private contests would be ended, andhappiness of every kind largely increased. Every man would try tolighten suffering, instead of adding to the sorrows around him. It isour duty to pray for the promised glorious days, and to do every thingin our public and private stations which can prepare for them.
Rev 20:7-10	<br>While this world lasts, Satan's power in it will not be whollydestroyed, though it may be limited and lessened. No sooner is Satanlet loose, than he again begins deceiving the nations, and stirringthem up to make war with the saints and servants of God. It would bewell if the servants and ministers of Christ were as active andpersevering in doing good, as his enemies in doing mischief. God willfight this last and decisive battle for his people, that the victorymay be complete, and the glory be to himself.
Rev 20:11-15	<br>After the events just foretold, the end will speedily come; and thereis no mention of any thing else, before the appearing of Christ tojudge the world. This will be the great day: the Judge, the Lord JesusChrist, will then put on majesty and terror. The persons to be judgedare the dead, small and great; young and old, low and high, poor andrich. None are so mean, but they have some talents to account for; andnone so great, as to avoid having to account for them. Not only thosealive at the coming of Christ, but all the dead. There is a book ofremembrance both for good and bad: and the book of the sinner'sconscience, though formerly secret, will then be opened. Every man willrecollect all his past actions, though he had long forgotten many ofthem. Another book shall be opened, the book of the Scriptures, therule of life; it represents the Lord's knowledge of his people, and hisdeclaring their repentance, faith, and good works; showing theblessings of the new covenant. By their works men shall be justified orcondemned; he will try their principles by their practices. Thosejustified and acquitted by the gospel, shall be justified and acquittedby the Judge, and shall enter into eternal life, having nothing more tofear from death, or hell, or wicked men; for these are all destroyedtogether. This is the second death; it is the final separation ofsinners from God. Let it be our great concern to see whether our Biblesjustify or condemn us now; for Christ will judge the secrets of all menaccording to the gospel. Who shall dwell with devouring flames?
Rev 21:1-8	<br>The new heaven and the new earth will not be separate from each other;the earth of the saints, their glorified, bodies, will be heavenly. Theold world, with all its troubles and tumults, will have passed away.There will be no sea; this aptly represents freedom from conflictingpassions, temptations, troubles, changes, and alarms; from whatever candivide or interrupt the communion of saints. This new Jerusalem is thechurch of God in its new and perfect state, the church triumphant. Itsblessedness came wholly from God, and depends on him. The presence ofGod with his people in heaven, will not be interrupt as it is on earth,he will dwell with them continually. All effects of former troubleshall be done away. They have often been in tears, by reason of sin, ofaffliction, of the calamities of the church; but no signs, noremembrance of former sorrows shall remain. Christ makes all thingsnew. If we are willing and desirous that the gracious Redeemer shouldmake all things new in order hearts and nature, he will make all thingsnew in respect of our situation, till he has brought us to enjoycomplete happiness. See the certainty of the promise. God gives histitles, Alpha and Omega, the Beginning and the End, as a pledge for thefull performance. Sensual and sinful pleasures are muddy and poisonedwaters; and the best earthly comforts are like the scanty supplies of acistern; when idolized, they become broken cisterns, and yield onlyvexation. But the joys which Christ imparts are like waters springingfrom a fountain, pure, refreshing, abundant, and eternal. Thesanctifying consolations of the Holy Spirit prepare for heavenlyhappiness; they are streams which flow for us in the wilderness. Thefearful durst not meet the difficulties of religion, their slavish fearcame from their unbelief; but those who were so dastardly as not todare to take up the cross of Christ, were yet so desperate as to runinto abominable wickedness. The agonies and terrors of the first deathwill lead to the far greater terrors and agonies of eternal death.
Rev 21:9-21	<br>God has various employments for his holy angels. Sometimes they soundthe trumpet of Divine Providence, and warn a careless world; sometimesthey discover things of a heavenly nature of the heirs of salvation.Those who would have clear views of heaven, must get as near to heavenas they can, on the mount of meditation and faith. The subject of thevision is the church of God in a perfect, triumphant state, shining inits lustre; glorious in relation to Christ; which shows that thehappiness of heaven consists in intercourse with God, and in conformityto him. The change of emblems from a bride to a city, shows that we areonly to take general ideas from this description. The wall is forsecurity. Heaven is a safe state; those who are there, are separatedand secured from all evils and enemies. This city is vast; here is roomfor all the people of God. The foundation of the wall; the promise andpower of God, and the purchase of Christ, are the strong foundations ofthe safety and happiness of the church. These foundations are set forthby twelve sorts of precious stones, denoting the variety and excellenceof the doctrines of the gospel, or of the graces of the Holy Spirit, orthe personal excellences of the Lord Jesus Christ. Heaven has gates;there is a free admission to all that are sanctified; they shall notfind themselves shut out. These gates were all of pearls. Christ is thePearl of great price, and he is our Way to God. The street of the citywas pure gold, like transparent glass. The saints in heaven tread goldunder foot. The saints are there at rest, yet it is not a state ofsleep and idleness; they have communion, not only with God, but withone another. All these glories but faintly represent heaven.
Rev 21:22-27	<br>Perfect and direct communion with God, will more than supply the placeof gospel institutions. And what words can more full express the unionand co-equality of the Son with the Father, in the Godhead? What adismal world would this be, if it were not for the light of the sun!What is there in heaven that supplies its place? The glory of Godlightens that city, and the Lamb is the Light thereof. God in Christwill be an everlasting Fountain of knowledge and joy to the saints inheaven. There is no night, therefore no need of shutting the gates; allis at peace and secure. The whole shows us that we should be more andmore led to think of heaven as filled with the glory of God, andenlightened by the presence of the Lord Jesus. Nothing sinful orunclean, idolatrous, or false and deceitful, can enter. All theinhabitants are made perfect in holiness. Now the saints feel a sadmixture of corruption, which hinders them in the service of God, andinterrupts their communion with him; but, at their entrance into theholy of holies, they are washed in the laver of Christ's blood, andpresented to the Father without spot. None are admitted into heaven whowork abominations. It is free from hypocrites, such as make lies. Asnothing unclean can enter heaven, let us be stirred up by theseglimpses of heavenly things, to use all diligence, and to perfectholiness in the fear of God.
Rev 22:1-5	<br>All streams of earthly comfort are muddy; but these are clear, andrefreshing. They give life, and preserve life, to those who drink ofthem, and thus they will flow for evermore. These point to thequickening and sanctifying influences of the Holy Spirit, as given tosinners through Christ. The Holy Spirit, proceeding from the Father andthe Son, applies this salvation to our souls by his new-creating loveand power. The trees of life are fed by the pure waters of the riverthat comes from the throne of God. The presence of God in heaven, isthe health and happiness of the saints. This tree was an emblem ofChrist, and of all the blessings of his salvation; and the leaves forthe healing of the nations, mean that his favour and presence supplyall good to the inhabitants of that blessed world. The devil has nopower there; he cannot draw the saints from serving God, nor can hedisturb them in the service of God. God and the Lamb are here spoken ofas one. Service there shall be not only freedom, but honour anddominion. There will be no night; no affliction or dejection, no pausein service or enjoyment: no diversions or pleasures or man's inventingwill there be wanted. How different all this from gross and merelyhuman views of heavenly happiness, even those which refer to pleasuresof the mind!
Rev 22:6-19	<br>The Lord Jesus spake by the angel, solemnly confirming the contents ofthis book, particularly of this last vision. He is the Lord Godfaithful and true. Also by his messengers; the holy angels showed themto holy men of God. They are things that must shortly be done; Christwill come quickly, and put all things out of doubt. And by theintegrity of that angel who had been the apostle's interpreter. Herefused to accept religious worship from John, and reproved him foroffering it. This presents another testimony against idolatrous worshipof saints and angels. God calls every one to witness to thedeclarations here made. This book, thus kept open, will have effectupon men; the filthy and unjust will be more so, but it will confirm,strengthen, and further sanctify those who are upright with God. Neverlet us think that a dead or disobedient faith will save us, for theFirst and the Last has declared that those alone are blessed who do hiscommandments. It is a book that shuts out form heaven all wicked andunrighteous persons, particularly those who love and make lies,therefore cannot itself be a lie. There is no middle place orcondition. Jesus, who is the Spirit of prophecy, has given his churchesthis morning-light of prophecy, to assure them of the light of theperfect day approaching. All is confirmed by an open and generalinvitation to mankind, to come and partake freely of the promises andof the privileges of the gospel. The Spirit, by the sacred word, and byconvictions and influence in the sinner's conscience, says, Come toChrist for salvation; and the bride, or the whole church, on earth andin heaven, says, Come and share our happiness. Lest any shouldhesitate, it is added, Let whosoever will, or, is willing, come andtake of the water of life freely. May every one who hears or readsthese words, desire at once to accept the gracious invitation. All arecondemned who should dare to corrupt or change the word of God, eitherby adding to it, or taking from it.
Rev 22:20,21	<br>After discovering these things to his people on earth, Christ seems totake leave of them, and return to heaven; but he assures them it shallnot be long before he comes again. And while we are busy in the dutiesof our different stations of life; whatever labours may try us,whatever difficulties may surround us, whatever sorrows may press usdown, let us with pleasure hear our Lord proclaiming, Behold, I comequickly; I come to put an end to the labour and suffering of myservants. I come, and my reward of grace is with me, to recompense,with royal bounty, every work of faith and labour of love. I come toreceive my faithful, persevering people to myself, to dwell for ever inthat blissful world. Amen, even so, come, Lord Jesus. A blessing closesthe whole. By the grace of Christ we must be kept in joyful expectationof his glory, fitted for it, and preserved to it; and his gloriousappearance will be joyful to those who partake of his grace and favourhere. Let all add, Amen. Let us earnestly thirst after greater measuresof the gracious influences of the blessed Jesus in our souls, and hisgracious presence with us, till glory has made perfect his grace towardus. Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Ghost; asit was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be, world without end.Amen.
