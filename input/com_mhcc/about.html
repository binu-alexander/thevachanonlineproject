	<b>The Treasury of Scripture Knowledge, Enhanced</b><b> and Expanded</b><br>
	<br>
	This edition of <b>Treasury of Scripture Knowledge</b> (TSKe) is a
	newly enhanced and expanded edition of this valuable resource. Of all
	the commentaries, notes, outlines, etc. that have been printed as aids
	to Bible study and research, this resource is arguably the most
	valuable; it allows the Bible to explain and interpret itself. The
	Bible is its own best interpreter, and the <i>Bible Analyzer TSKe</i>
	module reveals the most relevant cross-references<b> </b>of any verse
	with a single mouse-click.
