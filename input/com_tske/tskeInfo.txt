<b>The Treasury of Scripture Knowledge, Enhanced</b><b> and Expanded</b><br>
<br>
This edition of <b>Treasury of Scripture Knowledge</b> (TSKe) is a
newly enhanced and expanded edition of this valuable resource. Of all
the commentaries, notes, outlines, etc. that have been printed as aids
to Bible study and research, this resource is arguably the most
valuable; it allows the Bible to explain and interpret itself. The
Bible is its own best interpreter, and the <i>Bible Analyzer TSKe</i>
module reveals the most relevant cross-references<b> </b>of any verse
with a single mouse-click.<b><br>
</b><br>
The Lord allowed us at BibleAnalyzer.com to greatly expanded the
standard TSK primarily by, <br>
<br>
<ul>
<li><i>Making Essentially All Cross-References Reciprocal</i></li>
<li><i>Adding Reference Headings to Reciprocal References</i></li>
<li><i>Adding References to Verses that Previously had None</i></li>
<li><i>Correcting Malformed and Orphaned References</i></li>
<li><i>and More.</i></li>
</ul>
<br>
<br>
By <i>reciprocal references</i> we mean references that mutually refer
to each other.<br>
<br>

</b>Apart from the <b>Authorized Version</b> of the Bible itself and a
good <b>English Dictionary</b>, we believe the <b>Treasury of
Scripture Knowledge, Enhanced</b> is the most valuable Bible study
resource one
can posses. <b><br>
<br>
<br>
About </b><b>The Original Treasury of Scripture Knowledge</b><br>
<b><br>
The Treasury of Scripture Knowledge</b> is a tool for interpreting
Scripture with Scripture. Each verse of the Bible is cross-referenced
to several others to enable the reader to gain a true sense of each
word and phrase as it is used in the Bible. There are over 500,000
(actually 382,000) cross-references, listing verses that illustrate how
words and phrases are used elsewhere in the Bible. This valuable
resource greatly aids the reader in interpreting Scripture with
Scripture. It contains brief chapter summaries with dates and other
notes. Originally printed in a 700+ page book, the entire reference is
available within this module. With a single click next to any verse in
the Bible, you have instant access to the most exhaustive
cross-reference list available.<br>
<br>
Going through the Scriptures with the aid of The Treasury will enable
the reader, better than all the commentaries, to come to a true
knowledge of God's meaning. As has been said, <i>"There is no other
commentary on the Bible so helpful as the Bible itself."</i> There is
not a difficult passage in the Bible that is not explained and made
clear by other passages of the Bible, and this book is marvelously
useful in bringing to light those other parts of the Bible that throw
light upon the portion that is being studied.<br>
<i><br>
"...The Treasury of Scripture Knowledge enables one, not only to
understand the Word, but to feed upon the Word."</i><br>
R. A. Torrey, from
the Introduction.<br>
