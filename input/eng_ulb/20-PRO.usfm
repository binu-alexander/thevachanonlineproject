\p
\v 1 The proverbs of Solomon son of David, the king of Israel.
\q
\v 2 These proverbs are to teach wisdom and instruction,
\q to teach words of insight,
\q
\v 3 that you may receive instruction in order to live
\q by doing what is right, just, and fair.
\s5
\q
\v 4 These proverbs are also to give wisdom to the naive,
\q and to give knowledge and discretion to young people.
\q
\v 5 Let wise people listen and increase their learning,
\q and let discerning people get guidance,
\q
\v 6 to understand proverbs, sayings,
\q and words of wise people and their riddles.
\s5
\q
\v 7 The fear of Yahweh is the beginning of knowledge—
\q fools despise wisdom and instruction.
\q
\v 8 My son, hear the instruction of your father
\q and do not lay aside the rules of your mother;
\q
\v 9 they will be a graceful wreath for your head
\q and pendants hanging from your neck.
\s5
\q
\v 10 My son, if sinners try to entice you into their sin,
\q refuse to follow them.
\q
\v 11 If they say, "Come with us,
\q let us lie in wait for blood,
\q let us hide and attack innocent people for no reason.
\s5
\q
\v 12 Let us swallow them up alive, like Sheol takes away those who are healthy,
\q and make them like those who fall into the pit.
\q
\v 13 We shall find all kinds of valuable things;
\q we will fill our houses with what we steal from others.
\q
\v 14 Throw in your lot with us;
\q we will all have one purse together."
\s5
\q
\v 15 My son, do not walk down that road with them;
\q do not let your foot touch where they walk;
\q
\v 16 their feet run to evil
\q and they hurry to shed blood.
\q
\v 17 For it is useless to spread the net in the sight of any bird.
\s5
\q
\v 18 These men lie in wait for their own blood—
\q they set an ambush for their own lives.
\q
\v 19 So are the ways of everyone who gains riches by injustice;
\q unjust gain takes away the lives of those who hold on to it.
\s5
\q
\v 20 Wisdom cries aloud in the street,
\q she raises her voice in the open places;
\q
\v 21 at the head of the noisy streets she cries out,
\q at the entrance of the city gates she speaks,
\q
\v 22 "How long, you naive people, will you love being naive?
\q How long, you mockers, will you delight in mockery,
\q and how long, you fools, will you hate knowledge?
\s5
\q
\v 23 Pay attention to my correction;
\q I will pour out my thoughts to you;
\q I will make my words known to you.
\q
\v 24 I have called, and you have refused to listen;
\q I reached out with my hand, but there was no one who paid attention.
\q
\v 25 But you have ignored all my instruction
\q and paid no attention to my correction.
\s5
\q
\v 26 I will laugh at your calamity,
\q I will mock you when the terror comes—
\q
\v 27 when your fearful dread comes like a storm
\q and disaster sweeps over you like a whirlwind,
\q when distress and anguish come upon you.
\s5
\q
\v 28 Then they will call upon me, and I will not answer;
\q they will desperately call for me, but they will not find me.
\q
\v 29 Because they hate knowledge
\q and did not choose the fear of Yahweh,
\q
\v 30 they would not follow my instruction,
\q and they despised all my correction.
\s5
\q
\v 31 They will eat the fruit of their ways,
\q and with the fruit of their schemes they will be filled.
\q
\v 32 For the naive are killed when they turn away,
\q and the indifference of fools will destroy them.
\q
\v 33 But whoever listens to me will live in safety
\q and will rest secure with no fear of disaster."
\s5
\c 2
\q
\v 1 My son, if you receive my words
\q and treasure up my commandments with you,
\q
\v 2 make your ears pay attention to wisdom
\q and incline your heart to understanding.
\s5
\q
\v 3 If you cry out for understanding
\q and raise your voice for it,
\q
\v 4 if you seek it like you would seek silver
\q and search for understanding as you would seek hidden treasures,
\q
\v 5 then you will understand the fear of Yahweh
\q and you will find the knowledge of God.
\s5
\q
\v 6 For Yahweh gives wisdom,
\q from his mouth comes knowledge and understanding.
\q
\v 7 He stores up sound wisdom for those who please him,
\q he is a shield for those who walk in integrity,
\q
\v 8 he guards the paths of justice
\q and he will preserve the way of those who are faithful to him.
\s5
\q
\v 9 Then you will understand righteousness, justice, and equity,
\q and every good path.
\q
\v 10 For wisdom will come into your heart,
\q and knowledge will be pleasant to your soul.
\s5
\q
\v 11 Discretion will watch over you,
\q understanding will guard you.
\q
\v 12 They will rescue you from the way of evil,
\q from those who speak perverse things,
\q
\v 13 who abandon the right paths
\q and walk in the ways of darkness.
\s5
\q
\v 14 They rejoice when they do evil
\q and delight in the perversities of evil.
\q
\v 15 They follow crooked paths,
\q and using deception they hide their tracks.
\s5
\q
\v 16 Wisdom and discretion will save you from an adulterous woman,
\q from an immoral woman and her flattering words.
\q
\v 17 She forsakes the companion of her youth
\q and forgets the covenant of her God.
\s5
\q
\v 18 For her house sinks down to death,
\q and her tracks will lead you to those in the grave.
\q
\v 19 All who go in to her will not return again
\q and they will not find the paths of life.
\s5
\q
\v 20 So you will walk in the way of good people
\q and follow the paths of righteous people.
\q
\v 21 For those doing right will make a home in the land,
\q and those with integrity will remain in it.
\q
\v 22 But the wicked will be cut off from the land,
\q and the faithless will be cut off from it.
\s5
\c 3
\q
\v 1 My son, do not forget my commands
\q and keep my teachings in your heart,
\q
\v 2 for length of days and years of life
\q and peace they will add to you.
\s5
\q
\v 3 Do not let covenant faithfulness and trustworthiness ever leave you,
\q tie them together about your neck,
\q write them on the tablet of your heart.
\q
\v 4 Then you will find favor and a good reputation
\q in the sight of God and man.
\s5
\q
\v 5 Trust in Yahweh with all your heart
\q and do not lean on your own understanding;
\q
\v 6 in all your ways acknowledge him
\q and he will make your paths straight.
\s5
\q
\v 7 Do not be wise in your own eyes;
\q fear Yahweh and turn away from evil.
\q
\v 8 It will be healing to your flesh
\q and refreshment for your body.
\s5
\q
\v 9 Honor Yahweh with your wealth
\q and with the firstfruits of all your produce,
\q
\v 10 and your storehouses will be filled up
\q and your vats will be bursting, full of new wine.
\s5
\q
\v 11 My son, do not despise Yahweh's instruction
\q and do not hate his rebuke,
\q
\v 12 for Yahweh disciplines those he loves,
\q as a father deals with a son who pleases him.
\s5
\q
\v 13 The one who finds wisdom is blessed;
\q he also gets understanding.
\q
\v 14 What you gain from wisdom is better than what silver will give in return
\q and its profit is better than gold.
\s5
\q
\v 15 Wisdom is more precious than jewels
\q and nothing you desire can compare to her.
\q
\v 16 She has length of days in her right hand;
\q in her left hand are riches and honor.
\s5
\q
\v 17 Her ways are ways of kindness
\q and all her paths are peace.
\q
\v 18 She is a tree of life to those who take hold of it,
\q those who hold on to it are happy.
\s5
\q
\v 19 By wisdom Yahweh founded the earth,
\q by understanding he established the heavens.
\q
\v 20 By his knowledge the depths broke open
\q and the clouds dropped their dew.
\s5
\q
\v 21 My son, keep sound judgment and discernment,
\q and do not lose sight of them.
\q
\v 22 They will be life to your soul
\q and an adornment of favor to wear around your neck.
\s5
\q
\v 23 Then you will walk on your way in safety
\q and your foot will not stumble;
\q
\v 24 when you lie down, you will not be afraid;
\q when you lie down, your sleep will be sweet.
\s5
\q
\v 25 Do not be afraid of sudden terror
\q or devastation caused by the wicked, when it comes,
\q
\v 26 for Yahweh will be on your side
\q and will keep your foot from being caught in a trap.
\s5
\q
\v 27 Do not withhold good from those who deserve it,
\q when it is in your power to act.
\q
\v 28 Do not say to your neighbor,
\q "Go, and come again, and tomorrow I will give it,"
\q when you have the money with you.
\s5
\q
\v 29 Do not make a plan to harm your neighbor—
\q the one who lives close and trusts you.
\q
\v 30 Do not argue with a person without a reason,
\q when he has done nothing to harm you.
\s5
\q
\v 31 Do not envy a violent person
\q or choose any of his ways.
\q
\v 32 For the devious person is detestable to Yahweh,
\q but he brings the upright person into his confidence.
\s5
\q
\v 33 The curse of Yahweh is on the house of the wicked person,
\q but he blesses the home of righteous people.
\q
\v 34 He mocks mockers,
\q but he gives his favor to humble people.
\s5
\q
\v 35 Wise people inherit honor,
\q but fools will be lifted up in their shame.
\s5
\c 4
\q
\v 1 Listen, sons, to a father's instruction,
\q and pay attention so you will know what understanding is.
\q
\v 2 I am giving you good instructions;
\q do not forsake my teaching.
\s5
\q
\v 3 When I was a son of my father,
\q the tender and only child of my mother,
\q
\v 4 he taught me and said to me,
\q "Let your heart hold fast to my words;
\q keep my commands and live.
\s5
\q
\v 5 Acquire wisdom and understanding;
\q do not forget and do not reject the words of my mouth;
\q
\v 6 do not abandon wisdom and she will watch over you;
\q love her and she will keep you safe.
\s5
\q
\v 7 Wisdom is the most important thing, so acquire wisdom
\q and spend all you own so you can get understanding.
\q
\v 8 Cherish wisdom and she will exalt you;
\q she will honor you when you embrace her.
\q
\v 9 She will put a wreath of honor on your head;
\q she will give you a beautiful crown."
\s5
\q
\v 10 Listen, my son, and pay attention to my words,
\q and you will have many years in your life.
\q
\v 11 I direct you in the way of wisdom;
\q I lead you down straight paths.
\q
\v 12 When you walk, no one will stand in your way
\q and if you run, you will not stumble.
\s5
\q
\v 13 Hold on to instruction, do not let it go;
\q guard it, for it is your life.
\q
\v 14 Do not follow the path of the wicked
\q and do not go along the way of those who do evil.
\q
\v 15 Avoid it, do not go on it;
\q turn away from it and go another way.
\s5
\q
\v 16 For they cannot sleep until they do evil
\q and they are robbed of sleep until they cause someone to stumble.
\q
\v 17 For they eat the bread of wickedness
\q and drink the wine of violence.
\s5
\q
\v 18 But the path of righteous people is like the first light that grows brighter;
\q it shines more and more until the fullness of the day comes.
\q
\v 19 The way of the wicked is like darkness—
\q they do not know what it is they stumble over.
\s5
\q
\v 20 My son, pay attention to my words;
\q incline your ear to my sayings.
\q
\v 21 Do not let them turn away from your eyes;
\q keep them in your heart.
\s5
\q
\v 22 For my words are life to those who find them
\q and health to their whole body.
\q
\v 23 Keep your heart safe and guard it with all diligence,
\q for from it flow the springs of life.
\s5
\q
\v 24 Put crooked speech away from you
\q and put corrupt talk far from you.
\q
\v 25 Let your eyes look straight ahead
\q and fix your gaze straight before you.
\s5
\q
\v 26 Make a level path for your foot;
\q then all your ways will be secure.
\q
\v 27 Do not turn aside to the right or to the left;
\q turn your foot away from evil.
\s5
\c 5
\q
\v 1 My son, pay attention to my wisdom;
\q incline your ears to my understanding,
\q
\v 2 so you may learn about discretion
\q and your lips may protect knowledge.
\s5
\q
\v 3 For the lips of an adulteress drip with honey
\q and her mouth is smoother than oil,
\q
\v 4 but in the end she is as bitter as wormwood,
\q cutting like a sharp sword.
\s5
\q
\v 5 Her feet go down to death;
\q her steps go all the way to Sheol.
\q
\v 6 She gives no thought to the path of life.
\q Her footsteps wander; she does not know where she is going.
\s5
\q
\v 7 Now, my sons, listen to me;
\q do not turn away from listening to the words of my mouth.
\q
\v 8 Keep your path far away from her
\q and do not come near the door of her house.
\s5
\q
\v 9 In that way you will not give away your honor to others
\q or years of your life to a cruel person;
\q
\v 10 strangers will not feast on your wealth;
\q what you have worked for will not go into the house of strangers.
\s5
\q
\v 11 At the end of your life you will groan
\q when your flesh and your body waste away.
\q
\v 12 You will say, "How I hated instruction
\q and my heart despised correction!
\s5
\q
\v 13 I would not obey my teachers
\q or incline my ear to my instructors.
\q
\v 14 I was almost completely ruined
\q in the midst of the assembly, among the gathering of the people."
\s5
\q
\v 15 Drink water from your own cistern
\q and drink running water from your own well.
\q
\v 16 Should your springs overflow everywhere
\q and your streams of water flow in the public squares?
\q
\v 17 Let them be for yourself alone
\q and not for strangers with you.
\s5
\q
\v 18 May your fountain be blessed
\q and may you rejoice in the wife of your youth,
\q
\v 19 for she is a loving deer and a graceful doe.
\q Let her breasts satisfy you at all times;
\q may you be continually intoxicated by her love.
\s5
\q
\v 20 For why should you, my son, be captivated by an adulteress;
\q why should you embrace the breasts of an immoral woman?
\q
\v 21 Yahweh sees everything a person does
\q and watches all the paths he takes.
\s5
\q
\v 22 A wicked person will be seized by his own iniquities;
\q the cords of his sin will hold him tight.
\q
\v 23 He will die because he lacks instruction;
\q he is led astray by his great foolishness.
\s5
\c 6
\q
\v 1 My son, if you set aside your money as a guarantee for your neighbor's loan,
\q if you gave your promise for a loan of someone you do not know,
\q
\v 2 then you have laid a trap for yourself by your promise
\q and you have been caught by the words of your mouth.
\s5
\q
\v 3 When you are caught by your words, my son, do this and save yourself,
\q since you have fallen into the hand of your neighbor;
\q go and humble yourself and make your case before your neighbor.
\s5
\q
\v 4 Give your eyes no sleep
\q and your eyelids no slumber.
\q
\v 5 Save yourself like a gazelle from the hand of the hunter,
\q like a bird from the hand of the fowler.
\s5
\q
\v 6 Look at the ant, you lazy person,
\q consider her ways, and be wise.
\q
\v 7 It has no commander,
\q officer, or ruler,
\q
\v 8 yet it prepares its food in the summer
\q and during the harvest it stores up what it will eat.
\s5
\q
\v 9 How long will you sleep, you lazy person?
\q When will you rise from your sleep?
\q
\v 10 "A little sleep, a little slumber,
\q a little folding of the hands to rest"—
\q
\v 11 and your poverty will come like a robber
\q and your needs like an armed soldier.
\s5
\q
\v 12 A worthless person—a wicked man—
\q lives by the crookedness of his speech,
\q
\v 13 winking his eyes, making signals with his feet
\q and pointing with his fingers.
\s5
\q
\v 14 He plots evil with deceit in his heart;
\q he always stirs up discord.
\q
\v 15 Therefore his disaster will overtake him in an instant;
\q in a moment he will be broken beyond healing.
\s5
\q
\v 16 There are six things that Yahweh hates,
\q seven that are disgusting to him.
\q
\s5
\v 17 The eyes of a proud person, a tongue that lies,
\q hands that shed the blood of innocent people,
\q
\v 18 a heart that invents wicked schemes,
\q feet that quickly run to do evil,
\q
\v 19 a witness who breathes out lies
\q and one who sows discord among brothers.
\s5
\q
\v 20 My son, obey the command of your father
\q and do not forsake the teaching of your mother.
\q
\v 21 Always bind them on your heart;
\q tie them about your neck.
\s5
\q
\v 22 When you walk, they will guide you;
\q when you sleep, they will watch over you;
\q and when you wake up, they will teach you.
\q
\v 23 For the commands are a lamp, and the teaching is a light;
\q the corrections that come by instruction are the way of life.
\s5
\q
\v 24 It keeps you from the immoral woman,
\q from the smooth words of an immoral woman.
\q
\v 25 Do not lust in your heart after her beauty
\q and do not let her capture you with her eyelashes.
\s5
\q
\v 26 Sleeping with a prostitute can cost the price of a loaf of bread,
\q but the wife of another may cost you your very life.
\q
\v 27 Can a man carry a fire against his chest
\q without burning his clothes?
\s5
\q
\v 28 Can a man walk on hot coals
\q without scorching his feet?
\q
\v 29 So is the man who goes in to his neighbor's wife;
\q the one who touches her will not go unpunished.
\s5
\q
\v 30 People do not despise a thief if he steals
\q to satisfy his need when he is hungry.
\q
\v 31 Yet if he is caught, he will pay back seven times what he stole;
\q he must give up everything of value in his house.
\s5
\q
\v 32 The one who commits adultery has no sense;
\q the one who does it destroys himself.
\q
\v 33 Wounds and shame are what he deserves
\q and his disgrace will not be wiped away.
\s5
\q
\v 34 For jealousy makes a man furious;
\q he will show no mercy when he takes his revenge.
\q
\v 35 He will accept no compensation
\q and he cannot be bought off, though you offer him many gifts.
\s5
\c 7
\q
\v 1 My son, keep my words
\q and store up my commands within yourself.
\q
\v 2 Keep my commands and live
\q and keep my instruction as the apple of your eye.
\q
\v 3 Tie them on your fingers;
\q write them on the tablet of your heart.
\s5
\q
\v 4 Say to wisdom, "You are my sister,"
\q and call understanding your kinsman,
\q
\v 5 in order to keep yourself from the adulterous woman,
\q from the immoral woman with her smooth words.
\s5
\q
\v 6 At the window of my house
\q I was looking out through the lattice.
\q
\v 7 I looked at the naive people,
\q and I noticed among the young men
\q a youth who had no sense.
\s5
\q
\v 8 That young man passed down the street near her corner,
\q and he went toward her house.
\q
\v 9 It was twilight, in the evening of the day,
\q at the time of night and darkness.
\s5
\q
\v 10 There a woman met him,
\q dressed like a prostitute, with a false heart.
\q
\v 11 She was loud and wayward;
\q her feet did not stay at home.
\q
\v 12 Now in the streets, then in the market place,
\q and at every corner she waited in ambush.
\s5
\q
\v 13 So she grabbed him and kissed him,
\q with a strong face she said to him,
\q
\v 14 "I made my peace offering today,
\q I paid my vows,
\q
\v 15 so came I out to meet you,
\q to eagerly seek your face, and I have found you.
\s5
\q
\v 16 I have spread coverings on my bed,
\q colored linens from Egypt.
\q
\v 17 I have sprinkled my bed
\q with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon.
\q
\v 18 Come, let us drink our fill of love until morning;
\q let us take great pleasure in acts of love.
\s5
\q
\v 19 For my husband is not at his house;
\q he has gone on a long journey.
\q
\v 20 He took a bag of money with him;
\q he will return on the day of the full moon."
\q
\v 21 With much talk she turned him;
\q with her smooth lips she misled him.
\s5
\q
\v 22 He went after her suddenly
\q like an ox going to slaughter,
\q like a deer caught in a trap,  
\f † Deer could be a stag or an antelope. The Vulgate has: lamb . The LXX has: like a dog to the muzzle . \f*
\q
\v 23 until an arrow pierces through its liver.
\q He was like a bird rushing into a snare.
\q He did not know that it would cost his life.
\s5
\q
\v 24 Now, my sons, listen to me;
\q pay attention to the words of my mouth.
\q
\v 25 May your heart not turn aside onto her paths;
\q do not be led astray onto her paths.
\s5
\q
\v 26 She has caused many people to fall down pierced;
\q her dead victims are very many.
\q
\v 27 Her house is on the paths to Sheol;
\q they go down to the dark bedrooms of death.
\s5
\c 8
\q
\v 1 Does not Wisdom call out?
\q Does not Understanding raise her voice?
\q
\v 2 On the hilltops beside the road,
\q at the crossroads, Wisdom has taken her stand.
\q
\v 3 Before the gates at the entrance into the city,
\q at the entrances into the city, she calls out.
\s5
\q
\v 4 "It is to you, people, that I call;
\q my voice is for the sons of mankind.
\q
\v 5 You who are naive, learn wisdom;
\q and you who are foolish, you must get an understanding mind.
\s5
\q
\v 6 Listen, because I will speak of noble things,
\q and when my lips open I will say upright things.
\q
\v 7 For my mouth speaks what is trustworthy,
\q and wickedness is disgusting to my lips.
\s5
\q
\v 8 All the words of my mouth are just;
\q in them is nothing twisted or misleading.
\q
\v 9 All of them are straight for the person who understands;
\q my words are upright for those who find knowledge.
\s5
\q
\v 10 Acquire my instruction rather than silver;
\q acquire knowledge rather than pure gold.
\q
\v 11 For Wisdom is better than jewels;
\q no treasure is equal to her.
\s5
\q
\v 12 I, Wisdom, live with Prudence,
\q and I possess knowledge and discretion.
\q
\v 13 The fear of Yahweh is to hate evil.
\q I hate pride and arrogance, the evil way,
\q and perverted speech. I hate them.
\s5
\q
\v 14 I have good advice and sound wisdom;
\q I am insight; strength belongs to me.
\q
\v 15 By me kings reign, and rulers make laws that are just.
\q
\v 16 By me princes rule,
\q nobles, and all who govern with justice.
\s5
\q
\v 17 I love those who love me,
\q and those who diligently seek me, find me.
\q
\v 18 With me are riches and honor,
\q lasting wealth and righteousness.
\s5
\q
\v 19 My fruit is better than gold, even fine gold;
\q my produce is better than pure silver.
\q
\v 20 I walk in the path of righteousness,
\q in the midst of the paths of justice.
\q
\v 21 As a result, I make those who love me inherit wealth;
\q I fill up their treasuries.
\s5
\q
\v 22 Yahweh created me at the beginning,
\q the first of his deeds then.
\q
\v 23 In ages long ago I was made—from the first,
\q from the beginnings of the earth.
\s5
\q
\v 24 Before there were oceans, I was given birth—
\q before there were springs abounding with water.
\q
\v 25 Before the mountains were settled
\q and before the hills, I was born.

\q
\v 7 When a person's ways are pleasing to Yahweh,
\q he makes even that person's enemies to be at peace with him.
\q
\v 8 Better is a little with what is right,
\q than a large income with injustice.
\s5
\q
\v 9 In his heart a person plans out his way,
\q but Yahweh directs his steps.
\q
\v 10 Insightful decisions are on the lips of a king,
\q his mouth should not betray justice. 
\s5
\q
\v 11 Honest scales come from Yahweh;
\q all the weights in the bag are his work.
\q
\v 12 When kings do wicked things, that is something to be despised,
\q for a throne is established by doing what is right.
\s5
\q
\v 13 A king delights in lips that say what is right
\q and he loves the one who speaks directly.
\q
\v 14 A king's wrath is a messenger of death
\q but a wise man will try to calm his anger.
\s5
\q
\v 15 In the light of a king's face is life
\q and his favor is like a cloud that brings a spring rain.
\q
\v 16 How much better it is to get wisdom than gold.
\q To get understanding should be chosen more than silver.
\s5
\q
\v 17 The highway of upright people turns away from evil;
\q the one who protects his life guards his way.
\q
\v 18 Pride comes before destruction
\q and a haughty spirit before a downfall.
\s5
\q
\v 19 It is better to be humble among poor people
\q than to divide the spoil with proud people.
\q
\v 20 Whoever contemplates what they are taught will find what is good,
\q and those who trust in Yahweh will be blessed.
\s5
\q
\v 21 The one who is wise in heart is called discerning
\q and sweetness of speech improves the ability to teach.
\q
\v 22 Understanding is a fountain of life to the one who has it,
\q but the instruction of fools is their foolishness.
\s5
\q
\v 23 The heart of a wise person gives insight to his mouth
\q and adds persuasiveness to his lips.
\q
\v 24 Pleasant words are a honeycomb—
\q sweet to the soul and healing to the bones.
\s5
\q
\v 25 There is a way that seems right to a man,
\q but its end is the way to death.
\q
\v 26 The laborer's appetite works for him;
\q his hunger urges him on.
\s5
\q
\v 27 A worthless person digs up mischief
\q and his speech is like a scorching fire.
\q
\v 28 A perverse person stirs up conflict
\q and a gossip separates close friends.
\s5
\q
\v 29 A man of violence lies to his neighbor
\q and leads him down a path that is not good.
\q
\v 30 The one who winks the eye is plotting perverse things;
\q those who purse the lips will bring evil to pass.
\s5
\q
\v 31 Gray hair is a crown of glory;
\q it is gained by living the right way.
\q
\v 32 It is better to be slow to anger than to be a warrior
\q and one who rules his spirit is stronger than one who conquers a city.
\s5
\q
\v 33 The lots are cast into the lap,
\q but the decision is from Yahweh.
\s5
\c 17
\q
\v 1 It is better to have quiet with a dry morsel of bread
\q than a house full of feasting with strife.
\q
\v 2 A wise servant will rule over a son who acts shamefully
\q and will share the inheritance as one of the brothers.
\s5
\q
\v 3 The crucible is for silver and the furnace is for gold,
\q but Yahweh refines hearts.
\q
\v 4 The evildoer pays attention to wicked lips;
\q a liar gives ear to a destructive tongue.
\s5
\q
\v 5 Whoever mocks the poor insults his Maker
\q and the one who rejoices at misfortune will not go unpunished.
\q
\v 6 Grandchildren are the crown of the aged
\q and parents bring honor to their children.
\s5
\q
\v 7 Eloquent speech is not suitable for a fool;
\q much less are lying lips suitable for royalty.
\q
\v 8 A bribe is like a magic stone to the one who gives it;
\q wherever he turns, he succeeds.
\s5
\q
\v 9 Whoever overlooks an offense seeks love,
\q but the one who repeats a matter alienates close friends.
\q
\v 10 A rebuke goes deeper into a person who has understanding
\q than a hundred blows go into a fool.
\s5
\q
\v 11 An evil person only seeks rebellion,
\q so a cruel messenger will be sent against him.
\q
\v 12 It is better to meet a bear robbed of her cubs
\q than to meet a fool in his foolishness.
\s5
\q
\v 13 When someone returns evil for good,
\q evil will never leave his house.
\q
\v 14 The beginning of conflict is like one who releases water everywhere,
\q so walk away from the dispute before it has broken out.
\s5
\q
\v 15 The person who acquits the wicked person and the person who condemns the righteous person—
\q both are an abomination to Yahweh.
\q
\v 16 Why should a fool pay money to learn about wisdom,
\q when he has no ability to learn it?
\s5
\q
\v 17 A friend is loving at all times
\q and a brother is born for times of trouble.
\q
\v 18 A man having no sense makes binding promises
\q and becomes responsible for his neighbor's debts.
\s5
\q
\v 19 Whoever loves conflict loves sin;
\q the one who makes the threshold of his door too high causes bones to be broken.
\q
\v 20 A person who has a crooked heart finds nothing that is good;
\q the one who has a perverse tongue falls into calamity.
\s5
\q
\v 21 Whoever is the parent of a fool brings grief to himself;
\q and the father of a fool has no joy.
\q
\v 22 A cheerful heart is good medicine,
\q but a broken spirit dries up the bones.
\s5
\q
\v 23 A wicked man accepts a secret bribe
\q to pervert the ways of justice.
\q
\v 24 The one who has understanding sets his face toward wisdom,
\q but the eyes of a fool are set on the ends of the earth.
\s5
\q
\v 25 A foolish son is a grief to his father
\q and bitterness to the woman who bore him.
\q
\v 26 Also, it is never good to punish the righteous person;
\q neither is it good to flog noble men who have integrity.
\s5
\q
\v 27 One who has knowledge uses few words
\q and one with understanding is even-tempered.
\q
\v 28 Even a fool is thought to be wise if he keeps silent;
\q when he keeps his mouth shut, he is considered to be intelligent.
\s5
\c 18
\q
\v 1 One who isolates himself seeks his own desire
\q and he quarrels with all sound judgment.
\q
\v 2 A fool finds no pleasure in understanding,
\q but only in revealing what is in his own heart.
\s5
\q
\v 3 When a wicked person comes, contempt comes with him—
\q along with shame and reproach.
\q
\v 4 The words of a man's mouth are deep waters;
\q the fountain of wisdom is a flowing stream.
 
\s5
\q
\v 5 It is not good to be partial to the wicked person,
\q nor to deny justice to the righteous person.
\q
\v 6 A fool's lips bring him conflict
\q and his mouth invites a beating.
\s5
\q
\v 7 A fool's mouth is his ruin
\q and he ensnares himself with his lips.
\q
\v 8 The words of a gossip are like delicious morsels
\q and they go down into the inner parts of the body.
\s5
\q
\v 9 Also, one who is slack in his work
\q is a brother to the one who destroys the most.
\q
\v 10 The name of Yahweh is a strong tower;
\q the righteous person runs into it and is safe.
\s5
\q
\v 11 The wealth of the rich is his fortified city
\q and in his imagination it is like a high wall.
\q
\v 12 Before his downfall a person's heart is proud,
\q but humility comes before honor.
\s5
\q
\v 13 One who answers before listening—
\q it is his folly and shame.
\q
\v 14 A person's spirit will survive sickness,
\q but a broken spirit who can bear it?
\s5
\q
\v 15 The heart of the intelligent acquires knowledge
\q and the hearing of the wise seeks it out.
\q
\v 16 A man's gift may open the way
\q and bring him before an important person.
\s5
\q
\v 17 The first to plead his case seems right
\q until his opponent comes and questions him.
\q
\v 18 Casting the lot settles disputes
\q and separates strong opponents.
\s5
\q
\v 19 An offended brother is harder to be won than a strong city,
\q and quarreling is like the bars of a castle.
\q
\v 20 From the fruit of his mouth one's stomach is filled;
\q with the harvest of his lips he is satisfied.
\s5
\q
\v 21 Death and life are controlled by the tongue,
\q and those who love the tongue will eat its fruit.
\q
\v 22 He who finds a wife finds a good thing
\q and receives favor from Yahweh.
\s5
\q
\v 23 A poor person pleads for mercy,
\q but a rich person answers harshly.
\q
\v 24 The one who claims many friends is brought to ruin by them,
\q but there is a friend who comes closer than a brother.
\s5
\c 19
\q
\v 1 Better is a poor person who walks in his integrity
\q than one who is perverse in speech and is a fool.
\q
\v 2 Also, it is not good to have desire without knowledge
\q and the one who runs too fast misses the path.
\s5
\q
\v 3 A person's folly ruins his life
\q and his heart rages against Yahweh.
\q
\v 4 Wealth adds many friends,
\q but a poor person is separated from his friends.
\s5
\q
\v 5 A false witness will not go unpunished
\q and he who breathes out lies will not escape.
\q
\v 6 Many will ask for a favor from a generous person
\q and everyone is a friend of the one who gives gifts.
\s5
\q
\v 7 All the brothers of a poor man hate him;
\q how much more do his friends who go far away from him!
\q He calls out to them, but they are gone.
\q
\v 8 He who gets wisdom loves his own life;
\q he who keeps understanding will find what is good.
\s5
\q
\v 9 A false witness will not go unpunished,
\q but the one who breathes out lies will perish.
\q
\v 10 It is not fitting for a fool to live in luxury—
\q much less for a slave to rule over princes.
\s5
\q
\v 11 Discretion makes a person slow to anger
\q and it is his glory to overlook an offense.
\q
\v 12 The wrath of the king is like the roaring of a young lion,
\q but his favor is like dew on the grass.
\s5
\q
\v 13 A foolish son is ruin to his father
\q and a quarreling wife is a constant dripping of water.
\q
\v 14 A house and wealth are inherited from parents,
\q but a prudent wife is from Yahweh.
\s5
\q
\v 15 Laziness throws a person into a deep sleep,
\q but the one not willing to work will go hungry.
\q
\v 16 The one who obeys the command guards his life,
\q but the person who does not think about his ways will die.
\s5
\q
\v 17 Whoever is kind to the poor lends to Yahweh
\q and he will repay him for what he has done.
\q
\v 18 Discipline your son while there is hope
\q and do not set your desire on putting him to death.
\s5
\q
\v 19 A hot-tempered person must pay the penalty;
\q if you rescue him, you will have to do it a second time.
\q
\v 20 Listen to advice and accept instruction,
\q so you may become wise by the end of your life.
\s5
\q
\v 21 Many are the plans in a person's heart,
\q but it is the purpose of Yahweh that will stand.
\q
\v 22 Loyalty is what a person desires
\q and a poor person is better than a liar.
\s5
\q
\v 23 Honor for Yahweh leads people to life;
\q anyone who has it will be satisfied
\q and not afflicted by harm.
\q
\v 24 The sluggard buries his hand in the dish;
\q he will not even bring it back up to his mouth.
\s5
\q
\v 25 Strike a mocker, and the naive person will become prudent;
\q discipline one who is discerning, and he will gain knowledge.
\s5
\q
\v 26 The one who robs his father and chases his mother away
\q is a son who brings shame and reproach.
\q
\v 27 If you cease to hear instruction, my son,
\q you will stray from the words of knowledge.
\s5
\q
\v 28 A corrupt witness mocks justice
\q and the mouth of the wicked swallows iniquity.
\q
\v 29 Condemnation is ready for mockers
\q and flogging for the backs of fools.
\s5
\c 20
\q
\v 1 Wine is a mocker and strong drink is a brawler;
\q whoever is led astray by drink is not wise.
\q
\v 2 The fear of a king is like the fear of a young lion that is roaring;
\q the one who makes him angry forfeits his life.
\s5
\q
\v 3 It is an honor for anyone to avoid conflict,
\q but every fool jumps into an argument.
\q
\v 4 The lazy person does not plow in autumn;
\q he seeks a crop at harvest time but will have nothing.
\s5
\q
\v 5 The purpose in a human heart is like deep water,
\q but someone with understanding will draw it out.
\q
\v 6 Many a person proclaims he is loyal,
\q but who can find one who is faithful?
\s5
\q
\v 7 The righteous person walks in his integrity,
\q and his sons who follow after him will be blessed.
\q
\v 8 A king who sits on the throne performing the duties of a judge
\q is winnowing with his eyes all the evil that is before him.
\s5
\q
\v 9 Who can say, "I have kept my heart pure;
\q I am clean from my sin"?
\q
\v 10 Differing weights and unequal measures—
\q Yahweh hates them both.
\s5
\q
\v 11 Even a youth is known by his actions,
\q by whether his conduct is pure and upright.
\q
\v 12 Ears that hear and eyes that see—
\q Yahweh made them both.
\s5
\q
\v 13 Do not love sleep or you will come to poverty;
\q open your eyes and you will have plenty to eat.
\q
\v 14 "Bad! Bad!" says the buyer,
\q but when he goes away he boasts.
\s5
\q
\v 15 There is gold and an abundance of costly stones,
\q but lips of knowledge are a precious jewel.
\q
\v 16 Take a garment of one who has put up security for a stranger,
\q and hold it in pledge when he puts up security for an immoral woman.
\s5
\q
\v 17 Bread gained by deceit tastes sweet,
\q but afterward his mouth will be full of gravel.
\q
\v 18 Plans are established by advice
\q and only with wise guidance should you wage war.
\s5
\q
\v 19 A gossip reveals secrets
\q and so you should not associate with people who talk too much.
\q
\v 20 If a person curses his father or his mother,
\q his lamp will be snuffed out in the middle of darkness.
\s5
\q
\v 21 An inheritance gained quickly at the beginning
\q will do less good in the end.
\q
\v 22 Do not say, "I will pay you back for this wrong!"
\q Wait for Yahweh and he will rescue you.
\s5
\q
\v 23 Yahweh hates unequal weights
\q and dishonest scales are not good.
\q
\v 24 A person's steps are directed by Yahweh;
\q how then can he understand his way?
\s5
\q
\v 25 It is a snare for a person to say rashly, "This thing is holy,"
\q and begin to think about what it means only after making his vow.
\q
\v 26 A wise king winnows the wicked
\q and he turns a threshing wheel over them.
\s5
\q
\v 27 The spirit of a person is the lamp of Yahweh,
\q searching all his inmost parts.
\q
\v 28 Covenant faithfulness and trustworthiness preserve the king;
\q his throne is made secure by love.
\s5
\q
\v 29 The glory of young men is their strength
\q and the splendor of old people is their gray hair.
\q
\v 30 Blows that make a wound cleanse away evil
\q and beatings make the innermost parts clean.
\s5
\c 21
\q
\v 1 The king's heart is a stream of water in the hand of Yahweh;
\q he turns it wherever he pleases.
\q
\v 2 Every person's way is right in his own eyes,
\q but it is Yahweh who weighs the hearts.
\s5
\q
\v 3 To do what is right and just
\q is more acceptable to Yahweh than sacrifice.
\q
\v 4 Haughty eyes and a proud heart—
\q the lamp of the wicked—are sin.
\s5
\q
\v 5 The plans of the diligent lead only to prosperity,
\q but everyone who acts too quickly comes only to poverty.
\q
\v 6 Acquiring riches by a lying tongue
\q is a fleeting vapor and a snare that kills.
\s5
\q
\v 7 The violence of the wicked will drag them away,
\q for they refuse to do what is just.
\q
\v 8 The way of a guilty person is crooked,
\q but the one who is pure does what is right.
\s5
\q
\v 9 It is better to live on a corner of the roof
\q than in a house shared with a quarrelsome wife.
\q
\v 10 The appetite of the wicked craves evil;
\q his neighbor finds no favor in his eyes. 
\s5
\q
\v 11 When the mocker is punished, the naive become wise,
\q and when the wise person is instructed, he lays hold of knowledge.
\q
\v 12 The righteous person watches the house of the wicked person;
\q he brings wicked people to disaster.
\s5
\q
\v 13 The one who shuts his ears to the cry of the poor,
\q he also will cry out, but he will not be answered.
\q
\v 14 A gift in secret appeases anger
\q and a concealed gift appeases strong wrath.
\s5
\q
\v 15 When justice is done, it brings joy to the righteous person,
\q but it brings terror to evildoers.
\q
\v 16 The one who wanders from the way of understanding,
\q he will rest in the assembly of the dead.
\s5
\q
\v 17 Whoever loves pleasure will become poor;
\q the one who loves wine and oil will not be rich.
\q
\v 18 A wicked person is ransom for the righteous person,
\q and the treacherous person is ransom for upright people.
\s5
\q
\v 19 It is better to live in the desert
\q than with a quarreling and angry wife. 
\q
\v 20 Desirable treasure and oil are kept in the dwelling of the wise, 
\q but a foolish person swallows it all up.
\s5
\q
\v 21 The one who does right and is kind—
\q this person finds life, righteousness, and honor.
\q
\v 22 A wise man scales the city of the mighty ones,
\q and he brings down the stronghold in which they trusted.
\s5
\q
\v 23 Whoever guards his mouth and tongue
\q keeps himself out of trouble.
\q
\v 24 The proud and haughty person—"Mocker" is his name—
\q acts with arrogant pride.
\s5
\q
\v 25 The desire of the lazy kills him,
\q for his hands refuse to work.
\q
\v 26 All day long he craves and craves more,
\q but the righteous person gives and does not hold back.
\s5
\q
\v 27 The sacrifice of the wicked is detestable;
\q it is even more detestable when he brings it with evil motives.
\q
\v 28 A false witness will perish,
\q but the one who listens will speak for all time.
\s5
\q
\v 29 A wicked man makes his face hard,
\q but an upright person is certain about his ways.
\f † Some modern versions have but an upright person thinks about his way . \f*
\s5
\q
\v 30 There is no wisdom, there is no understanding, and there is no advice
\q that can stand against Yahweh.
\q
\v 31 The horse is prepared for the day of battle,
\q but the victory belongs to Yahweh.
\s5
\c 22
\q
\v 1 A good name is to be chosen over great riches
\q and favor is better than silver and gold.
\q
\v 2 Rich and poor people have this in common—
\q Yahweh is the maker of all of them.
\s5
\q
\v 3 A prudent man sees trouble and hides himself,
\q but the naive go on and suffer because of it.
\q
\v 4 The reward for humility and fear of Yahweh
\q is riches, honor, and life.
\s5
\q
\v 5 Thorns and snares lie in the path of the perverse;
\q whoever guards his life will keep far from them.
\q
\v 6 Teach a child the way he should go
\q and when he is old he will not turn away from that instruction.
\s5
\q
\v 7 Rich people rule over poor people
\q and one who borrows is a slave to the one who lends.
\q
\v 8 He who sows injustice will reap trouble
\q and the rod of his fury will fade away.
\s5
\q
\v 9 The one who has a generous eye will be blessed,
\q for he shares his bread with the poor.
\q
\v 10 Drive away the mocker, and out goes strife;
\q disputes and insults will cease.
\s5
\q
\v 11 The one who loves a pure heart
\q and whose speech is gracious,
\q he will have the king for his friend.
\q
\v 12 The eyes of Yahweh keep watch over knowledge,
\q but he overthrows the words of the treacherous.
\s5
\q
\v 13 The lazy person says, "There is a lion in the street!
\q I will be killed in the open places."
\q
\v 14 The mouth of an adulteress is a deep pit;
\q Yahweh's anger is stirred up against anyone who falls into it.
\s5
\q
\v 15 Foolishness is bound up in the heart of a child,
\q but the rod of discipline drives it far away.
\q
\v 16 The one who oppresses poor people to increase his wealth,
\q or gives to rich people, will come to poverty.
\s5
\q
\v 17 Incline your ear and listen to the words of the wise
\q and apply your heart to my knowledge,
\q
\v 18 for it will be pleasant for you if you keep them within you,
\q if all of them are ready on your lips.
\q
\v 19 So your trust may be in Yahweh,
\q I teach them to you today—even to you.
\s5
\q
\v 20 Have I not written for you thirty sayings
\q of instruction and knowledge,
\q
\v 21 to teach you truth in these trustworthy words,
\q so you may give trustworthy answers to those who sent you?
\s5
\q
\v 22 Do not rob the poor because he is poor,
\q or crush the needy at the gate,
\q
\v 23 for Yahweh will plead their case,
\q and he will rob of life those who robbed them.
\s5
\q
\v 24 Do not make a friend of someone who is ruled by anger
\q and you must not go with one who rages,
\q
\v 25 or you will learn his ways
\q and you will take bait for your soul.
\s5
\q
\v 26 Do not be one who strikes hands in making a pledge,
\q or who puts up security for debts.
\q
\v 27 If you lack the means to pay,
\q what could stop someone from taking away your bed from under you?
\s5
\q
\v 28 Do not remove the ancient boundary stone
\q that your fathers have set.
\q
\v 29 Do you see a man skilled at his work? He will stand before kings;
\q he will not stand before common people.
\s5
\c 23
\q
\v 1 When you sit to eat with a ruler,
\q observe carefully what is before you,
\q
\v 2 and put a knife to your throat
\q if you are a person who likes to eat a lot of food.
\q
\v 3 Do not crave his delicacies,
\q for it is the food of lies.
\s5
\q
\v 4 Do not work too hard to gain wealth;
\q be wise enough to know when to stop.
\q
\v 5 Will you let your eyes light upon it?
\q It will be gone,
\q for it will surely take up wings like an eagle
\q and fly off to the sky.
\s5
\q
\v 6 Do not eat the food of one with an evil eye—
\q and do not crave his delicacies,
\q
\v 7 for he is the kind of man who counts the price of the food.
\q "Eat and drink!" he says to you,
\q but his heart is not with you.
\q
\v 8 You will vomit up the little you have eaten
\q and you will have wasted your compliments.
\s5
\q
\v 9 Do not speak in the hearing of a fool,
\q for he will despise the wisdom of your words.
\q
\v 10 Do not move an ancient boundary stone
\q or encroach on the fields of orphans,
\q
\v 11 for their Redeemer is strong
\q and he will plead their case against you.
\s5
\q
\v 12 Apply your heart to instruction
\q and your ears to words of knowledge.
\s5
\q
\v 13 Do not withhold instruction from a child,
\q for if you discipline him, he will not die.
\q
\v 14 It is you who must beat him with the rod
\q and save his soul from Sheol.
\s5
\q
\v 15 My son, if your heart is wise,
\q then my heart also will be glad;
\q
\v 16 my inmost being will rejoice
\q when your lips speak what is right.
\s5
\q
\v 17 Do not let your heart envy sinners,

\q
\v 18 Surely there is a future

\s5
\q
\v 19 Hear—you!—my son, and be wise
\q and direct your heart in the way.
\q
\v 20 Do not associate with drunkards,

\v 21 for the drunkard and the glutton become poor

\s5
\q
\v 22 Listen to your father who begot you

\v 25 Let your father and your mother be glad

\q
\v 26 My son, give me your heart

\q
\v 27 For a prostitute is a deep pit,

\q
\v 29 Who has woe? Who has sorrow? Who has fights?

\s5
\q
\v 31 Do not look at the wine when it is red,

\q
\v 32 In the last it bites like a serpent
\q and it stings like an adder.
\q
\v 33 Your eyes will see strange things

\s5
\q
\v 34 You will be as one who sleeps on the high seas

\v 35 "They hit me," you will say, "but I was not hurt.

\s5
\c 24
\q
\v 1 Do not be envious of those who are evil,

\q
\v 7 Wisdom is too high for a fool;
\q in the gate he does not open his mouth.
\s5
\q
\v 8 There is one who plans to do evil—
\q people call him a master of schemes.
\q
\v 9 A foolish plan is sin

\s5
\q
\v 13 My son, eat honey because it is good,
\q because the drippings of the honeycomb are sweet to your taste.
\q
\v 14 Such is wisdom for your soul—

\s5
\q
\v 15 Do not lie in wait like the wicked person
\q who attacks the house of the righteous person.
\q Do not destroy his home!
\q
\v 16 For the righteous person falls down seven times and rises again,
\q but wicked people are brought down by calamity.
\s5
\q
\v 17 Do not celebrate when your enemy falls
\q and let not your heart be glad when he stumbles,

\v 18 or Yahweh will see and disapprove
\q and turn away his wrath from him.
\s5
\q
\v 19 Do not worry because of evildoers,

\v 20 for the evil person has no future

\s5
\q
\v 21 Fear Yahweh, and fear the king, my son;
\q do not associate with those who rebel against them,
\q
\v 22 for suddenly their disaster will come
\q and who knows the extent of the destruction that will come from both of them?
\s5
\p
\v 23 These also are sayings of the wise.
\q Partiality in judging a case at law is not good.
\s5
\q
\v 24 Whoever says to the wicked person, "You are a righteous person,"

\v 29 Do not say, "I will do to him what he has done to me;

\s5
\q
\v 30 I went by the field of a lazy man,

\q
\v 31 Thorns had grown up everywhere,
\q the ground was covered with nettles,
\q and its stone wall was broken down.
\s5
\q
\v 32 Then I saw and considered it;
\q I looked and received instruction.
\q
\v 33 A little sleep, a little slumber,
\q a little folding of the hands to rest—
\q
\v 34 and poverty comes marching upon you,
\q and your needs like an armed soldier.

\c 25
\p
\v 1 These are more proverbs of Solomon, copied by the men of Hezekiah, king of Judah.
\q
\v 2 It is the glory of God to conceal a matter,

\q
\v 3 Like the heavens are for height and the earth is for depth,
\q so the heart of kings is unsearchable.
\s5
\q
\v 4 Remove the dross from the silver
\q and a metal worker can use the silver in his craft.
\q
\v 5 Even so, remove wicked people from the presence of the king
\q and his throne will be established by doing what is right.
\s5
\q
\v 6 Do not honor yourself in the king's presence
\q and do not stand in the place designated for great people.
\s5
\q
\v 7 It is better for him to say to you, "Come up here,"
\q than for him to humiliate you before a nobleman.
\q What you have witnessed,
\q
\v 8 do not bring quickly to trial.
\q For what will you do in the end
\q when your neighbor puts you to shame?
\s5
\q
\v 9 Argue your case between you and your neighbor himself
\q and do not disclose another's secret,
\q
\v 10 or else the one who hears you will bring shame upon you
\q and an evil report about you that cannot be silenced.
\s5
\q
\v 11 Apples of gold in settings of silver
\q2 is a word spoken in the right situation.
\q
\v 12 A gold ring or jewelry made of fine gold
\q is a wise rebuke to a listening ear.
\s5
\q
\v 13 Like the cold of snow at harvest time
\q is a faithful messenger for those who sent him;

\s5
\q
\v 18 A man who bears false witness against his neighbor

\q

\s5
\q
\v 21 If your enemy is hungry, give him food to eat,
\q and if he is thirsty, give him water to drink,
\q
\v 22 for you will shovel coals of fire on his head

\s5
\q
\v 23 As surely as the north wind brings rain,

\v 13 The lazy person says, "There is a lion on the road!

\q
\v 15 The lazy person puts his hand into the dish

\q
\v 22 The words of a gossip are like delicious morsels;

\v 24 One who hates others disguises his feelings with his lips

\q and a maid when she takes the place of her mistress.
\s5
\q
\v 24 Four things on earth are small
\q and yet they are very wise:
\q
\v 25 the ants are creatures that are not strong,
\q but they prepare their food in the summer;
\q
\v 26 the rock badgers are not mighty creatures,
\q but they make their homes in the rocks.
\s5
\q
\v 27 Locusts have no king,
\q but all of them march in rank.
\q
\v 28 As for the lizard, you can hold it in your two hands,
\q yet they are found in kings' palaces.
\s5
\q
\v 29 There are three things that are stately in their stride
\q and four that are stately in how they walk:
\q
\v 30 a lion, strongest among wild animals—
\q it does not turn away from anything;
\q
\v 31 a strutting rooster; a goat;
\q and a king whose soldiers are beside him.
\s5
\q
\v 32 If you have been foolish, exalting yourself,
\q or if you have been devising evil—
\q put your hand over your mouth.
\q
\v 33 As churning milk makes butter
\q and as one's nose will produce blood if it is twisted,
\q so deeds done in anger produce conflict.
\s5
\c 31
\p
\v 1 The words of King Lemuel—an instruction his mother taught him.
\q
\v 2 What, my son? What is it, son of my womb?
\q What do you want, son of my vows?
\q
\v 3 Do not give your strength to women,
\q or your ways to those who destroy kings.
\s5
\q
\v 4 It is not for kings, Lemuel, it is not for kings to drink wine,
\q or for rulers to crave strong drink,
\q
\v 5 because when they drink they forget what has been decreed,
\q and pervert the rights of all the afflicted.
\s5
\q
\v 6 Give strong drink to a person who is perishing
\q and wine to those in bitter distress.
\q
\v 7 He will drink and he will forget his poverty
\q and he will not remember his trouble.
\s5
\q
\v 8 Speak for those who cannot speak,
\q for the causes of all who are perishing.
\q
\v 9 Speak out and judge by the measure of what is right
\q and plead the cause of poor and needy people.
\s5
\q
\v 10 Who can find a capable wife?
\q Her value is far more than jewels.
\q
\v 11 The heart of her husband trusts in her,
\q and he will never be poor.
\q
\v 12 She does good things for him and not evil
\q all the days of her life.
\s5
\q
\v 13 She selects wool and flax,
\q and works with the delight of her hands.
\q
\v 14 She is like the merchant ships;
\q she brings her food from far away.
\q
\v 15 She rises while it is night
\q and gives food to her household,
\q and she distributes the work for her female servants.
\s5
\q
\v 16 She considers a field and buys it,
\q with the fruit of her hands she plants a vineyard.
\q
\v 17 She dresses herself with strength
\q and makes her arms strong.
\s5
\q
\v 18 She perceives what will make a good profit for her;
\q all night long her lamp is not extinguished.
\q
\v 19 She puts her hands on the spindle,
\q and she holds the twisting thread.
\s5
\q
\v 20 She reaches out with her hand to poor people;
\q she reaches out with her hands to needy people.
\q
\v 21 She is not afraid of the snow for her household,
\q for all her household are clothed in scarlet.
\s5
\q
\v 22 She makes coverings for her bed,
\q and she wears clothes of fine purple linen.
\q
\v 23 Her husband is known at the gates,
\q when he sits with the elders of the land.
\s5
\q
\v 24 She makes linen garments and sells them,
\q and she supplies sashes to the merchants.
\q
\v 25 She is clothed with strength and honor,
\q and she laughs at the time to come.
\s5
\q
\v 26 She opens her mouth with wisdom
\q and the law of kindness is on her tongue.
\q
\v 27 She watches over the ways of her household
\q and does not eat the bread of idleness.
\s5
\q
\v 28 Her children rise up and call her blessed,
\q and her husband praises her, saying,
\q
\v 29 "Many women have done well,
\q but you surpassed them all."
\s5
\q
\v 30 Elegance is deceptive, beauty is vain,
\q but a woman who fears Yahweh, she will be praised.
\q
\v 31 Give her the fruit of her hands
\q and let her works praise her in the gates.
