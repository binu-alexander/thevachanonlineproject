\mt THE WISDOM OF JESUS THE SON OF SIRACH, 
\mt2 OR 
\mt ECCLESIASTICUS 
\is The Prologue of the Wisdom of Jesus the Son of Sirach. 
\ip WHEREAS many and great things have been delivered to us by the law and the prophets, and by the others that have followed
in their steps, for the which things we must give Israel the praise of instruction and wisdom; and since not only the readers
must needs become skillful themselves, but also they that love learning must be able to profit them which are without, both by
speaking and writing; my grandfather Jesus, having much given himself to the reading of the law, and the prophets, and the
other books of our fathers, and having gained great familiarity therein, was drawn on also himself to write somewhat pertaining
to instruction and wisdom; in order that those who love learning, and are addicted to these things, might make progress much
more by living according to the law. You⌃ are entreated therefore to read with favor and attention, and to pardon us, if in any
parts of what we have laboured to interpret, we may seem to fail in some of the phrases. For things originally spoken in Hebrew
have not the same force in them, when they are translated into another tongue: and not only these, but the law itself, and the
prophecies, and the rest of the books, have no small difference, when they are spoken in their original language. For having
come into Egypt in the eight and thirties year of Energetes the king, and having continued there some time, I found
\f +  \ft Or, \fqa a like work \ft The word is of very doubtful meaning.
\f* a copy affording no small instruction. I thought it therefore most necessary for me to apply some diligence and travail to
interpret this book; applying indeed much watchfulness and skill in that space of time to bring the book to an end, and set it
forth for them also, who in the land of their sojourning are desirous to learn, fashioning their manners beforehand, so as to
live according to the law.

\v 1 All wisdom \add comes \add* from the Lord, 
\q And is with him forever. 
\q
\v 2 The sand of the seas, and the drops of rain, 
\q And the days of eternity, who shall count? 
\q
\v 3 The height of the heaven, and the breadth of the earth, 
\q And the deep, and wisdom, who shall search \add them \add* out?
\q
\v 4 Wisdom has been created before all things, 
\q And the understanding of prudence from everlasting. 
\v 5  \f +  \ft Verses 5 and 7 are omitted by the best authorities
\f* 
\q
\v 6 To whom has the root of wisdom been revealed? 
\q And who has known her shrewd counsels? 
\v 7  \f +  \ft Verses 5 and 7 are omitted by the best authorities
\f* 
\q
\v 8 There is one wise, greatly to be feared, 
\q The Lord sitting upon his throne: 
\q
\v 9 He created her, 
\q And saw, and counted her, 
\q And poured her out upon all his works. 
\q
\v 10  \add She is \add* with all flesh according to his gift; 
\q And he gave her freely to them that love him. 
\q
\v 11 The fear of the Lord is glory, and exultation, 
\q And gladness, and a crown of rejoicing. 
\q
\v 12 The fear of the Lord shall delight the heart, 
\q And shall give gladness, and joy, and length of days. 
\q
\v 13 Whoso fears the Lord, it shall go well with him at the last,
\q And in the day of his death he shall be blessed. 
\q
\v 14 To fear the Lord is the beginning of wisdom; 
\q And it was created together with the faithful in the womb. 
\q
\v 15 With men she \f +  \ft Gr. \fqa nested. \f* laid an eternal foundation;
\q And with their seed shall she be had in trust. 
\q
\v 16 To fear the Lord is the fulness of wisdom; 
\q And she satiateth men with her fruits. 
\q
\v 17 She shall fill all her house with desirable things, 
\q And her garners with her produce. 
\q
\v 18 The fear of the Lord is the crown of wisdom, 
\q Making peace and \f +  \ft Gr. \fqa health of cure. \f* perfect health to flourish.
\f +  \ft The remainder of this verse is omitted by the best authorities.
\f* 
\q
\v 19 He both saw and counted her; 
\q He rained down skill and knowledge of understanding, 
\q And exalted the honor of them that hold her fast. 
\q
\v 20 To fear the Lord is the root of wisdom; 
\q And her branches are length of days. 
\v 21  \f +  \ft Verse 21 is omitted by the best authorities. \f*
\b
\q
\v 22 Unjust wrath can never be justified; 
\q For the sway of his wrath is his downfall. 
\q
\v 23 A man that is longsuffering will \f +  \ft Most authorities read
\fqa resist. \f* bear \f +  \ft Or, \fqa until \ft his \fqa season
\f* for a season, 
\q And afterward gladness shall spring up to him; 
\q
\v 24 He will hide his words \f +  \ft Or, \fqa until \ft his \fqa season
\f* for a season, 
\q And the lips of many shall tell forth his understanding. 
\q
\v 25 A parable of knowledge is in the treasures of wisdom; 
\q But godliness is an abomination to a sinner. 
\q
\v 26 If you desire wisdom, keep the commandments, 
\q And the Lord shall give her to you freely: 
\q
\v 27 For the fear of the Lord is wisdom and instruction; 
\q And \add in \add* faith and meekness is his good pleasure. 
\q
\v 28 Disobey not the fear of the Lord;\f +  \ft The remainder of this line is omitted by the best authorities.
\f* 
\q And come not to him with a double heart. 
\q
\v 29 Be not a hypocrite in the mouths of men; 
\q And take good heed to your lips. 
\q
\v 30 Exalt not yourself, lest you fall, 
\q And bring dishonor upon your soul; 
\q And \add so \add* the Lord shall reveal your secrets, 
\q And shall cast you down in the midst of the congregation; 
\q Because you came not to the fear of the Lord, 
\q And your heart was full of deceit. 
\b
\c 2  
\q
\v 1 My son, if you come to serve the Lord, 
\q Prepare your soul for temptation. 
\q
\v 2 Set your heart aright, and constantly endure, 
\q And make not haste in time of calamity. 
\q
\v 3 Cleave to him, and depart not, 
\q That you may be increased at your latter end. 
\q
\v 4 Accept whatever is brought upon you, 
\q And be longsuffering \f +  \ft Gr. \fqa in the changes of your humiliation.
\f* when you passest into humiliation. 
\q
\v 5 For gold is tried in the fire, 
\q And acceptable men in the furnace of humiliation. 
\q
\v 6 Put your trust in him, and he will help you: 
\q Order your ways aright, and set your hope on him. 
\b
\q
\v 7 You⌃ that fear the Lord, wait for his mercy; 
\q And turn not aside, lest you⌃ fall. 
\q
\v 8 You⌃ that fear the Lord, put your trust in him; 
\q And your reward shall not fail. 
\q
\v 9 You⌃ that fear the Lord, hope for good things, 
\q And for eternal gladness and mercy. 
\q
\v 10 Look at the generations of old, and see: 
\q Who did ever put his trust in the Lord, and was ashamed? 
\q Or who did abide in his fear, and was forsaken? 
\q Or who did call upon him, and he despised him? 
\q
\v 11 For the Lord is full of compassion and mercy; 
\q And he forgives sins, and saves in time of affliction. 
\b
\q
\v 12 Woe to fearful hearts, and to faint hands, 
\q And to the sinner that goes two ways! 
\q
\v 13 Woe to the faint heart! for it believes not; 
\q Therefore shall it not be defended. 
\q
\v 14 Woe to you that have lost your patience! 
\q And what will you⌃ do when the Lord shall visit you? 
\q
\v 15 They that fear the Lord will not disobey his words; 
\q And they that love him will keep his ways. 
\q
\v 16 They that fear the Lord will seek his good pleasure; 
\q And they that love him shall be filled with the law. 
\q
\v 17 They that fear the Lord will prepare their hearts, 
\q And will humble their souls in his sight, 
\q
\v 18  \add saying, \add* 
\q We will fall into the hands of the Lord, 
\q And not into the hands of men: 
\q For as his majesty is, 
\q So also is his mercy. 
\b
\c 3  
\q
\v 1 Hear me your father, O my children, 
\q And do thereafter, that you⌃ may be saved. 
\q
\v 2 For the Lord has given the father glory as touching the children,
\q And has confirmed the judgement of the mother as touching the sons.
\q
\v 3 He that honors his father shall make atonement for sins: 
\q
\v 4 And he that gives glory to his mother is as one that lays up treasure.
\q
\v 5 Whoso honors his father shall have joy of his children; 
\q And in the day of his prayer he shall be heard. 
\q
\v 6 He that gives glory to his father shall have length of days;
\q And he that hearkens to the Lord shall bring rest to his mother,
\q
\v 7  \f +  \ft The preceding words of this verse are omitted by the best authorities.
\f* And will do service under his parents, as to masters. 
\q
\v 8 In deed and word honor your father, 
\q That a blessing may come upon you from him. 
\q
\v 9 For the blessing of the father establishes the houses of children;
\q But the curse of the mother roots out the foundations. 
\b
\q
\v 10 Glorify not yourself in the dishonor of your father; 
\q For your father’s dishonor is no glory to you. 
\q
\v 11 For the glory of a man is from the honor of his father; 
\q And a mother in dishonor is a reproach to her children. 
\q
\v 12 My son, help your father in his old age; 
\q And grieve him not as long as he lives. 
\q
\v 13 And if he fails in understanding, have patience with him; 
\q And dishonor him not \add while you are \add* in your full strength.
\q
\v 14 For the relieving of your father shall not be forgotten: 
\q And instead of sins it shall be added to build you up. 
\q
\v 15 In the day of your affliction it shall remember you; 
\q As fair weather upon ice, 
\q So shall your sins also melt away. 
\q
\v 16 He that forsakes his father is as a blasphemer; 
\q And he that provoketh his mother is cursed of the Lord. 
\b
\q
\v 17 My son, go on with your business in meekness; 
\q So shall you be beloved of an acceptable man. 
\q
\v 18 The greater you are, humble yourself the more, 
\q And you shall find favor before the Lord. 
\v 19  \f +  \ft Verse 19 is omitted by the best authorities.\f*
\q
\v 20 For great is the potency of the Lord, 
\q And he is glorified of them that are lowly. 
\q
\v 21 Seek not things that are too hard for you, 
\q And search not out things that are above your strength. 
\q
\v 22 The things that have been commanded you, think thereupon; 
\q For you have no need of the things that are secret. 
\q
\v 23 Be not over busy in your superfluous works: 
\q For more things are showed to you than men can understand. 
\q
\v 24 For the conceit of many has led them astray; 
\q And evil surmising has caused their judgement to slip. 
\v 25  \f +  \ft Most authorities omit verse 25, and transpose the lines in verse 26.
\f* 
\b
\q
\v 26 A stubborn heart shall fare ill at the last; 
\q And he that loves danger shall perish therein. 
\q
\v 27 A stubborn heart shall be laden with troubles; 
\q And the sinner shall heap sin upon \f +  \ft Gr. \fqa sins. \f* sin.
\q
\v 28 The calamity of the proud is no healing; 
\q For a plant of wickedness has taken root in him. 
\q
\v 29 The heart of the prudent will understand a parable; 
\q And the ear of a listener is the desire of a wise man. 
\q
\v 30 Water will quench a flaming fire; 
\q And almsgiving will make atonement for sins. 
\q
\v 31 He that requites good turns is mindful of that which comes afterward;
\q And in the time of his falling he shall find a support. 
\b
\c 4  
\q
\v 1 My son, deprive not the poor of his living, 
\q And make not the needy eyes to wait long. 
\q
\v 2 Make not a hungry soul sorrowful; 
\q Neither provoke a man in his distress. 
\q
\v 3 To a heart that is provoked add not more trouble; 
\q And defer not to give to him that is in need. 
\q
\v 4 Reject not a suppliant in his affliction; 
\q And turn not away your face from a poor man. 
\q
\v 5 Turn not away your eye from one that asks \add of you, \add*
\q And give none occasion to a man to curse you: 
\q
\v 6 For if he curse you in the bitterness of his soul, 
\q He that made him will hear his supplication. 
\b
\q
\v 7 Get yourself the love of the congregation; 
\q And to a great man bow your head. 
\q
\v 8 Incline your ear to a poor man, 
\q And answer him with peaceful words in meekness. 
\q
\v 9 Deliver him that is wronged from the hand of him that wrongeth him;
\q And be not faint-hearted in giving judgement. 
\q
\v 10 Be as a father to the fatherless, 
\q And instead of a husband to their mother: 
\q So shall you be as a son of the Most High, 
\q And he shall love you more than your mother does. 
\b
\q
\v 11 Wisdom exalts her sons, 
\q And takes hold of them that seek her. 
\q
\v 12 He that loves her loves life; 
\q And they that seek to her early shall be filled with gladness.
\q
\v 13 He that holds her fast shall inherit glory; 
\q And where \f +  \ft Or, \fqa she \f* he enters, the Lord will bless.
\q
\v 14 They that do her service shall minister to the Holy One; 
\q And them that love her the Lord does love. 
\q
\v 15 He that gives ear to her shall judge the nations; 
\q And he that gives heed to her shall dwell securely. 
\q
\v 16 If he trust her, he shall inherit her; 
\q And his generations shall have her in possession. 
\q
\v 17 For at the first she will walk with him in crooked ways, 
\q And will bring fear and dread upon him, 
\q And torment him with her discipline, 
\q Until she may trust his soul, and try him by her judgements: 
\q
\v 18 Then will she return again the straight way to him, 
\q And will gladden him, and reveal to him her secrets. 
\q
\v 19 If he go astray, she will forsake him, 
\q And give him over \f +  \ft Gr. \fqa to the hands of his fall.
\f* to his fall. 
\b
\q
\v 20 Observe the opportunity, and beware of \f +  \ft Or, \fqa an evil man
\f* evil; 
\q And be not ashamed concerning your soul. 
\q
\v 21 For there is a shame that brings sin; 
\q And there is a shame \add that is \add* glory and grace. 
\q
\v 22 Accept not the person \add of any \add* against your soul;
\q And \f +  \ft Or, \fqa be not abashed \f* reverence no man to your falling.
\q
\v 23 Refrain not speech, \f +  \ft Gr. \fqa in an occasion of safety.
\f* when it tendeth to safety; 
\q \f +  \ft Most authorities omit this line. \f* And hide not your wisdom for the sake of fair-seeming.
\q
\v 24 For by speech wisdom shall be known; 
\q And instruction by the word of the tongue. 
\q
\v 25 Speak not against the truth; 
\q And be abashed for your ignorance. 
\q
\v 26 Be not ashamed to make confession of your sins; 
\q And force not the current of the river. 
\q
\v 27 Lay not yourself down for a fool to tread upon; 
\q And accept not the person of one that is mighty. 
\q
\v 28 Strive for the truth to death, and the Lord God shall fight for you.
\b
\q
\v 29 Be not \f +  \ft Some authorities read \fqa rough. \f* hasty in your tongue,
\q And in your deeds slack and remiss. 
\q
\v 30 Be not as a lion in your house, 
\q Nor fanciful among your servants. 
\q
\v 31 Let not your hand be stretched out to receive, and \f +  \ft Or,
\fqa drawn back \f* closed when you should repay. 
\c 5  
\q
\v 1 Set not your heart upon your goods; 
\q And say not, They are sufficient for me. 
\q
\v 2 Follow not your own mind and your strength, 
\q To walk in the desires of your heart; 
\q
\v 3 And say not, Who shall have dominion over me? 
\q For the Lord will surely take vengeance on you. 
\b
\q
\v 4 Say not, I sinned, and what happened to me? 
\q For the Lord is longsuffering. \f +  \ft The remainder of this verse is omitted by the best authorities.
\f* 
\q
\v 5 Concerning atonement, be not without fear, 
\q To add sin upon sins: 
\q
\v 6 And say not, His compassion is great; 
\q He will be pacified for the multitude of my sins: 
\q For mercy and wrath are with him, 
\q And his indignation will rest upon sinners. 
\q
\v 7 Make no tarrying to turn to the Lord; 
\q And put not off from day to day: 
\q For suddenly shall the wrath of the Lord come forth; \f +  \ft A line of this verse is here omitted by the best authorities.
\f* 
\q And you shall perish in the time of vengeance. 
\b
\q
\v 8 Set not your heart upon unrighteous gains: 
\q For you shall profit nothing in the day of calamity. 
\q
\v 9 Winnow not with every wind, 
\q And walk not in every path: 
\q Thus does the sinner that has a double tongue. 
\q
\v 10 Be stedfast in your understanding; 
\q And let your word be one. 
\b
\q
\v 11 Be swift to hear; \f +  \ft The remainder of this line is omitted by the best authorities.
\f* 
\q And with patience make your answer. 
\q
\v 12 If you have understanding, answer your neighbor; 
\q And if not, let your hand be upon your mouth. 
\q
\v 13 Glory and dishonor is in talk: 
\q And the tongue of a man is his fall. 
\q
\v 14 Be not called a whisperer; 
\q And lie not in wait with your tongue: 
\q For upon the thief there is shame, 
\q And an evil condemnation upon him that has a double tongue. 
\q
\v 15 In a great matter and in a small, be not ignorant; 
\c 6  
\q
\v 1 And instead of a friend become not an enemy; 
\q For an evil name shall inherit shame and reproach: 
\q Even so shall the sinner that has a double tongue. 
\b
\q
\v 2 Exalt not yourself in the counsel of your soul; 
\q That your soul be not torn in pieces as a bull: 
\q
\v 3 You shall eat up your leaves, and destroy your fruits, 
\q And leave yourself as a dry tree. 
\q
\v 4 A wicked soul shall destroy him that has gotten it, 
\q And shall make him \f +  \ft Or, \fqa a rejoicing \f* a laughing stock to his enemies.
\b
\q
\v 5  \f +  \ft Gr. \fqa A sweet throat. \f* Sweet words will multiply
\f +  \ft Gr. \fqa his. \f* a man’s friends; 
\q And a fair-speaking tongue will multiply courtesies. 
\q
\v 6 Let those that are at peace with you be many; 
\q But your counselors one of a thousand. 
\q
\v 7 If you would get you a friend, get him \f +  \ft Or, \fqa in the time of trial
\f* by proving, 
\q And be not in haste to trust him. 
\q
\v 8 For there is a friend \add that is so \add* for his own occasion;
\q And he will not continue in the day of your affliction. 
\q
\v 9 And there is a friend that turns to enmity; 
\q And he will discover strife to your reproach. 
\q
\v 10 And there is a friend that is a companion at the table; 
\q And he will not continue in the day of your affliction. 
\q
\v 11 And in your prosperity he will be as yourself, 
\q And will be bold over your servants: 
\q
\v 12 If you shall be brought low, he will be against you, 
\q And will hide himself from your face. 
\q
\v 13 Separate yourself from your enemies; 
\q And beware of your friends. 
\b
\q
\v 14 A faithful friend is a strong \f +  \ft Or, \fqa covert \f* defence;
\q And he that has found him has found a treasure. 
\q
\v 15 There is nothing that can be taken in exchange for a faithful friend;
\q And his excellency is beyond \f +  \ft Gr. \fqa weight. \f* price.
\q
\v 16 A faithful friend is a medicine of life; 
\q And they that fear the Lord shall find him. 
\q
\v 17 He that fears the Lord directs his friendship aright; 
\q For as he is, so is his neighbor also. 
\b
\q
\v 18 My son, gather instruction from your youth up: 
\q And even to hoar hairs you shall find wisdom. 
\q
\v 19 Come to her as one that plows and sows, 
\q And wait for her good fruits; 
\q For your toil shall be little in the tillage of her, 
\q And you shall eat of her fruits right soon. 
\q
\v 20 How exceeding harsh is she to the unlearned! 
\q And he that is without understanding will not abide in her. 
\q
\v 21 As a mighty stone of trial shall she rest upon him; 
\q And he will not delay to cast her from him. 
\q
\v 22 For wisdom is according to her name; and she is not manifest to many.
\b
\q
\v 23 Give ear, my son, and accept my judgement, 
\q And refuse not my counsel, 
\q
\v 24 And bring your feet into her fetters, 
\q And your neck into her chain. 
\q
\v 25 Put your shoulder under her, and bear her, 
\q And be not grieved with her bonds. 
\q
\v 26 Come to her with all your soul, 
\q And keep her ways with your whole power. 
\q
\v 27 Search, and seek, and she shall be made known to you; 
\q And when you have got hold of her, let her not go. 
\q
\v 28 For at the last you shall find her rest; 
\q And \f +  \ft Or, \fqa it \f* she shall be turned for you into gladness.
\q
\v 29 And her fetters shall be to you for a covering of strength,
\q And her chains for a robe of glory. 
\q
\v 30 For there is a golden ornament upon her, 
\q And her bands are \f +  \ft Numbers 15:38. \f* a riband of blue.
\q
\v 31 You shall put her on \add as \add* a robe of glory, 
\q And shall array you with her \add as \add* a crown of rejoicing.
\b
\q
\v 32 My son, if you will, you shall be instructed; 
\q And if you will yield your soul, you shall be \f +  \ft Or, \fqa shrewd
\f* prudent. 
\q
\v 33 If you love to hear, you shall receive; 
\q And if you incline your ear, you shall be wise. 
\q
\v 34 Stand you in the multitude of the elders; 
\q And whoso is wise, cleave you to him. 
\q
\v 35 Be willing to listen to every godly discourse; 
\q And let not the proverbs of understanding escape you. 
\q
\v 36 If you see a man of understanding, get you betimes to him,
\q And let your foot wear out the steps of his doors. 
\q
\v 37 Let your mind dwell upon the ordinances of the Lord, 
\q And meditate continually in his commandments: 
\q He shall establish your heart, 
\q And your desire of wisdom shall be given to you. 
\b
\c 7  
\q
\v 1 Do no evil, so shall no evil overtake you. 
\q
\v 2 Depart from wrong, and it shall turn aside from you. 
\q
\v 3 My son, sow not upon the furrows of unrighteousness, 
\q And you shall not reap them sevenfold. 
\b
\q
\v 4 Seek not of the Lord preeminence, 
\q Neither of the king the seat of honor. 
\q
\v 5 Justify not yourself in the presence of the Lord; 
\q And display not your wisdom before the king. 
\q
\v 6 Seek not to be a judge, 
\q Lest you be not able to take away iniquities; 
\q Lest haply you fear the person of a mighty man, 
\q And lay a stumbling block in the way of your uprightness. 
\b
\q
\v 7 Sin not against the multitude of the city, 
\q And cast not yourself down in the crowd. 
\q
\v 8 Bind not up sin twice; 
\q For in one \add sin \add* you shall not be unpunished. 
\q
\v 9 Say not, He will look upon the multitude of my gifts, 
\q And when I offer to the Most High God, he will accept \f +  \ft Or,
\fqa them \f* it. 
\q
\v 10 Be not faint-hearted in your prayer; 
\q And neglect not to give alms. 
\b
\q
\v 11 Laugh not a man to scorn when he is in the bitterness of his soul;
\q For there is one who humbles and exalts. 
\q
\v 12  \f +  \ft Gr. \fqa Plow not. \f* Devise not a lie against your brother;
\q Neither do the like to a friend. 
\q
\v 13 Love not to make any manner of lie; 
\q For the custom thereof is not for good. 
\q
\v 14 Prate not in the multitude of elders; 
\q And repeat not your words in your prayer. 
\b
\q
\v 15 Hate not laborious work; 
\q Neither husbandry, which the Most High has \f +  \ft Gr. \fqa created.

\v 3 The vision of dreams is \add as \add* this thing against that,

\v 4 Of an unclean thing what shall be cleansed? 
\q And of that which is false what shall be true? 
\q
\v 5 Divinations, and soothsayings, and dreams, are vain: 
\q And the heart fancies, as a woman’s in travail. 
\q
\v 6 If they be not sent from the Most High in \add your \add* visitation,
\q Give not your heart to them. 
\v 7 For dreams have led many astray:

\v 8 Without lying shall the law be accomplished;

\q
\v 9 A well-instructed man knows many things;

\v 10 He that has no experience knows few things:

\q
\v 11 In my wandering I have seen many things;

\q
\v 12 Ofttimes was I in danger even to death;

\v 13 The spirit of those that fear the Lord shall live;

\v 14 Whoso fears the Lord shall not be afraid, and shall not play the coward;

\q
\v 15 Blessed is the soul of him that fears the Lord: 
\q To whom does he give heed? and who is his stay? 
\q
\v 16 The eyes of the Lord are upon them that love him, 
\q A mighty protection and strong stay, 
\q A cover from the hot blast, and a cover from the noonday, 
\q A guard from stumbling, and a succour from falling.

\v 17 He raises up the soul, and enlighteneth the eyes: 
\q He gives healing, life, and blessing. 
\b
\q
\v 18 He that sacrifices of a thing wrongfully gotten, his offering is made in mockery;
\q And the mockeries of wicked men are not well-pleasing.

\v 19 The Most High has no pleasure in the offerings of the ungodly;
\q Neither is he pacified for sins by the multitude of sacrifices.
\q
\v 20  \add As \add* one that kills the son before his father’s eyes

\v 21 The bread of the needy is the life of the poor:

\v 25 He that washes himself after \add touching \add* a dead body, and touches it again,
\q What profit has he in his washing? 
\q
\v 26 Even so a man fasting for his sins,

\q
\v 1 He that keeps the law multiplies offerings; 
\q He that takes heed to the commandments sacrifices a peace offering.
\q
\v 2 He that requites a good turn offers fine flour; 
\q And he that gives alms sacrifices a thank offering. 
\q
\v 3 To depart from wickedness is a thing pleasing to the Lord; 
\q And to depart from unrighteousness is a propitiation. 
\q
\v 4 See that you appear not in the presence of the Lord empty.

\v 5 For all these things \add are to be done \add* because of the commandment.

\v 6 The offering of the righteous makes the altar fat;

\q
\v 7 The sacrifice of a righteous man is acceptable;

\v 8 Glorify the Lord with a good eye,

\v 11 For the Lord recompenses, 
\q And he will recompense you sevenfold. 
\b
\q
\v 12 Think not to corrupt with gifts; for he will not receive them:
\q And set not your mind on an unrighteous sacrifice; 
\q For the Lord is judge, 
\q And with him is no respect of persons. 
\q
\v 13 He will not accept any person against a poor man; 
\q And he will listen to the prayer of him that is wronged. 
\q
\v 14 He will in no wise despise the supplication of the fatherless;

\v 16 He that serves \add God \add* according to his good pleasure shall be accepted,
\q And his supplication shall reach to the clouds. 
\q
\v 17 The prayer of the humble pierces the clouds; 
\q And till it come near, he will not be comforted; 
\q And he will not depart, till the Most High shall visit; 
\q And he shall judge \f +  \ft Some ancient authorities read \fqa for the righteous.

\q
\v 18 And the Lord will not be slack, neither will he be longsuffering toward them,

\v 17 Make bitter weeping, and make passionate wailing,

\v 5  \add There is \add* wrath, and jealousy, and trouble, and disquiet,

\v 6 A little or nothing is his resting,

\q He is troubled in the vision of his heart,

\q
\v 9 Death, and bloodshed, and strife, and sword,

\v 25 Gold and silver will make the foot stand sure;

\v 29 A man that looks to the table of another,

\q
\v 2 O death, acceptable is your sentence to a man that is needy, and that fails in strength,

\q
\v 3 Fear not the sentence of death;

\v 5 The children of sinners are abominable children,

\v 7 Children will complain of an ungodly father,

\v 16 Wherefore show reverence to my word:

\v 9 A daughter is a secret cause of wakefulness to a father;

\q
\v 11 Keep a strict watch over a headstrong daughter,

\q
\v 12 Look not upon every body in regard of beauty,

\v 13 For from garments comes a moth,

\q
\v 15 I will make mention now of the works of the Lord,

\q
\v 16 The sun that gives light looks upon all things; 
\q And the work of the Lord is full of his glory. 
\q
\v 17 The Lord has not given power to the saints to declare all his marvelous works;
\q Which the Almighty Lord firmly settled, 
\q That whatever is might be established in his glory. 
\q
\v 18 He searcheth out the deep, and the heart, 
\q And he has understanding of their cunning devices:

\v 19 Declaring the things that are past, and the things that shall be,

\q
\v 20 No thought escapes him; 
\q There is not a word hid from him. 
\q
\v 21 The mighty works of his wisdom he has ordered, 
\q Who is from everlasting to everlasting: 
\q Nothing has been added to them, nor diminished from them;

\q
\v 22 How desirable are all his works! 
\q One may behold \add this \add* even to a spark. 
\q
\v 23 All these things live and remain for ever in all manner of uses,
\q And they are all obedient. 
\q
\v 24 All things are double one against another: 
\q And he has made nothing imperfect. 
\q
\v 25 One thing establishes the good things of another: 
\q And who shall be filled with beholding his glory?

\q
\v 1 The pride of the height is the firmament \f +  \ft Gr. \fqa of clearness.
\f* in its clearness, 
\q The appearance of heaven, in the spectacle of its glory. 
\q
\v 2 The sun when he appears, bringing tidings as he goes forth,
\q Is a marvelous instrument, the work of the Most High: 
\q
\v 3 At his noon he dries up the country, 
\q And who shall stand against his burning heat? 
\q
\v 4 A man blowing a furnace is in works of heat, 
\q \add But \add* the sun three times more, burning up the mountains:
\q Breathing out fiery vapours, 
\q And sending forth bright beams, he dims the eyes. 
\q
\v 5 Great is the Lord that made him; 
\q And at his word he hastens his course. 
\b
\q
\v 6 The moon also is in all things for her season,

\q
\v 7 From the moon is the sign of the feast day; 
\q A light that waneth when she is come to the full. 
\q
\v 8 The month is called after her name, 
\q Increasing wonderfully in her changing; 
\q An instrument of the hosts on high, 
\q Shining forth in the firmament of heaven; 
\q
\v 9 The beauty of heaven, the glory of the stars, 
\q An ornament giving light in the highest places of the Lord. 
\q
\v 10 At the word of the Holy One they will stand in \f +  \ft Gr.

\v 13 By his commandment he makes the snow to fall apace, 
\q And sends swiftly the lightnings of his judgement. 
\q
\v 14 By reason thereof the treasure-houses are opened; 
\q And clouds fly forth as fowls. 
\q
\v 15 By his mighty power he makes strong the clouds, 
\q And the hailstones are broken small: 
\q
\v 16 And at his appearing the mountains will be shaken, 
\q And at his will the south wind will blow. 
\q
\v 17 The voice of his thunder makes the earth to travail; 
\q So does the northern storm and the whirlwind: 
\q As birds flying down he sprinkleth the snow; 
\q And as the lighting of the locust is the falling down thereof:
\q
\v 18 The eye will marvel at the beauty of its whiteness, 
\q And the heart will be astonished at the raining of it. 
\q
\v 19 The hoar frost also he pours on the earth as salt; 
\q And when it is congealed, it is \add as \add* points of thorns.
\b
\q
\v 20 The cold north wind shall blow, 
\q And the ice shall be congealed on the water: 
\q It shall lodge upon every gathering together of water, 
\q And the water shall put on as it were a breastplate. 
\q
\v 21 It shall devour the mountains, and burn up the wilderness,
\q And consume the green herb as fire. 
\q
\v 22 A mist coming speedily is the healing of all things; 
\q A dew coming after heat shall bring cheerfulness. 
\q
\v 23 By his counsel he has stilled the deep, 
\q And \f +  \ft The most ancient authorities read \fqa Jesus planted it.

\v 24 They that sail on the sea tell of the danger thereof;

\v 28 How shall we have strength to glorify him?

\v 29 The Lord is terrible and exceeding great;

\q And did not one day become as two? 
\q
\v 5 He called upon the Most High \add and \add* Mighty One, 
\q When his foes pressed him round about; 
\q And the great Lord heard him. 
\q
\v 6 With hailstones of mighty power 
\q He caused war to break violently upon the nation, 
\q And \f +  \ft See Joshua 10:11 \f* in the going down he destroyed them that resisted;
\q That the nations might know his \f +  \ft Gr. \fqa panoply. \f* armor,
\q How that he fought in the sight of the Lord; 
\q For he followed after the Mighty One. 
\q
\v 7 Also in the time of Moses he did a work of mercy, 
\q He and Caleb the son of Jephunneh, 
\q In that they withstood the adversary, 
\q Hindered the people from sin, 
\q And stilled the murmuring of wickedness. 
\q
\v 8 And of six hundred thousand people on foot, they two alone were preserved
\q To bring them into the heritage, 
\q Even into a land flowing with milk and honey. 
\q
\v 9 Also the Lord gave strength to Caleb, 
\q And it remained with him to his old age; 
\q So that he entered upon the height of the land, 
\q And his seed obtained it for a heritage: 
\q
\v 10 That all the children of Israel might see 
\q That it is good to walk after the Lord. 
\b
\q
\v 11 Also the judges, every one by his name, 
\q All whose hearts went not a whoring, 
\q And who turned not away from the Lord, 
\q May their memorial be blessed. 
\q
\v 12 May their bones flourish again out of their place, 
\q And may the name of them that have been honored be renewed upon their children.

\q
\v 13 Samuel, the prophet of the Lord, beloved of his Lord, 
\q Established a kingdom, and anointed princes over his people. 
\q
\v 14 By the law of the Lord he judged the congregation, 
\q And the Lord visited Jacob. 
\q
\v 15 By his faithfulness he was proved to be a prophet, 
\q And by his words he was known to be faithful in vision. 
\q
\v 16 Also when his enemies pressed him round about 
\q He called upon the Lord, the Mighty One, 
\q With the offering of the sucking lamb. 
\q
\v 17 And the Lord thundered from heaven, 
\q And with a mighty sound made his voice to be heard. 
\q
\v 18 And he utterly destroyed the rulers of the Tyrians, 
\q And all the princes of the Philistines. 
\q
\v 19 Also before the time of his \f +  \ft Gr. \fqa age-long sleep.
\f* long sleep 
\q He made protestations in the sight of the lord and \add his \add* anointed,
\q I have not taken any man’s goods, so much as a shoe: 
\q And no man did accuse him. 
\q
\v 20 And after he fell asleep he prophesied, 
\q And showed the king his end, 
\q And lifted up his voice from the earth in prophecy, 
\q To blot out the wickedness of the people. 
\b
\c 47  
\q
\v 1 And after him rose up Nathan 
\q To prophesy in the days of David. 
\q
\v 2 As is the fat when it is separated from the peace offering,
\q So was David \add separated \add* from the children of Israel.
\q
\v 3 He played with lions as with kids, 
\q And with bears as with lambs of the flock. 
\q
\v 4 In his youth did he not kill a giant, 
\q And take away reproach from the people, 
\q When he lifted up his hand with a sling stone, 
\q And beat down the boasting of Goliath? 
\q
\v 5 For he called upon the Most High Lord; 
\q And he gave him strength in his right hand, 
\q To kill a man mighty in war, 
\q To exalt the horn of his people. 
\q
\v 6 So they glorified him for \add his \add* ten thousands, 
\q And praised him for the blessings of the Lord, 
\q In that there was given him a diadem of glory. 
\q
\v 7 For he destroyed the enemies on every side, 
\q And brought to nothing the Philistines his adversaries, 
\q Brake their horn in pieces to this day. 
\q
\v 8 In every work of his he gave thanks to the Holy One Most High with words of glory;
\q With his whole heart he sang praise, 
\q And loved him that made him. 
\q
\v 9 Also he set singers before the altar, 
\q And to make sweet melody by their music. \f +  \ft The remainder of this verse is omitted by the best authorities.
\f* 
\q
\v 10 He gave comeliness to the feasts, 
\q And set in order the seasons to perfection, 
\q While they praised his holy name, 
\q And the sanctuary sounded from early morning. 
\q
\v 11 The Lord took away his sins, 
\q And exalted his horn for ever; 
\q And gave him a covenant of kings, 
\q And a throne of glory in Israel. 
\q
\v 12 After him rose up a son, a man of understanding; 
\q And for his sake he lived at large. 
\q
\v 13 Solomon reigned in days of peace; 
\q And to him God gave rest round about, 
\q That he might set up a house for his name, 
\q And prepare a sanctuary for ever. 
\q
\v 14 How wise was you made in your youth, 
\q And filled as a river with understanding! 
\q
\v 15 Your soul covered the earth, 
\q And you filled it with \f +  \ft Gr. \fqa parables of riddles.
\f* dark parables. 
\q
\v 16 Your name reached to the aisles afar off; 
\q And for your peace you were beloved. 
\q
\v 17 For your songs and proverbs and parables, 
\q And for your interpretations, the countries marveled at you. 
\q
\v 18 By the name of the Lord God, 
\q Which is called the God of Israel, 
\q You did gather gold as tin, 
\q And did multiply silver as lead. 
\q
\v 19 You did bow your loins to women, 
\q And in your body you were brought into subjection. 
\q
\v 20 You did blemish your honor, 
\q And profane your seed, 
\q To bring wrath upon your children; 
\q And I was grieved for your folly: 
\q
\v 21 So that the sovereignty was divided, 
\q And out of Ephraim ruled a disobedient kingdom. 
\q
\v 22 But the Lord will never forsake his mercy; 
\q And he will not destroy any of his works, 
\q Nor blot out the posterity of his elect; 
\q And the seed of him that loved him he will not take away; 
\q And he gave a remnant to Jacob, 
\q And to David a root out of him. 
\b
\q
\v 23 And \add so \add* rested Solomon with his fathers; 
\q And of his seed he left behind him Rehoboam, 
\q \add Even \add* the foolishness of the people, and one that lacked understanding,
\q Who made the people to revolt by his counsel. 
\q Also Jeroboam the son of Nebat, 
\q Who made Israel to sin, 
\q And gave to Ephraim a way of sin. 
\q
\v 24 And their sins were multiplied exceedingly, 
\q To remove them from their land. 
\q
\v 25 For they sought out all manner of wickedness, 
\q Till vengeance should come upon them. 
\b
\c 48  
\q
\v 1 Also there arose Elijah the prophet as fire, 
\q And his word burned like a torch: 
\q
\v 2 Who brought a famine upon them, 
\q And by his zeal made them few in number. 
\q
\v 3 By the word of the Lord he shut up the heaven: 
\q Thrice did he thus bring down fire. 
\q
\v 4 How was you glorified, O Elijah, in your wondrous deeds! 
\q And who shall glory like to you? 
\q
\v 5 Who did raise up a dead man from death, 
\q And from \f +  \ft Gr. \fqa Hades. \f* the place of the dead, by the word of the Most High:
\q
\v 6 Who brought down kings to destruction, 
\q And honorable men from their bed: 
\q
\v 7 Who heard rebuke in Sinai, 
\q And judgements of vengeance in Horeb: 
\q
\v 8 Who anointed kings for retribution, 
\q And prophets to succeed after him: 
\q
\v 9 Who was taken up in a tempest of fire, 
\q In a chariot of fiery horses: 
\q
\v 10 Who was recorded for reproofs in their seasons, 
\q To pacify anger, before it brake forth into wrath; 
\q To turn the heart of the father to the son, 
\q And to restore the tribes of Jacob. 
\q
\v 11 Blessed are they that saw you, 
\q And they that have been beautified with love; 
\q For we also shall surely live. 
\b
\q
\v 12 Elijah \add it was, \add* who was wrapped in a tempest: 
\q And Elisha was filled with his spirit; 
\q And in \add all \add* his days he was not moved by \add the fear of
\add* any ruler, 
\q And no one brought him into subjection. 
\q
\v 13  \f +  \ft Or, \fqa No man’s word overcame him \f* Nothing was too high for him;
\q And when he was laid on sleep his body prophesied. 
\q
\v 14 As in his life he did wonders, 
\q So in death were his works marvelous. 
\q
\v 15 For all this the people repented not, 
\q And they departed not from their sins, 
\q Till they were carried away as a spoil from their land, 
\q And were scattered through all the earth; 
\q And the people was left very few in number, 
\q And a ruler \add was left \add* in the house of David. 
\q
\v 16 Some of them did that which was pleasing \add to God, \add*
\q And some multiplied sins. 
\b
\q
\v 17 Hezekiah fortified his city, 
\q And brought in \f +  \ft Some ancient authorities, apparently by a confusion, read
\fqa Gog. \f* water into the midst of them: 
\q He digged the sheer rock with iron, 
\q And builded up wells for waters. 
\q
\v 18 In his days Sennacherib came up, 
\q And sent Rabshakeh, and departed; 
\q And he lifted up his hand against Sion, 
\q And boasted great things in his arrogancy. 
\q
\v 19 Then were their hearts and their hands shaken, 
\q And they were in pain, as women in travail; 
\q
\v 20 And they called upon the Lord which is merciful, 
\q Spreading forth their hands to him: 
\q And the Holy One heard them speedily out of Heaven, 
\q And delivered them by the hand of Isaiah. 
\q
\v 21 He struck the camp of the Assyrians, 
\q And his angel utterly destroyed them. 
\q
\v 22 For Hezekiah did that which was pleasing to the Lord, 
\q And was strong in the ways of David his father, 
\q Which Isaiah the prophet commanded, 
\q Who was great and faithful in his vision. 
\q
\v 23 In his days the sun went backward; 
\q And he added life to the king. 
\q
\v 24 He saw by an excellent spirit what should come to pass at the last;
\q And he comforted them that mourned in Sion. 
\q
\v 25 He showed the things that should be to the end of time, 
\q And the hidden things or ever they came.

\q
\v 1 The memorial of Josiah is like the composition of incense 
\q Prepared by the work of the apothecary: 
\q It shall be sweet as honey in every mouth, 
\q And as music at a banquet of wine. 
\q
\v 2 He behaved himself uprightly in the conversion of the people,
\q And took away the abominations of iniquity. 
\q
\v 3 He set his heart right toward the Lord; 
\q In the days of wicked men he made godliness to prevail. 
\b
\q
\v 4 Except David and Hezekiah and Josiah, 
\q All committed trespass: 
\q For they forsook the law of the Most High; 
\q The kings of Judah failed. 
\q
\v 5 For they gave their \f +  \ft Gr. \fqa horn. \f* power to others,
\q And their glory to a strange nation. 
\q
\v 6 They set on fire the chosen city of the sanctuary, 
\q And made her streets desolate, \add as it was written \add* by the hand of Jeremiah.
\q
\v 7 For they entreated him evil; 
\q And yet he was sanctified in the womb to be a prophet, 
\q To root out, and to afflict, and to destroy; 
\q \add And \add* in like manner to build and to plant. 
\q
\v 8  \add It was \add* Ezekiel who saw the vision of glory,

\v 11 How shall we magnify Zerubbabel? 
\q And he was as a signet on the right hand:

\v 12 So was Jesus the son of Josedek:

\v 6 As the morning star in the midst of a cloud,

\q
\v 11 When he took up the robe of glory, 
\q And put on the perfection of exultation,

\q He made glorious the precinct of the sanctuary. 
\q
\v 12 And when he received the portions out of the priests’ hands,
\q Himself also standing by the hearth of the altar, 
\q His brethren as a garland round about him, 
\q He was as a young cedar in Libanus; 
\q And as stems of palm trees compassed they him round about, 
\q
\v 13 And all the sons of Aaron in their glory, 
\q And the Lord’s offering in their hands, before all the congregation of Israel.
\q
\v 14 And finishing the service at the altars, 
\q That he might adorn the offering of the Most High, the Almighty,
\q
\v 15 He stretched out his hand to the \f +  \ft Gr. \fqa cup of libation.
\f* cup, 
\q And poured out the cup of the grape; 
\q He poured out at the foot of the altar

\q
\v 16 Then shouted the sons of Aaron, 
\q They sounded the trumpets of beaten work,

\v 17 Then all the people together hasted,

\q
\v 1 I will give thanks to you, O Lord, O King, 
\q And will praise you, O God my Saviour: 
\q I do give thanks to your name: 
\q
\v 2 For you were my protector and helper, 
\q And did deliver my body out of destruction, 
\q And out of the snare of a slanderous tongue, 
\q From lips that forge lies, 
\q And was my helper before them that stood by; 
\q
\v 3 And did deliver me, according to the abundance of your mercy, and
\add greatness \add* of your name, 
\q From the gnashings \add of teeth \add* ready to devour, 
\q Out of the hand of such as sought my life, 
\q Out of the manifold afflictions which I had;

\v 5 Out of the depth of the belly of \f +  \ft Gr. \fqa Hades. \f* the grave,

\q \add I was \add* looking for the succour of men,

\q
\v 8 And I remembered your mercy, O Lord,

\q How you deliver them that wait for you, 
\q And save them out of the hand of the enemies. 
\q
\v 9 And I lifted up my supplication from the earth, 
\q And prayed for deliverance from death. 
\q
\v 10 I called upon the Lord, the Father of my Lord, 
\q That he would not forsake me in the days of affliction, 
\q In the time when there was no help against the proud. 
\q
\v 11 I will praise your name continually, 
\q And will sing praise with thanksgiving; 
\q And my supplication was heard: 
\q
\v 12 For you saved me from destruction,

\q Therefore will I give thanks and praise to you, 
\q And bless the name of the Lord. 
\b
\q
\v 13 When I was yet young, 
\q Or ever I went abroad,

\q
\v 14 Before the temple I asked for her,

\v 15 From \add her \add* flower as from the ripening grape my heart delighted in her:

\v 18 For I purposed to practice her, 
\q And I was zealous for that which is good; 
\q And I shall never be put to shame. 
\q
\v 19 My soul has wrestled in her, 
\q And in my doing I was exact: 
\q I spread forth my hands to the heaven above,
