<p>God's Word is protected by God Himself.

Blessed are those who correctly translate, publish, copy, and proclaim faithful copies of God's Word.</p>
<p>Spelling, capitalization, and punctuation were different when the ASV was published. This electronic edition is being conformed to a reference printed text, so the only <a href="http://ebible.org/cgi-bin/comment.cgi">typo reports</a> we are interested in are those where the text does not match the printed text. For a modern English update of the American Standard Version, please see the <a href="http://eBible.org/web/">World English Bible</a> and <a href="http://WorldEnglishBible.org">its variants</a>. This electronic edition aims to include the main text and only the most important footnotes (those which translate text that was omitted because the translators had some doubt about the reliability of the source at the time they did this translation).</p>
