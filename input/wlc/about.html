	<p>Open Scriptures Hebrew Bible</p>
	<p>The Open Scripures Hebrew Bible is a project to analyze the Hebrew Bible
	by lemma and morphology. The project is marked up in OSIS XML and currently
	contains lemma attributes for most words (using Strong's numbers). Soon we
	plan to begin adding morphology attributes as well.</p>
